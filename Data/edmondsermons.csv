010415tx,"Gathering Light V: Honoring the Wisdom of Other Traditions Epiphany Sunday 1-4-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James at EUMC texts: Isaiah 60:1-6 & Matthew 2:1-12  Our text for today, the traditional reading on Epiphany Sunday, is widely known as the story of the three wise men, recorded in Matthews gospel. We might note, however, that Matthew never tells us how many wise men---or magi in the Greek---came to Bethlehem. Tradition holds that there were three, but thats only because they brought three gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  We might also note that while later tradition holds that the visitors were kings---and much later, even gives them names---the magi were not kings, though they may have been advisors to kings. Identified by Matthew as wise men from the East, most likely Persia, or modern-day Iran---the magi were members of the priestly class. In their home country, they sat on the supreme council and had charge of the education of the royal family. They were famous for their skill in astronomy, and had kept records of the movements of the stars for many centuries.  Have you ever noticed that the magi were priests? They werent Jewish priests, though they had a sacrificial system similar to the one practiced in Israel. And like the Jews, they believed in the existence of only one god. The magi performed public rituals and were authorities on religious doctrine. They interpreted dreams and foretold the future. A principle element of magian worship was fire, and on their primary altar burned a perpetual flame.  Have you ever noticed this? That at the manger in Bethlehem, multiple religious traditions are represented? There were at least two, perhaps more. You might even call the nativity scene an interfaith gathering.  The word epiphany means a manifestation, a showing forth of God. It also means a moment in which you suddenly see or understand something in a new or very clear way. The magis visit to the infant Jesus is a moment in time that the church has always referred to as an epiphany: hence Epiphany Sunday. Might the inclusion of multiple religious traditions in the nativity story give us, today, a fresh vision of Gods intent for our world?  Todays world is a global village, connected by commerce and communications to an extent that has hardly been imagined, let alone possible, before now. And its obvious in a new way that, on this shrinking planet, Christianity is just one of the great world religions. Religious pluralism is a fact of life in our own society, as well. Over the last thirty-five years, the United States has become the most religiously diverse nation in the world. Consider the following statistics:i  . There are approximately six million Muslim Americans. There are as many Muslim Americans as there are Presbyterians and Episcopalians combined.  . There are four million Buddhist Americans. That is more than half of the number of United Methodists.  . There are about one million Hindus in the United States, about the same as the membership of the United Church of Christ. What this means for many of us is that the world of our childhood, in which just about everybody we knew was Christian, or perhaps Jewish, has changed dramatically. Most of us have friends, neighbors, and co-workers who are Muslim, Buddhist, or Hindu. As Christians, how should we relate to these neighbors, and to their religious traditions?  We turn to our scriptures for answers. The Bible is a chorus of voices testifyingover a span of about a thousand years---to our spiritual ancestors best sense of Gods presence and Gods leading in this world. And some of these voices, as you know, view adherents of other faiths as beyond the reach of Gods love.  You can find texts in the Bible that suggest that Christianity is the one true religion, and that only Christians will go to heaven when they die. Everyone else, even those whom we know to be good and decent people, even those who have never heard of Jesus Christ, even those who lived before the time of Christ, is utterly condemned and will be sent to a fiery hell. These same texts, as you also know, have been used historically to legitimate the most unspeakable acts of cruelty and arrogance, perhaps unparalleled in the history of world religions, including annihilating and conquering in the name of the truly humble one, Jesus.  But there is an alternate stream of tradition running throughout the Bible, and witnessing to a different view. In Genesis, all people are created by God, and in the image of God. Through Abraham, God forms a particular covenant with the Hebrews, but through Noah, God forms a universal covenant of love for all humanity and all creation. The story of Jonah reveals Gods care for people outside the Hebrew tribe. The Psalmist writes, Let all the nations be glad and sing for joy! The prophet Isaiah proclaims, All the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of God.  Significantly, our Bible holds that there is one God, and no other. Which means that the prayers of all the people in the world are heard by the one God, not by different gods. In Malachi, God says, From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense is offered to my name. In Acts, the apostle Paul preaches that there is no place without its own witnesses to God, this God in whom we all live and move and have our being.  Does it make sense, then, that the God who is Creator of the whole universe---and Lover and Sustainer of all the world---has chosen to be known in only one religious tradition, which just fortunately happens to be our own? ii Anglican Bishop Michael Ingham comments, If we took [that] to be true, it would mean that God condemns the vast majority of the worlds peoples to a hopeless and brutal destiny.iii And how does this square with our faith in a loving and merciful God?  As Christians, we see everything through the particular lens of Jesus Christ. The gospels are our canon within the canon, the authority by which everything else in the Bible is to be evaluated. The gospels portray Jesus as a Jewish rabbi who honored all people, and did not exclude anyone from relationship with God---including members of other religious groups, like a Syro-Phoenecian woman, a Samaritan, and a Roman centurion, all of whom the religious establishment of Jesus day viewed as outside the circle of Gods love.  In Christ, we see a love that overleaps all the dividing lines we human beings try to draw between us and them. In the parable of the sheep and the goats, Jesus says: when it comes time to make such distinctions, it wont be based on whether youve said the right words, or held the correct opinions, but on how youve lived your life. Some will say, But Jesus, I didnt know you! and I will say to them, You knew me. I was hungry and you fed me, I was naked and you clothed meas you did it to the least of my brothers and sisters, you did it to me.  Meanwhile others may have called themselves Christians, but the Master will say, You didnt know me. Depart from me, for I was hungry and you gave me no food, naked and you did not clothe me Jesus says outright: Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but those who do my fathers will. Now, Adolf Hitler called himself a Christian. Mahatma Gandhi was a devout Hindu. But which of them did Gods will?  The Jesus revealed in our gospels tells his disciples, who are worried about competitors in religion, Dont worry; whoever is not against us is for us. He tells them, In my Fathers house are many rooms. He says, I have other sheep, who are not of this fold. When asked, how will we know who they are? Jesus says simply, You will know them by their fruits.  Isnt it time, at this point in history, for us to claim this strand of our Christian tradition, the one exemplified by the magi, the one that Jesus taught and demonstrated? Isnt it beyond time, in this global village where religious ignorance and arrogance are giving rise to torture and terrorism, where suspicion and hostility between religious groups are bringing potential for destruction on a whole new scale, for us to think again about what it truly means to be a follower in the way of Jesus Christ?  Theologian Thomas Berry speaks of what he calls the microphase and the macrophase of any religion. During its microphase, Berry says, when a religious tradition is still young and just forming, the tradition needs to protect its uniqueness by well-defined boundaries. It is like a newly planted sapling that requires care and protection in order to grow. During its microphase, the religions blessings are primarily for those who come within its self-defined boundaries. Those who belong to the tradition are the ones who benefit from its particular graces and ministrations.iv  During a religions macrophase, however, when it has grown up and is well-established, the tradition becomes more secure. It no longer needs to protect and isolate itself, or to defend its view of God---or even to imagine that God needs any defending! In fact, a religion in its macrophase actively seeks out points of contact with other faith traditions. It is open to dialogueincluding mutual critique---and joins with others in service to the world.  Mother Teresa embodied this kind of mature faith when she said, I love all religions, but I am in love with my own.v In its macrophase, religion has no compulsion to impose itself on others, or to coerce or convert others to its own world view. Instead it becomes expansive, and freely offers its blessings to the world, with no strings attached.  Consider the magi, who were humble enough to follow a star, seeking new revelations of the divine. They must have known that if a religion is not growing, changing, and unfolding in new i these are from Diana Eck, A New Religious America (San Francisco: Harper, 2001), referenced by Marcus Borg in The Heart of Christianity: Rediscovering a Life of Faith (San Francisco: Harper Collins Publishers, 2003) p. 209 See also the results of the latest polls by Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, 2007, widely available. ii Borg, Heart, p. 220 iii Michael Ingham, Mansions of the Spirit: The Gospel in a Multi-Faith World (Toronto: Anglican Book Centre, 1997) p. 61 iv John Philip Newell, The Rebirthing of God: Christianitys Struggle for New Beginnings (Woodstock, Vermont: Skylight Paths Publishing, 2014) p. 46 ways, it is dying. The magi were willing to journey into unknown territory. And when they encountered the presence of God in a foreign land and among adherents of another religion, they bowed, as Matthew says, and paid homage. Im intrigued by what theologian John Philip Newell suggests, that the worlds great religions have been given not to compete with each other, but to complete each other.vi The magi---the wise ones---were willing to acknowledge that while they belonged to God, God did not belong exclusively to them.  Then they knelt at the manger, and offered their gifts. Isnt it time for Christianity to do the same? To enter our macrophase, and freely offer our treasures to the world? Not on the basis of whether people choose to become Christian and enter our household of faith, but on the basis of the gifts we have to offer for the well-being of all.  We have so much treasure to share! We hold within our scriptures the awareness of the earths sacredness, and a window into Gods will for the flourishing of all creation---treasures with which to bless the world. Weve been taught practices like forgiveness, non-violent resistance to evil, and care for the poor and sick, foundational for the well-being of any society. In Jesus Christ---in his humility, compassion and honoring of all people---weve seen what spiritual maturity looks like, and what we human beings are called to become, full grown.  Let us look deeply into the nativity scene in Matthews gospel, at the magi offering their gifts, and see the way to peace on earth and goodwill among all people. Let us be among the wise ones of our time.  Amen.               v Quoted in Edward Le Joleys book, We Do It for Jesus: Mother Teresa and Her Missionaries of Charity (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998) vi Newell, Rebirthing, p. 43 "
011115tx,"Gathering Light VI: Dreaming the Way Forward EUMC 1-11-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Habakkuk 2:1-3 & Acts 2:17  Years ago, I went on vacation to Northern California, where I stayed in a cottage on the coast. One morning, as I sat with a cup of coffee at the breakfast table there, I looked out the kitchen window and saw a woman walking down the beach.  The beach was deserted except for this one figure, walking along the waters edge. The morning was beautiful: blue sky, sunrise gilding the sea. The woman was too far away for me to see her face, but she looked to be in her sixties---pretty old, I thought, at the time. Her gray hair was swept back by the ocean wind. She had on a sweater, and a long skirt swirling around her bare calves and feet.  I watched this woman for awhile, taking it in: the way she walked, seemingly at ease in her own skin. She appeared to be immersed in her surroundings, unselfconscious, and unconcerned about whether anyone else might be watching her. As she paused to look out at the water, then bent down to pick up a shell, I imagined that she was curious, intelligent, and appreciative. I thought, I want to be like her.  Now, I realize, of course, that I didnt know any of these things about that real woman who was walking down the beach. I was projecting my own ideals onto her. But that night I wrote in my journal:  The woman on the beach represents the person I want to become, five years from now, or ten years from now. She is at home in the world. She is at peace within herself, able to enjoy both solitude and other people. She loves God, and communes with God in nature. She is open-hearted, welcoming life with joy and generosity. She is not striving all the time. She fits the description in the Book of Proverbs, the line that says: Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come. She is loving and wise.  I hold her in my mind, I went on, so that I might grow into that woman, my best possible future self. So what needs to happen for me to become her? What changes need to be made? For instance, how does that woman spend her time, and with whom? What does she eat, buy, read? What does she do in a typical day? And how can I let this vision of my best future self, the person God is calling me to become, begin to shape my choices and actions now?  Years later, that vision still goes before me. I try to let it guide me, by the power of attraction, into becoming what I have come to think of, in shorthand form, as the woman on the beach. And you know, Im not that woman yet, not fully, but I feel myself growing in her direction.  And I have come to believe, over the years, that this is the way that people make lasting changes in their lives. Not by despising or rejecting who we are now, or feeling guilty about it and scolding ourselves all the time. And not by making big New Years resolutions and willing ourselves to change. But by the power of a compelling vision that goes before us, beckoning us into the future. By giving ourselves to that vision, day by day, and living our way into it.  Do you have a mental picture of your best self, the person you would most like to become? Of course, to be useful, a vision has to be within the realm of possibility. Notice that I didnt picture my future self as a fashion model or the President of the United States. For in fact we dont invent our own vision of the person God is calling us to become. We detect it. Its already within us, like the outlines of an oak tree embedded within an acorn. Its a gift from God, unique for every person, waiting to be realized. Do you have a sense of Gods vision for your life? When you look deeply within yourself, and envision your own highest potential coming into being, what do you see?  In recent years, hundreds of books have been written about the power of living toward a positive vision of the future. Studies have documented how the best athletes (like the Seahawks, for instance!) practice visualizing themselves winning the race or the game. High performers in business do the same: holding a picture of success in mind, then taking concrete steps toward it. Raphael, the great artist, was once asked how he came to produce such wonderful paintings. He replied, I dream dreams and I paint them.  Whether the goal is winning a game or painting a picture, building a bridge or cultivating a warm, loving family life, the outcome literally exists first in our minds, hearts, and imagination. Dreams and visions, intangible as they may seem, have tremendous power. They are the seeds of the future. Theyre continually unfolding, taking us from faith to faith and glory to glory, i as the apostle Paul puts it. As we align our present actions and choices to be more congruent with our dreams and visions, we live them into being.  Here is the scary part of the power of vision. Its almost impossible to rise above the vision you have of yourself, in any area of your life. How we see ourselves---or how we have been taught to see ourselves, for we hold visions up or down for one another---strongly shapes what we become. So our lives and our futures are limited by the absence of vision. Your life, your marriage, your career, your bank account, your health or your children are not likely to be grander than your dreams and visions for them.  When life falls short of our hopes and dreams---as it does, sometimes drastically so---its the vision of a better life, or a different future, that can give us the strength to carry on.  Victor Frankl was a psychologist who survived the death camps of Nazi Germany. While in the camps, he watched others who shared in the ordeal. He wanted to know what made it possible for some people to survive, when most died. The single most important factor, Frankl realized, was a sense of future vision. Those most likely to survive were those who could picture themselves someday writing about this experience, say, or locating a lost loved one, or raising a neighbors child. They held the conviction that they still had a mission to perform, some important work left to do.ii  An athlete endures long hours of training, day after day, because he or she holds the vision of setting a new record. A mother endures the painful labor of childbirth, sustained by the vision of her newborn baby. Hebrews 12:2 declares that Jesus endured the cross because of the joy that was set before him. Our dreams and visions can give us the strength to do great things, and love with great love. They can carry us through present sufferings, and into new life. Whats true for us as individuals is also true in our life together, as a Christian community. For we have been gifted with a vision of our best future self, and the world that God is calling into being. In fact, from beginning to end, the Biblical story is about the power of a compelling vision.  The ancient Hebrews escape from slavery, and wander through the desert for forty yearsled by a vision of the Promised Land. The writer of Proverbs coins a phrase: Where there is no vision, the people perish. Later on, the prophets of Israel hold before them a picture of the future God desires for all people, where the lion will lie down with the lamb, and justice will roll down like watersand this guiding vision shapes their common life.  When the Hebrews are again enslaved and living in exile in Babylon, they draw strength from the prophet Habakkuk, who envisions a future in which they will be freed, saying, in our text for this morning, Write the vision, make it plain upon tablets, so that they may run who read it The prophet Jeremiah adds, For I know the plans I have for you, says God, plans for good and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.  Then Jesus steps into history, reiterating Gods vision for the world, which he calls the Kingdom of God. Jesus preaches about the Kingdom of God more than any other subject, and demonstrates its qualities in everything that he does. The Kingdom of God is his shorthand way of referring to what you and I know, in our bones, this world should be, and will be when Gods will is finally done on earth. Its a picture of human beings living in peace with one another, and in harmony with all creation. The Kingdom of God is what Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa calls Gods dream for the world.iii  The Bible ends with the Book of Revelation, and its glorious vision of the final fulfillment of Gods dream. Planet earth is finally the garden of Eden it was created to be. And there is no war or violence, hunger or sickness, sorrow or suffering, any more.  As Christians, we are a people constituted by this vision. Its a gift from God, seeds of the future planted within us. We are to be a community that points to Gods plan for the world. Jesus says, You are to be a light to the world, a city built on a hill. As a community of Christs disciples, we are not yet the Kingdom of God, but we seek to be growing in that direction, drawn into Gods future by the power of its attraction.  Our task, as a community, is to hold that vision before us. And so we ask questions like: How do people in the Kingdom of God order their common life? How do they treat their children, their elders, their most vulnerable members? How do they spend their time and money? And how can this vision shape the way we live right now, guiding our present choices and behavior? How can we give ourselves to it, day by day, and live our way into it?  Quaker Jim Corbett speaks of what he calls civil initiative. He says that, in contrast to civil disobedience, civil initiative brings about change in the world by proposing and manifesting, more than by opposing and dismantling. That is, evil and oppression are resisted most effectively not by fighting, argument, or even passing resolutions, but by the visible, lived alternative of a community that steadfastly affirms and demonstrates what is holy and good. i Romans 1:17 & II Corinthians 3:18 ii Victor E. Frankl, Mans Search for Meaning (New York: Pocket Books, 1959), pp. 164-66 iii Desmond Tutu with Douglas Abrams, God Has a Dream: A Vision of Hope for Our Time (New York: Doubleday, 2004) As with visions for our individual lives, this shared vision gives meaning and purpose to our days. It gives us the joy of participating in something bigger than ourselves. And when life in this world does fall short---when there is widespread fear and despair, for instance, like that sparked in Paris this week---it leads us to do things like stand in the public square, shoulder to shoulder, holding candles that form the message, We are not afraid. Our shared vision of what life could be and should be in this world gives us the strength to carry on.  Let us dream the way forward. Where there is no vision, the people perish.  Let us write the vision, make it plain upon tablets, so that they may run who read it  For I know the plans I have for you, says God, plans for good and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.  Amen.                            "
011815tx,"Gathering Light VII: Living the Way of Non-violence EUMC 1-16-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: *Matt. 5:38-42 & I Cor. 1:18-29  Today we come to the last in this sermon series called Gathering Light. Each Sunday in this series we have lifted up a theme from within our Christian tradition that---I believe---needs to be reclaimed and recast in order to bring gathering light to the rebirth of Christianity that is called for in our time.  Over these past six weeks, we have looked at the themes of: reconnecting with the earth, awakening compassion, nurturing spiritual practice, celebrating the light, honoring the wisdom of other faith traditions, and dreaming the way forward. Now this morning we come to the last of the seven themes, which is: living the way of non-violence.  To my mind, this is by far the most challenging. Is that true for you as well? All my life, as a Christian, I have struggled with Jesus teaching and example on this theme.  For it is true that Jesus renounced the use of violence, even for a righteous cause, and instructed his followers to do the same. He said, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. He said, Blessed are the peacemakers, and Turn the other cheek. Jesus preached forgiveness, mercy and love. When soldiers came to arrest him and his disciples prepared to fight, he said, Put away your sword. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. In the end, he was willing to die---but not to kill---for the sake of the message he came to proclaim, which, as we saw last week, was all about the peaceable kingdom of God.  Which is a beautiful ideal. And as one who seeks to be a follower of Jesus, I want to embrace it. I do. And I believe, with Jesus, that violence is evil, that violence begets more violence, and that the only way to stop the spiral of violence is to stop being violent. I do believe that this world will not be saved by violence, but by human beings, empowered by grace, following the commandment to love as Jesus loved.  And yetthere is a part of me that also argues with Jesus on this theme. I think: well, violence can never be called a good thing. But given the harsh realities of this world, it may sometimes be the lesser of two evils. Violence can stop the Hitlers of the world; it can save vulnerable people from aggression. How else do you stop world leaders who carry out genocide, or terrorists who commit gruesome and barbaric crimes?  And what about self-defense? In principle, I want to love my enemyand I try. I do. And I dont think Ive ever hit anyone in my life---with the possible exception of my sister when we were small. But Im pretty sure that if I walked into a room where someone was actively hurting one of my grandchildren, and I had a weapon with which to stop them, I would use it. So maybe I am not really a follower of Jesus. Or maybe I am.but only up to a point. Maybe its more accurate to say that I aspire to the life of non-violence that Jesus practiced and preached.but Im not there yet.  How about you? Do you struggle with this issue too? This weekend we celebrate the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was not only a leader in the fight against racial segregation. He was also a Christian, a minister, and one who wrestled mightily with the question of how to fight evil in this world. Perhaps it would be helpful for us, this morning, to trace the spiritual journey that King traveled on what he called his pilgrimage to nonviolence.  At the age of five, young Martin responded to an altar call and dedicated his life to Jesus. But even then he was beginning to question some of the teachings of his father and grandfather, who were both fundamentalist preachers. While they were preaching about how human beings are totally sinful and powerless to change this evil world, but how someday God is going to rain down judgment on evildoers Martin was forming his own ideas, as he encountered evil himself, in the form of racism.  His best childhood friend was a white boy, but when they reached school age, the boys parents put an end to their friendship. Martin was shocked, and when his anxious parents told him that he must show Christian love to white people, he asked, How can I love people who hate me? It seemed more logical to him to return hatred with hatred, and this conviction only gained strength when he was slapped, one day, by a white woman, and on another occasion, when he was angrily shoved to the back of a bus.  As a result, Martin announced in Sunday School, one morning, that he didnt accept a passive, pie-in-the-sky Christianity any more. He was now a rationalist, he said: he believed that the world will be saved not by divine intervention but through the power of human reason. As you might gather, Martin was an unusually intelligent child. He skipped several grades, and entered college when he was only fifteen.  He went to college with the idea of becoming a lawyer, to combat evil with the power of reason. Once there, however, he met a professor of theology who was part of what was called the Social Gospel movement. While the church in which King had grown up stressed the hopelessness of this world and called Christians to focus their hopes on heaven, the Social Gospel called Christians to build the Kingdom of God on earth.  Martin became intensely interested in the possibility of a faith focused on social action. He abandoned his plans to study law and decided to become a minister. He went to seminary, then to Boston University for his Ph.D.. In Boston, King concluded that while his fathers tradition had overstressed the sinfulness of human nature, Protestant liberalism was overly optimistic about the goodness of human beings. Unlike many of his white teachers and classmates, he had seen the face of evil. He had experienced racial hatred and violence first-hand.  Now King came to the theological conclusion on which the rest of his life would be based. It was a synthesis of truths from both his conservative church background and his training in liberal theology. He said: the worlds evil will not be overcome by God acting without human participation, or by humans acting on their own. Social evil is overcome, King said, only when human willingness and Gods power are aligned. On our own, King acknowledged, we human beings can hardly fulfill Jesus command to love our neighbors, much less our enemies. Its simply beyond us. But if we open ourselves in humility to the power and purposes of God, our human nature can be transformed. Our own limited capacity to love can be expanded, and Gods love can be released, through us, into the world.  It was at this time that King was introduced to the life and teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. King saw parallels between the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mountlove your enemy, turn the other cheek---and the practices of Gandhi, who led his people to independence through a strategy of non-cooperation with British rule. Gandhi spoke of satyagraha---which means something like soul-force, and includes the willingness to accept suffering without retaliation---as the greatest power in the world.  King ultimately traveled to India to study Gandhis teachings. Later he wrote, Christ furnished the spirit and motivation, and Gandhi furnished the method. His professors regarded King as one of the brightest students theyd ever had, and encouraged him to devote his life to scholarship. But he argued with them that all great theologians spend some time in the parish. And so, at age 25, he accepted an appointment to become pastor of Dexter Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.  You know the rest of the story. It wasnt long before Kings convictions, developed over ten years of study, were put to the test. Through a rapid series of events, he was catapulted into leading the famous Montgomery bus boycott, an action of nonviolent resistance that eventually dismantled the citys segregated bus system. Subsequent years brought more challenges, as King led the civil rights movement that swept America.  King and his companions sought to follow Jesus by being willing to sufferbut not to inflict suffering---for the sake of what is right. He often quoted Romans 12:21: Overcome evil with good. Or todays text from Corinthians: For Gods foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and Gods weakness is stronger than human strength.  All of this required great courage. The movie Selma, released last week, makes that clear. King and his companions faced clubs and cattle prods, fire hoses turned on peaceful demonstrators, and police dogs loosed on children. He received hate mail and phone calls threatening his family, often as many as 25 in a day. He was imprisoned twelve times. He was stabbed in the chest. His home was bombed twice.  Through all these trials, however, King only became more convinced, as he said, that the universe is under the control of a loving purpose, and that in the struggle for righteousness we have cosmic companionship. He said that in his darkest hours, he could hear Gods voice saying to him, Lo, I will be with you. In pursuing the path of nonviolence, he said, we make the discovery that God is real, and that we are not alone. We are sharing in the very life of God, and participating with God in changing the worldwherever that takes us, whatever it might cost.  Well, what do you think? King, Gandhi, Jesus: were they right? They all suffered violent deaths at the hands of their enemies. Through their practice of non-violent resistance to evil, did the world change? Do we even get to know the results of our efforts, in our lifetimes? I think of Dr. King saying, in response to such questions: You cant decide how you are going to die. You can only decide how you are going to live.  Which might be for us, conflicted as we are, a word of hope. Maybe we dont have to speculate about what we would do under the most extreme duress, when faced, say, with someone who seeks to do violent harm to us or to someone we love. Maybe our own journey toward nonviolence can start smaller, in the simple acts and attitudes of our daily lives, and in circumstances more likely to occur, and occur more often.  We might notice the violence that arises in our heart, for instance, when a driver cuts us off on the freeway. Is there a way to bless and release that person, and let it go? Or the defensive anger we feel when belittled or criticized: can we figure out ways to soothe ourselves without verbally hitting back? Or the righteous, retaliatory response we have to hearing a terrible story on the evening news. Could we offer a prayer instead?  And as we recognize the root causes of violence in ourselves and in our world---like poverty, say, and ignorance, and fear---maybe we can support and participate in efforts to proactively address these issues. And maybe all these practices would shape us, day by day, into persons whoif and when confronted with extreme threat---would be better able to respond in a life-giving way.  It is often said that non-violence is not just a tactic, but a lifestyle to be practiced in every arena of human life. What might that mean for you? What would it look like in the place where you work, the neighborhood where you live? What would it mean for us to actively seek to follow Jesus---and to encourage and support each other along the way--- in our families and friendships, in this church, in everything we do? What if we were to commit ourselves to a pilgrimage toward nonviolence?  Lets find out.  Amen.  "
020115tx,"Left Outside a sermon for Belonging Sunday at EUMC 2-1-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Acts 3:1-10 & I Cor. 12:12-27  Well, today is the big game, and Seahawks fever is running high! Even churches are getting into the spirit. Ive gotten a kick out of some of the messages that have appeared on church signs in our area.  Like the one on a Lutheran church that reads: Jesus Had 12 Men Too. And another that says, No One Is Beyond Gods HelpNot Even the Patriots. But the one I like best is on a church over in Bellevue, which reads: God has no favorites. But the sign guy does. Go Hawks!  So it seems especially appropriate, this morning, to begin with a story about football. Maybe you were one of the four million viewers who caught the You-Tube video of a CBS News On the Road segment that aired last year.i Its about the football team at a middle school in Olivet, Michigan, a team of adolescent boys who acted in a way that is the opposite of the school bullying episodes weve heard so much about in recent years.  Heres what happens in the video. A boy named Keith is walking to school. We are told that Keith is learning-disabled and struggles with boundaries---in the sweetest possible way. We can see his sweet nature for ourselves as he spontaneously embraces each student he meets. He calls out Hug! each time, without missing anyone in his path.  Keith is fairly small in stature and wears glasses. He approaches a large boy, saying, Hug, Gabe! Keith grabs Gabe around the waist. Gabe is wearing his football jersey. Gabe gives Keith a quick, manly sort of sidearm embrace, and the two walk on together.  The scene changes to the football field. The Olivet Eagles make an extraordinary play: two plays, actually. First they run the ball down the field but stop just short of the goal line, to the dismay of their coaches and fans. The team forms up for the next play. The ball is quickly passed to Keith. The team surrounds him in a protective embrace---a kind of group hug---and they hustle him across the line. Keith makes his first ever touchdown!  The team picks up Keith and carries him on their shoulders across the field. Keith flashes an enormous grin, shouting Awesome! CBS turns the camera on the quarterback, who gleefully exclaims, We got this. We were going behind everyones back! Unknown to their coaches and parents, the boys had planned for weeks how to pull off this play. The camera turns to the wide receiver, a boy named Justice, and the reporter asks him why they did it. He explains, We wanted to prove that Keith is part of our team, and means a lot to us.  Turn to our scripture for today, from the Book of Acts. It begins, One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, at three oclock in the afternoon. Peter and John, as you know, were a team. Theyd been friends from youth; they were partners as fishermen; they both received the baptism of John; they both accompanied Jesus to the mount of the Transfiguration. They ran to the tomb together; and after the resurrection, they traveled around together, preaching the good news that God graciously heals and restores lives.  So now Peter and John are going up to the temple together at the hour of prayer, at three oclock in the afternoon. Prayer could be offered at any time or place, but for devout Jews, the ritual of praying at three designated times each day---9 a.m., noon, and 3 p.m.--was important. And if you were in Jerusalem, it was special to offer prayer in the Courts of the Holy Temple.  The temple itself exuded opulence. King Herod had adorned it with gold-decorated roofs and marble columns. According to the Jewish historian, Josephus, the stones used in its construction were so exceedingly white that, from a distance, it resembled a glistening mountain of snow.  The temple also represented exclusion. The lame and the blind were prevented from entering its inner courts. Some point to passages in the ancient texts discovered at Qumran as the rationale for this longstanding discrimination against physically disabled people. Also excluded were Gentiles, meaning non-Jews. And Jewish women were given only restricted access.  We are not to miss the detail that on their way to the temple, Peter and John proceed toward what was called the Beautiful Gate. Ironically, the gate called beautiful performed the ugly task of demarcating insiders and outsiders. For some, the gate stood as an entryway into the blessed community that gathered in the temple. For others, it stood as a barrier reminding them that they were viewed as unworthy of blessing, and unwelcome inside sacred space.  As Peter and John are walking toward the Beautiful Gate, a man who was lame from birth was being carried in. People would lay him daily at the gate of the temple called the Beautiful Gate so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple. Acts 4:22 tells us that this man was over 40 years old. From birth, we are told, he was lame. Which means his parents never saw him take a first step. He could not share in the games of other children. When he came to adulthood, he was unable to work, so he had to beg. Every day someone would bring him to the same spot, leave him there at the Beautiful Gate, and pick him up again that evening.  It was a good place to beg, beside the gate through which people were going to the temple. In Hebrew society, wealth was considered a loan from God, and the poor had a certain claim on the possessions of the rich. The rich were instructed to share God's bounty with the poor. The lame man begged with this expectation in mind.  Now comes the key action of this text. Its a game changer, you might say. Most people passing through the gate would avert their eyes from the lame man, distressed or embarrassed by his condition, and toss a few coins onto his blanket, or not. Others would hurry by, not even seeing him, theyre so used to him being there, day after day---the way we do, perhaps, when we drive past a street corner where a panhandler holds a cardboard sign. But Peter and John see the disabled man, and come to a full stop. Our text says that they look intently at him, and invite him to look intently at them.  The Greek word that appears here is atenizo, from which we get our English word attention. Peter and John now focus their full, loving attention on the man who is lame. Here and throughout the Book of Acts, Luke uses this word atenizo to mean a kind of looking intently that opens peoples eyes to a deeper presence, a deeper reality. When people look intently in the Book of Acts, they become more aware of the sacredness of that upon which they gaze. I cant explain the healing power of God, but I believe in it. How could I not? Ive experienced it! So often you and I have no time or inclination to look intently at anything, even the people closest to us, let alone a discomforting stranger who intrudes on our plans for the day. But when, by Gods grace, we stop and look deeply and lovingly at one another, something of God is awakened or set free.  I suspect that the beggar lying beside the Beautiful Gate had himself come to believe that he was useless and a burden. Perhaps no one ever looked intently with love upon him. But Peter and John look beyond the superficialities of his physical condition and social standing. They see this man, and treat him, as a brother in Christ, as a valuable and beautiful child of God. In their seeing, the man sees something new in himself. And the healing power of God is released.  The man looks steadily back at Peter and John. Expecting charity, he doesnt think to hope for more. Peter says, I have no silver or gold, but what I have I give you; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk. He reaches out a hand; the mans eyes widen; and the text goes on: And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately [the mans] feet and ankles were made strong. Jumping up, he stood and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.  The one who had been left outside the community all his lifeis invited in. The one who has been excluded and ostracized is embraced---and healed. Cant you just see him, on his way into the temple, leaping and praising God? He flashes an enormous grin, shouting Awesome! Peter exclaims, We got this. We were going behind everyones back! And John explains to the gathering crowd, We wanted to prove that he is part of our team, and means a lot to us.  Notice what happens next. All the people saw him walking and praising God, and they recognized him as the one who used to sit and ask for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. In other words, not just one persons life is changed by this encounter. The whole community is freshly aware of the presence of God in their midst. The community, too, is healed and transformed.  Go back to that video on You-Tube, the CBS camera still trained on the young wide receiver. The reporter presses him, asking, Why did this affect you so much? And we, watching this news story, are witness to another powerful moment. Tears form in the boys eyes and begin to spill down his cheeks. Hes a teenage boy on national TV, but he doesnt reach up and dash the tears away, or hang his head in embarrassment.  Instead he seems to be processing his thoughts and feelings aloud as he says slowly, Keiths never been like, cool or popular. He went from, like, being a nobody to making everyones dayI went from mostly caring about myself and my friends to caring about everyone. CBS concludes the news story with the line, This may have been the most successful play of all time. Luke, our scripture writer, would agree.  When any one of us is no longer left outside, all of us are made more whole.  Amen. i Thanks to Lisa Ashley for pointing me to this video, which can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ejh_hb15Fc.  "
020815tx,"A Theology of Place a sermon preached at EUMC 2-8-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Psalm 84:1-7 & Acts 17:24-28  What comes to mind when you hear the words sacred place? Close your eyes, if you like, and picture the physical setting that makes you feel most deeply at home in the world, most truly yourself, and closest to God.  For many of us, the place that comes to mind is the natural landscape of our childhood. I grew up in Southern California, for instance. When I close my eyes and picture the geography that was my first spiritual home, I see blue sky, the sloping shoulders of tanned hills, and a glittering sea. I smell eucalyptus trees and fresh oranges. I recognize a certain quality of light, and a balmy weight in the ocean air.  I call to mind a memory of myself as a child on roller skates, holding my arms out to the sides and being literally blown down the street---along with several tumbleweeds---by a hot Santa Ana wind. Or being on the school playground, a silent shadow moving across the black pavement, and looking up to see a huge California condor gliding overhead.  When you picture the landscape that is most primal or central in your psyche, what do you see? Perhaps it is not where you grew up, but a place you visited or in which you settled down. Perhaps it is right here in the Pacific Northwest. Perhaps your first or strongest memories are located in this mossy landscape of gray mists and green forests, silvered logs on old beaches, and the Olympic Mountains floating above a blue haze.  To hold such landscapes in mind is to begin to understand the importance of place in our lives. Its to begin to understand why we feel a sudden kinship with a stranger who, we discover, grew up in the same locale that we did. And why people come again and again to worship here in this sanctuary, and why some feel more at home sitting in the same pew---the same place---every week. It is to begin to understand why, when we speak of our spiritual journeys, we tell stories of times and places in which God has been most real to us.i  Our Bible begins with the awareness that we human beings are finite creatures. If the infinite God is to be revealed to us, it has to be within the particularities of time and place---that is to say, of history and geography----in which we humans live. Hence the Bible points to a God who not only creates this world, but also inhabits it. The Psalms speak of the earth as Gods temple, the place of Gods abode. The gospels tell of a God who takes on human flesh and dwells among us. The message of the Bible is that God is not only enthroned afar but also truly, deeply present in the earthly places of our human lives.  The ancient Hebrews also had this strong sense of Gods presence in particular locations. They told the story of Jacob, who had been sent into exile by his mother, who had feared that her twin sons would kill each other. Just as Jacob was heading into the unknown territory of a new land, he slept and dreamt of a ladder that connected heaven and earth, with messengers of light ascending and descending all around him. When he awoke, he said, Surely the Lord was in this place---and I didnt know itthis is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.ii He erected a stone on that site, and poured oil upon it, to create an altar in the world. Later on, after theyd crossed over the Jordan River into the Promised Land, the Hebrews took twelve stones from the river, each representing one of the twelve tribes of Israel. They erected a monument, as the Book of Joshua records: that this may be a sign among you, when your children ask in time to come, What do these stones mean? Then you shall tell themiii about how God liberated their people from slavery, and led them through this river to freedom. The stones marked the spot as a place where the presence of God had been revealed.  If we were fully enlightened beings, we would probably realize that the gateway to heaven is everywhere on earth. But for most of us, this is to easier to grasp in some places than in others. And so human beingslike the ancient Hebrews---have always pointed to certain locations where God has been encountered in an especially powerful way.  Over time, these have been marked with stones and altars, and later with temples and shrines. Such sacred places often become the destination points of pilgrimage, like Jerusalem, Rome, or Mecca. Two summers ago, you may remember, I went on pilgrimage to sacred sites in the British Isles. I visited places like the island of Iona, which draws 200,000 pilgrims each year.  Theres something immensely powerful about praying in a space where people have chanted prayers and lit candles and left offerings, for thousands of years. But other places, too, not necessarily recognized as sacred places, become important to us in our own individual lives. I can list some of those in my spiritual journey: like Yosemite National Park, the Oregon coast, Holden Village in the Cascade Mountains, and the first church I served as pastor, Wallingford United Methodist Church in Seattle, which, like many sacred sites, is quite literally built over a wellspring of living water (just ask the Trustees about that).  Is this true for you, too? Can you name particular places where you have sensed the presence of God, the God who is actually present everywhere? Thats the function of sacred places, after all. By their beauty or history or connection with particular events in your life, they invite you into fuller awareness of the presence of God in all places and all lives. In our text for today, from the Book of Acts, the apostle Paul puts it this way:  From one ancestor God made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would search for God and grope for God and perhaps find Godthough indeed [the Holy One] is not far from each one of us. For In God we live and move and have our being.iv  Why do we look, today, at this theme of a theology of place? Why is it so important for us to reclaim, from within our Christian tradition, a sense of God that begins in the particularities of specific places, but points us to the sacredness of all the earth?  I can think of two reasons. The first, and probably the most obvious, is what the apostle Paul calls the groaning of creation. The environmental crises of our time pose an urgent need for us to rediscover what weve neglected, or forgotten: that God is known in and through all the landscapes on earth. That the earth is not some thing that God created and left, for us to use or abuse. It is deeply infused with Spirit. The ecological crisis is a spiritual crisis.  Thomas Berry, who died in 2009, might be called the first Christian prophet of the protection of the earth. A theologian and cultural historian by training, Berry preferred to call himself a geologian. He drew theologys attention to painful realities like the extinction spasm that is now occurring in places around the globe. Over three hundred species a week are becoming extinct, in part because of how we humans are choosing to live---or more precisely, not to live---in relationship with the natural world. In the last century we have undone much of what it took the earth four billion years to evolve.  What is urgently needed, Berry said, is what he called a theology of radical immanence. Given the excessive orientation of Christian theology toward the wholly Otherness of God, especially in the last few hundred years, he said, we need to move from a spirituality of alienation from the natural world to a spirituality of intimacy with the natural world.v  I think of a line I once heard that has stayed with me: That which we refuse to contemplate, we will tend to exploit. If, for instance, we see geographical place only as a surface reality and in utilitarian terms, the earth becomes vulnerable to exploitation, especially manipulation for short-term gain. But if we contemplate Gods presence within any place, we become aware that we are standing on holy ground. Like Moses before the burning bush, we take off our shoes. We treat that place with reverence and respect.  Which brings us to the second reason for renewing and developing a Christian theology of place. Much has been written in recent years about the rootlessness, or placelessness of modern life. As biblical scholar Walter Brueggemann writes, The sense of being lost and homeless is pervasive in contemporary culture. Loss of place, and yearning for place, are dominant images.vi  Add to these the factors of increased mobility, a workforce thats expected and often required to be transient, fast-food chains, stores and strip malls that look pretty much the same in every place, and the rise of electronically-generated virtual placesand our sense of dislocation deepens. Pastor and scholar Eugene Peterson, who wrote the popular paraphrase of the Bible called The Message, says: We live much of our lives in exile, so to be able to spot the people and places that re-establish our true identity is so important.vii  In his book entitled, This Place on Earth, Alan Durning, a globe-trotting researcher, describes the experience that led him to move back to his hometown of Seattle, and put down deeper roots. He was, he says, in the Philippines, interviewing members of remote hill tribes about their land and livelihood. As he tells it:  a gap-toothed chief showed me the trees, streams and farm plots that his tribe had tended for centuries. It was territory, he insisted, that they would defend with their lives. As the sun finally slid lower in the sky, he introduced me to a frail old woman who was revered by the others.We sat under a sacred tree near her farm and looked out over the river. She asked through an interpreter, What is your homeland like?viii  Durning found her question embarrassing. She repeated her question, thinking I had not heard. Tell me about your place. Again, I could not answer. The truth was, I lacked any connection to the city where my family lived at that time. In America, I finally admitted, we have careers, not places. Looking up, I recognized pity in her eyes.  I can understand Durnings subsequent decision to come home, to re-find and reclaim his own place in the world. Because I, too, dont want geography to be mere scenery, a generic backdrop against which I have experiences. I want to bow before the dignity and innate mystery of the landscape where I am placed, and out of which my experience grows.  I dont want to move through this world as a tourist, skimming along the surface and collecting souvenirs. I want to be a pilgrim, looking for the presence of God in every place.  And I want to live out my days---whether in the Southwest or here in the Pacific Northwest, both of which are part of me now---with a resonating sense of being at home in the world. I want to live in a landscape that I know and love. A place to which I am committed. A place where I live in community with my neighbors. A place through which I commune, ever more intimately, with God.  Is this true for you, too?  This sanctuary is a sacred place. Picture us here right now, and let it sink into our bones: the pearl-gray clouds, the slate of sea, the salt-tang of cool morning air, the gulls in a row on the roof, the breathing of people around us, the light filtering through the soft colors of stained glass. Let us rest here, this morning, and be renewed. Let us know ourselves to be deeply at home, truly ourselves, and close to God.  Amen.            i Thanks for thoughts in this paragraph to a sermon preached by the Rev. Donald W. Henderson at the First Congregational Church of Camden, Maine, on August 9, 1981, shared with me by Larry Nilson. ii Genesis 28:10-17 iii Joshua 4:1-7 ivIve read that in the town of New Harmony, Indiana, there is a place of prayer called the Roofless Church. I hope to worship there sometime. The sanctuary of the church has four defining walls, but no roof: it sits wide open to the elements. Its founder built the Roofless Church more than fifty years ago with the idea that our holy gathering spaces must not be closed in or closed off, but continually open outward to all the places, people, creatures, and cultures of this one world that God loves, and inhabits. v Thomas Berry, The Great Work (New York: Bell Tower, 1999), ix and 164, summarized and quoted by John Philip Newell in The Rebirthing of God (Woodstock, Vermont: Skylight Paths, 2014) pp. 10-11 vi Walter Brueggemann, The Land (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1977) vii Eugene Peterson, The Wisdom of Each Other: A Conversation Between Spiritual Friends (Grand Rapids: Zondervan) p. 85, quoted in Leonard Hjalmarson, No Home Like Place: A Christian Theology of Place (Portland: Urban Loft Publishers, 2014) p. 173 viiiviii Alan Durning, This Place on Earth: Home and the Practice of Permanence (Seattle: Sasquatch, 1996) p. 3, quoted in the Foreward to Hjalmarsons book noted above, pp. 17-18, and written by Loren Wilkinson "
021515tx,"Making Love Last a sermon on St. Valentines Day weekend EUMC 2-15-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 & I Corinthians 13 (Message)  In preparation for todays sermon, I studied the Bible, interviewed a therapist I respect very much, reflected on my own years as a pastor and as a counselor, and looked at several good books on relationships. I also solicited input from you, the members of this congregation, by sending out an e-mail inviting your responses to the question, In your experience and observation, what makes for a healthy and long-lasting marriage, partnership, or friendship?  Today you have the chance to hear from each other on this topic. And there is so much corporate wisdom in this room! Consider this e-mail that came from Normagene Gavin:  Jim and I have been married 70 years as of last January 18th . When I turned 14, he started taking me home from school on his bike, so we have a real history. We have always enjoyed each other, and still do. He just bought me my 75th box of valentine chocolates.  The big challenge, this morning, is how to organize all this rich material into something that can be said in fifteen minutes! So consider this sermon simply a starting point for continued conversation. Well follow an outline of three parts, each clustered under a biblical text.  First well look at things that are destructive in relationships, warning signs to watch out for if youre seeking long-lasting love. Then the bulk of our time will be spent on naming some of the habitual practices that contribute to long-lasting marriages, partnerships, and friendships. Finally well consider the meaning of the third cord in todays text from Ecclesiastes. So here we go. Our first scripture reading, naming some of the things that work against long-lasting love relationships, comes from the 4th chapter of Ephesians:  So then, putting away falsehood, let us speak the truth to our neighbors, for we are members of one another. Be angry but do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your angerLet no evil talk come out of your mouths, but only what is useful for building up, so that your words may give grace to those who hear. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God Put away from you all bitterness and wrath and wrangling and slander, together with all malice.  Well, theres a mouthful of things to avoid if your goal is a lasting love relationship! Dishonesty, evil talk, bitterness, wrath, wrangling, slander, malice.does that sound like any relationship you know?  One of the intriguing lines in this text is Be angry, but do not sin. Which holds the implicit acknowledgement that conflict and anger are inevitable in any relationship. No two individuals are exactly the same in their values, outlooks, opinions, or temperaments, or should they be! And life itself, over time, will inevitably bring external challenges. The question, then, is how two people can work out their differences and deal with stressors in ways that are helpful, rather than harmful, to their relationship.  One of the great resources we have here in our area is the work of John Gottman, Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Washington. Gottman has conducted years of research and written numerous books about relationships. i ii Hes gained some notoriety by his claim that he can predict, within five minutes of observing a married couple in his laboratory, whether their marriage will end in divorce. So far, he says, he has done this with 91% accuracy!  Gottman identifies four warning signs to look for in the way that a couples deals with conflict, which he refers to as the four horses of the apocalypse. The four horses you really want to keep at bay, he says, are: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and cold withdrawal. When these become habitual patterns of communication between two people, they can easily harden into perpetually negative thoughts and feelings. Not surprisingly, perpetually negative thoughts and feelings have profound consequences for how partners in a relationship treat each other.  The writer of Ephesians names: evil talk, bitterness, wrath, wrangling, slander, malice. Such habitual practices can prompt partners to flee into infidelities and other forms of betrayal. They can cause a widening icy emptiness between two people, or spiral progressively downward into living nightmares of verbal and/or physical abuse.  So here at the outset I want to acknowledge a harsh truth: that not all couples should stay together. Sometimes the negativity has gone too far and the damage done is just too great. Over the years, I have come to believe that divorce is always a tragedy---but sometimes, in some circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils. Ending a relationship may be preferable to staying in one that has become dangerously entrenched in patterns of destructiveness.  But certainly most marriages, partnerships, and important friendships can succeed. When other habits of interaction are cultivated and brought to bear, differences in a relationship can actually become opportunities for growth. Hardships and difficulties can even become initiations into deeper love. How does this happen? What factors move a relationship in that direction? Turn to a second scripture for this morning, from Colossians 3:  As Gods chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. Bear with one another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each other; just as the Lord has forgiven you... Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.  I ask you: what is the opposite of contempt, which Gottman says is the #1 killer of relationships? The opposite of contempt for another person is love and respect. And from the e-mails that you sent this week, all of you agree with Gottman that what most everyone is looking for, and needs to give and receive in important relationships, are these two things: love and respect.  Its important to note, here, that love and respect are not onlyor even mainly---emotions. They are attitudes of the heart, expressed in concrete actions. Feelings like passion, delight and even joy come and go, to be welcomed and celebrated. But love---or agape, in the Greek of the New Testament---is an act of will, an unwavering devotion to the well-being of another person. Agape is a commitment to demonstrate love even when you do not feel it. In fact, when you persistently do love toward another person, an amazing thing often happens. Your loving actions generate loving feelings. Its often said that John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, used to tell his ministers to preach faith until you have it, then preach it all the more. A parallel is true in relationships: Practice love until you feel it, then love all the more. How do you practice unwavering devotion to the well-being of another? Listen to some of the advice of your friends here in church:  One person writes: Love each other intentionally and purposefully. Another says: it takes time and energy to keep the connection vital. We must honor our loved ones by expressing our love in words, hugs, and the gift of time spent together. Make the relationship a priority, you say. Bring to it your best energy and resources. One couple draws up this list:  Communicate clearly about your daily life together. Dont go to bed angry and keep as much humor in your relationship as you can. Touch, hold hands, kiss whenever the moment presents itself. Support each other in independent ventures. If you have children living at home, find time for a date night. Find fun ways to let your spouse know they are loved. Notice that none of the things on this list are feelings, but actions that demonstrate love and respect.  Others offere similar counsel: Consider and treat your spouse as your best friend and teammate. Throw in honesty, respect, caring and trust in each other, enjoyment in sharing our projects and interests and willingness to set aside our own personal desires if they are in conflict with or would bring pain to the other. At the same time, remember that every relationship, like every individual, is unique. Reinvent your lives together as you go, and constantly support each others freedom to grow and change.  Many of you stress communication.  Communicate frequently, you wrote,  about money, sex, religious beliefs, in-laws, jobs, friends, likes, dislikes, hopes, dreams, children A man writes: What I consider vital is listening. Really listening, giving your full attention Listening can be a very personal, intimate offering -- a gift that, in the moment, only you can give. Kindness is another recurrent theme. You write: We often treat those we love the most with our very worst behavior ---try not to do that. And: The little things are often the big things---when I'm in a rush getting out the door, finding my windshield freshly scraped on an icy cold morning is, well, a romantic gesture!  Many of you emphasize the importance of humor. I enjoyed one message that begins: Bill and I will be celebrating 48 years of marriage this summer... I often wonder how this happened. Seriously, I mean it... Another cites a book entitled A Marriage Made in Heaven  Or: Too Tired for an Affair. Another writes: There isn't much I love more than to lie awake at night, giggling with my sweetheart while the kids snooze. After working hard to juggle our jobs and family responsibilities, a little silliness goes a long way to bring each of us back to ourselves. You also add: are we allowed to give a shout out for sex and other forms of physical intimacy? I know it's church and all, but God does want us to love one another!  Many of you also highlight the willingness to overlook each others faults and foibles. One woman writes: My mother used to say: if you don't like something about him, zip your lip and change the subject. You have no idea how often Ive thought of her advice. Another says: Practice patience and forgiveness; we're all a work in progress. And: Say I'm sorry--- plain and simple. Don't say, I'm sorry, but... Leave your but out of your apology! And almost all of you advise sticking with it, even when hardships come. A man writes: Any relationship with depth or substance will experience dark times, some worse than others. We choose how to respond. We can love more or we can love less. I try my best to always love more. A woman writes: Dont give up. Relationships can turn around with good support, friends and lots of prayer. Learn to listen with your heart and be slow to respond. God has placed in us the ability to heal through love. It is the strongest power in the universe.  Notice that all of you are writing about things to do to nourish an important relationship. Not about trying to feel feelings, but about words and actions that demonstrate love and respect. Gottman, the marriage expert in Seattle, maintains that for a relationship to thrive, day to day, there must be a precise, scientifically provable ratio of five to one. That is, for every negative interaction between the two people, there must be five positive interactions. Thus, Gottman says, his best advice is to revere each other and be grateful that you are in each others life.iii  Which brings us to our last scripture, from Ecclesiastes, chapter 4: Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up the otherAgain, if two lie together, they keep warmAnd though one might prevail against another, two will withstand one. A threefold cord is not quickly broken. The first few lines of this passage make sense: Two are better than one. But what is the writer referring to in the last line, A threefold cord is not quickly broken? What is the third cord?  The image here is of a third partner, or a third reality in a relationship, to which both parties are devoted together. This third reality gives the relationship shared meaning and purpose. It is a source of unity and strength to which both partners can turn. In a Christian marriage, this third cord is God, which makes the marriage covenant very difficult to break.  I think of an elderly couple I once knew who told me that every night before sleep they would lie in bed, holding hands, and pray for each other, their loved ones, the community, and the world. Such a beautiful image, and it was how they lived, too. When you see your relationship as a ministry from God, given to bless not only you but others too, thats a powerful third cord.  So let me close with excerpts of two more e-mail messages, from such couples in this congregation. After almost 44 years of marriage, Beth and Bruce Cooke write: You may not know exactly where you are going but the joy should be in the journey. Be flexibleRemain intimate Cherish each day and its gift of time, place, and people. Be aware always of Christ's love for you, your partner, and your relationship. Expeditions require lots of work, but the payoff is priceless!  And from our beloved Lay Leaders, the spiritual elders of this tribe, Floyd and Janet Barker: The obvious answers are love, communication, trust, troth pledged is troth kept, etc. But, as important are --a compromising spirit and the understanding that we entered into this marriage with the mindset that failure was not an option. 58 years later, here we are, thankful for those years and looking forward to the future, one day at a time.  Thanks be to God! Amen.  i See three books by Gottman that I looked at for this sermon, and highly recommend, in this order: Why Marriages Succeed or Failand How You Can Make Yours Last (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1994); John Gottman and Nan Silver, The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work (New York: Three Rivers Press, Random House, 1999); and John Gottman and Nan Silver, What Makes Love Last?

022215tx,"What Kind of King Is Jesus? 1st Sunday in Lent at EUMC 2-22-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Zechariah 9:9-10 & Mark 11:1-11  Two weeks ago, I received a phone call from my sister, who is undergoing treatment for breast cancer. In the course of our conversation, I made a comment to the effect, Well probably find out someday that the cause of so much cancer today is something we are doing to ourselves. Some poison weve put into our environment, or some kind of chemicals were using  Yes, my sister said, or some by-product of our lifestyle, like the Romans who died of lead poisoning after building a water-supply system using lead pipes. And then my sister, who has strong opinions about a number of things, was off and running in a comparison of the ancient Roman Empire and the American Empire of today.  There are so many parallels, she said. Rome was a republic that built and ruled an empire: so are we. Rome set up an economic system by which the worlds wealth would flow into it: so do we. Romans felt entitled to tribute from subject nations: Americans consume 75% of the worlds resources, and consider it our right. And Rome enforced that whole set-up through laws and military might: we send in armies of occupation, too, wherever our economic interests need protecting. Which pretty much means were fighting wars in far-off places most of the time.  My sister went on. (Can you tell that she is a college professor?) And then there are the cultural similarities, she said. The growing gulf between rich and poor, and a shrinking middle class. Did you read the news just a few months ago, she said, that 1% of the U.S. population now owns more wealth than all the rest of us combined? In spite of our noble ideals about democracy, our country---like Rome---is really controlled by a wealthy elite. And we have our own slave class: what else do you call the millions of undocumented workers on whom our economy depends?  And dont even get me started on the moral state of our society, she said. Promiscuity and pornography. The use of sex to sell everything from cars to toothpaste. The celebration of violence: just turn on the TV any night of the week. Entertainment that glorifies winners and revels in the public humiliation of losers: look at all the shows in which people compete until only one is left standing, from singers to cooks to bachelors to our own gladiatorial athletes. Havent you ever noticed how our sports stadiums resemble the Roman Coliseum?  OK, I said. Can we talk about something else now? Sure, she said, as long as you let me add the super-patriotism and inflated self-importance that were rampant in Rome just before it fell. It all adds up to two very similar histories. And we know what history does, over and over again  Ok! I said. I get it. But its hard to hear. Because most of the Romans I knowI mean, most of the Americans I know---are good and decent people. We may hold positions of privilege in the world by accident of where we were born, and for which we are grateful. But most of the people I know, as individuals, are honest, responsible, and hard-working. Theyre not trying to hurt or oppress anybody. Theyre faithful to family and friends, generous toward the less fortunate, and trying to do some good in the world.  Thats not the point, my sister said. The issue is not our character---good or bad---as individuals, but our participation in economic and political systems that we have shaped and enforced which do hurt and oppress others, and from which we benefit.  Well, that was a sobering phone call. Im reminded of the saying that the gospel is bad news before it is good news. In other words, the world we live in---and participate in---is messed up. We may not have personally created all the structures of evil and injustice in the world, but given their existence and our places within them, what shall we do?  As Christians, we believe that Jesus embodies Gods answer to human sin---and not just personal sin, but social, economic, and political sin as well. Jesus shows us the way to a transformed world, a world of justice, prosperity, and peace. And his way---Gods way of healing the world---is revealed most clearly in the events of the last week of his life, which we call Holy Week.  So this morning we start our Lenten journey through the unfolding of that final, holy week. We will follow the themes in a book that inspired this series and that I want to recommend to you. Its entitled The Last Week, by Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan.i The journey begins, as they point out, with two processions into the city of Jerusalem.  The first procession, on a spring day in the year 30, was led by Pontius Pilate, the governor of the region. Historians record that Pilate and a contingent of Romes finest led a parade of cavalry and foot soldiers into Jerusalem through the western entrance to the city. It was---and was intended to be---an impressive display of Roman power and might.  Imagine the spectacle of that procession. It was led by golden eagles mounted on poles, emblems of the empire that ruled, like a powerful predator, over the Hebrews and their Holy City. There were cavalry soldiers mounted on prancing war steeds. Foot soldiers clad in leather armor, polished to a high gloss. On each centurions head, a helmet of hammered metal. At each ones side, a sword crafted from the hardest steel. In his hands, each soldier carried a spear, or if he were an archer, a bow, with a quiver of arrows slung across his back.  They march into the city, row upon military row, kicking up a swirling cloud of dust. Sunlight glints on all that metal and gold. There is the marching of feet, the clanking of weapons, the ominous beating of drums. All of it calculated to inspire fear and awe in the silent onlookers. Which was especially important this week, when Jerusalem was crowded with pilgrims, and the city had swelled to six times its normal population.  The pilgrims had streamed into Jerusalem for the Jewish festival of the Passover, which the Romans allowed. It was also standard practice for the Roman governor of a foreign territory to be in its capital for religious celebrations. So Pilate has to be present, coming in from the seaside palace where he prefers to spend his time. But it could not have been lost on Pilate and his advisors that Passover was a celebration of the liberation of the Jews from a previous empire, the empire of Egypt. Hence this show of Roman strength today.  Ever since the Romans had occupied this land some eighty years previously, rebellion had been always in the air. The Jews were a people with a long memory and stubborn hope. Their last major rebellion had been twenty-six years before, after the death of Herod the Great, who was king at the time Jesus was born. That uprising had started in Galilee, about five miles from Jesus boyhood home in Nazareth. It had been swiftly and brutally put down.  After that the Romans had marched on Jerusalem. There they crucified over 2,000 Jews who were accused of being part of the uprising. Crucifixion was the method of execution used for insurrectionists. The horrifying sight of 2,000 crosses lining the roads into Jerusalem had effectively intimidated the population. The Roman Empire had made its intolerance of rebellion well-known. Thus was the Pax Romana, the famous Roman peace, maintained.  On this spring day, Pilates procession into Jerusalem is meant to remind the Jews of what had happened the last time a major uprising was attempted. It sends a warning to anyone who, fired up by the excitement of Passover, might be foolishly plotting against Rome. The Temple would be the center of Passover activity. The Roman garrison, built adjacent to the Temple compound, would serve as a good vantage point from which to keep an eye on the Jews. With a calculating, cool confidence, Pilates procession proceeds in that direction.  Now, a second procession into Jerusalem was also taking place on that same day. At the time it must have seemed vastly less important. This procession, led by a Jewish rabbi coming in from the countryside, enters on the opposite side of the city. And there is every indication that it was a pre-arranged counter-procession, intended to demonstrate the opposite of the first.  Jesus times his entry to coincide with Pilates procession. Hes come down from Galilee, a hundred miles to the north, where he has been preaching among the people, mostly peasants, about the great passion of his life, the Kingdom of God. Its important to know that in the time of Jesus, the phrase Kingdom of God was an explicitly political term. It referred to a social and economic order very different from what his hearers knew and experienced every day.  By the phrase, Kingdom of God, Jesus meant the opposite of the tyranny of earthly kings and empires. He was holding up a vision, like the Hebrew prophets before him, of a realm of justice, prosperity, and security for everyone. Meaning the opposite of the central dynamic of empire: which is political and economic domination of the many by a few. As the late Marcus Borg puts it, the term Kingdom of God signifies what life would be like on earth if God were king, and the rulers of this world were not.ii  So Jesus stages his counter-procession. Our text says, When they were approaching Jerusalemnear the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples and said to them, Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden; untie it and bring it. If anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? just tell them, The Lord needs it  These would be very strange instructions if we did not know, as Jesus hearers certainly knew, that he was quoting from Zechariah, Chapter 9. There is more to that passage than a description of Jesus preferred mode of transportation. The prophet Zechariah is speaking to the nation. He is reassuring the Hebrews that God has not forgotten them:   But I will defend my house against marauding forces. Never again will an oppressor overrun my people, for now I am keeping watch. Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the war-horses from Jerusalem, and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea, andto the ends of the earth.  In other words, Jesus is quoting from the prophet Zechariah, and reminding his listeners of the entire passage. Its message is, God will deliver the nation from the oppressor ---which, in Jesus day, is Rome. But this king will come to them humbly, not on a steed of war, but on a slow-moving donkey. This king will banish war from the landno more chariots, war-horses, or bows. Commanding peace to the nations, he will be a king of peace.  The procession begins as Jesus and his group crest a hill called the Mount of Olives, two hundred feet above the Temple compound of Jerusalem. The road snakes down the hill, through the olive groves and into the Eastern Gate of the city. Crowds begin to gather. Unlike the silent, sullen watchers of Pilates procession, they lay coats and palm branches across the path---the only thing they have with which to express honor, acclaim, and rising hope.  Cheers ring out: Hosanna! which comes from Psalm 118 and was used at the festival of Passover, meaning, Save now! Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Others shout, Hosanna in the highest heaven! How fitting that these words, echoing the angels song at Jesus birth, should also herald the beginning of his last week. Can you see how this dramatic action sets up a kind of street theater, in which the contrasts are made clear? Pilate and his military enforcers represent one kind of kingdom. Jesus and his followers, in their peaceful demonstration, represent another. Pilate and his troops exist to serve a wealthy elite. Jesus and his disciples come as the humble servants of all. Pilate asserts the might of the worlds Superpower, which tolerates no opposition. Jesus embodies the shalom---the peace and well-being of all people ---that God desires.  On this first day of the last week of Jesus life, a contrast between kings and kingdoms is on display. The two processions could not be more different. And those who watch will make a choice. I wonder: if we had been there on that day in Jerusalem, which procession would we have chosen to follow?  Our own Lenten journey now begins with this question. Will we give ourselves to the way things are in this world, or the way God intends them to be? Will we place our trust in the power to inspire fear, or the power of vulnerable love? Two visions, two kingdoms, two processions. Which procession are we in right now? Which procession do we want to be in?  What will we choose?

030115tx,"Trouble in the Temple 2nd Sunday in Lent at EUMC 3-1-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Jeremiah 7:5-11 & Mark 11:15-19  Last Sunday, you may remember, we looked at the first day of the last week of Jesus life. On that day, now known as Palm Sunday, Jesus and his disciples enacted a deliberate lampoon of Pilate and his soldiers. As the Romans paraded into Jerusalem in a grim display of military strength, Jesus and his disciples created a kind of street theater, hailed by the crowds, in fulfillment of the ancient prophecy of Zechariah:  See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.  As provocative as that action was, it pales in comparison to what Jesus does on the second day. We might consider it a continuation of his entry into Jerusalem, a further expression of the same protest. In fact, last weeks text ends by telling us that after entering Jerusalem on a donkey, Jesus went to the Temple and looked around---the Greek word means assessed, as in a kind of reconnaissance. But then he withdrew to the village of Bethany because the hour was late. We wonder: what was the hour too late for?  The suspense is soon resolved. The following day, on Monday of Holy Week, Jesus returns to the Temple. And what comes next is a vivid description of a scene so important that it is one of a handful of events in Jesus life that is recorded in all four gospels. It also appears in three other independent sources, so we can be confident in the historicity of this scene.  Jesus and his disciples had staged their first action at the entrance to the Holy City; they stage the second at the entrance to the Holy Temple. They come into the Temples outer courtyard, called the Court of the Gentiles. This was a public space used for a number of things, both religious and practical. During this busy festival week, it would have been crowded with pilgrims and visitors, buyers and sellers, both Gentiles and Jews.  The courtyard was where Jewish pilgrims to Jerusalem could purchase salt, incense, wine and oil, as well as unblemished animals for sacrifice in the Temple: oxen, sheep, goats, pigeons, and doves. There were also stalls that offered other items for their convenience, and the tables of the money changers---not unlike the currency exchange places in our international airports today. In the Temple courtyard, the pilgrims who had streamed into the city for the celebration of Passover could obtain goods needed for worship and exchange their currency for the coinage needed to pay the Temple fees.  Suddenly, amidst the already bustling activity of this crowded courtyard, chaos erupts. Jesus and his friends are overturning the tables of the merchants and the money changers! They are releasing the goats and cattle, breaking open the cages of pigeons and doves. Coins are flying, sheep bleating, vendors shouting and scrambling after their money and merchandise. Startled pilgrims are stumbling over the scattered detritus. A stampede of frightened animals, chased by their owners, rushes out of the Temple gates and into the choked streets of Jerusalem.  And now Jesus and his disciples block the entrance to the courtyard, forbidding anyone carrying goods for sale or trade from entering the Temple. Its a kind of barricade, a guerilla ban on further business for the day. As you would expect, Roman guards and heavily armed Temple police immediately rush into the courtyard, looking for whoever is responsible for this mayhem. And there stands Jesus, breathing hard. My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations, he says, but you have made it a den of robbers.  What is going on here? It is obviously another pre-planned demonstration of prophetic criticism. But what exactly are Jesus and his disciples protesting?  This biblical scene is sometimes referred to as the cleansing of the Temple, but thats a misnomer, really. We might imagine, for instance, that they are protesting the sacrifice of innocent animals in the Temple---which does strike me as pretty repugnant. But blood sacrifice was common in the ancient world, intended as the offering of a sacred meal and a gift to God. It was also commanded in the Torah. There is no indication here or anywhere else that Jesus categorically rejected it.  We might similarly imagine that Jesus is denouncing Judaism as a religion, or priesthood as an institution, or commercial activity on the Temple grounds. But no. Jesus was a devout Jew all his life. He never questioned the legitimacy of priesthood. And the buying and selling going on in the area outside the worship space was entirely normal and practical, as unobjectionable as Girl Scouts selling cookies in the Wesley Room during coffee hour. Nobody in the courtyard was stealing or defrauding anyone, or contaminating the sacred precincts of the Temple.  So what is Jesus demonstrating against? Last week we saw that the key to understanding his entry into Jerusalem riding on a donkey is found in the ancient prophecy of Zechariah, which Jesus was intentionally enacting for the crowds. In the same way, his overturning the tables in the Temple courtyard now invokes the words of the Hebrew prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah. He quotes them outright when confronted by the Roman soldiers and Temple guards: My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nationsbut you have made it a den of robbers.  What is at stake here is the integrity of the Temple itself, and its faithfulness to God.  On the one hand, the Temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and devotion. While Jews believed that God was everywhere, the Temple was the holiest of all holy places, the house in which God dwelled as in no other. When they worshipped in the Temple, they stood in the real presence of God. And they knew themselves to be purified, forgiven, and blessed.  Theres no question that in the 1st Century, Jews from all over the Mediterranean world looked to the Jerusalem Temple with affection and pride. They supported it through taxation---an annual amount from every Jewish male over a certain age---and through pilgrimage, especially for religious celebrations like Passover. The prophet Isaiah had called the Temple a house of prayer for all nations because it was the place from which Gods Light was meant to shine on all nations, illuminating the pathway to justice and peace.  On the other hand, in the time of Jesus, the Temple had also become the center through which Rome administered its rule. In every place throughout the Empire, Rome governed through local intermediaries, usually the wealthy aristocracy that was already in place. In Judea, Rome assigned this task to the Temple authorities, who are referred to in Marks gospel as the chief priest, the elders, and the scribes.  While Jewish law called for the succession of priests through certain families and for life, these Temple priests were now appointed by Rome, richly rewarded, and replaced frequently. They were given a relatively free hand over their subjects, as long as they made sure that the annual tribute to Rome was collected and paid---an enormous burden on the mostly peasant population, amounting to 20% of all production. This required the seizing of ancestral lands and the imposition of huge debts, the records of which were storedin the Temple. At the same time, the Temple authorities were also supposed to maintain domestic peace and order.  It was a difficult task, and a delicate balancing act. The Temple authorities needed to collaborate enough with Rome to keep Rome happy, but not so much as to anger their Jewish subjects. But how could they be loyal to both Rome and their own people? As scholars Borg and Crossan put it, There was a terrible ambiguity in that the priest who represented the Jews before God on the Day of Atonement also represented them before Rome the rest of the year.i  And was this Temple the House of Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, or the House of Jupiter? The Temple priests walked a fine line, trying to hold them both together, preaching that Yahweh must have ordained the current social and political order. But when the symbol of the Empire, a golden eagle, was placed by the Romans atop one of Temple gates, and Jewish students tore it off because it was contrary to their sacred laws, they were summarily executed. Rome did not tolerate rival gods.  Enter Jesus, who knows that the Temple has become compromised beyond recognition. He turns over the tables of the money-changers, drives out the buyers and sellers, releases the animals being held for sacrifice. He and his disciples block the entrance to the Temple, symbolically---if not actually---shutting down its operations. When the police come for him, Jesus underscores his action by quoting the Hebrew prophet Isaiah: My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations. To which he adds a line from the prophet Jeremiah: but you have made it a den of robbers.  Notice that a den of robbers is not usually a place where robbery is going on. Its the hideout, the refuge, to which robbers flee for safety when the spoils have been taken elsewhere. The Temple authorities are not to imagine that the practice of worship gives them a cover for their crimes, a safe haven from divine justice. Listen to the rest of the passage in Jeremiah, from which Jesus is quoting:  Only, God says, if you amend your ways and your doings, if you truly act justly one with another, if you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, and the widow, will God continue to dwell with you in the Temple. Otherwise, warns God, I will do to the house that is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and your ancestors, just what I did to Shiloh. In other words, the great temple in Jerusalem will be destroyed, just as was the older i Marcus J. Borg & John Dominic Crossan, The Last Week: The Day-by-Day Account of Jesus Final Week in Jerusalem (San Francisco: HarperCollins, 2006) p. 41. For reading in tandem with this sermon, see Chapter 2. shrine. And in fact, Mark is writing this gospel forty years after the life of Jesus, around the year 70, when the temple in Jerusalem is destroyed, torn down by Roman legions.  Its a sober warning. What does all this mean for us, Christians living within another Empire, in a later age? Here are a few questions for us to consider:  What happens when a temple, or a church, becomes so culturally captive that there is no longer any recognizable difference between it and the structures of power in its surrounding society? When, as Jesus puts it, the salt has lost its taste, its power to transform?  What happens to pastors who become so afraid of offending one or another constituency, and so fearful that someone will get mad and take their money and leave, that we avoid anything that might be controversial and tone down the gospels critique of all societies and all empires?  Is the Kingdom of God our driving passion, as it was for Jesus? Is Gods demand for political, economic and social justice at the top of our list of religious concerns? Or are we looking to worship to be our safe haven from such demands?  When we go to a regional gathering of United Methodists, and everything that happens there is about our own institutional survival, programs and pressures for church growth and material success at all cost, have we forgotten our reason for being? Should our institution survive?  If our church here in Edmonds burned down tomorrow, who would miss us? Would it be those who are hungry, lonely, outcast, grieving, sick, or poor? Oh, I hope so.  What is at stake here---no less than it was for the Jerusalem Temple in the time of Jesus--- is our integrity as a church, and our faithfulness to God.  Amen.         "
031515tx,"The Need for a Traitor 4th Sunday in Lent at EUMC 3-15-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Zech. 11:12-14 & Mark 14:1-2, 10-11, 43-45  As we continue our Lenten journey through the last week of Jesus life, today we come to the Wednesday of that Holy Week.  On Sunday, you remember, Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey in a parody of the military parade that Pilate was leading on the other side of the city. It was a kind of street theater protesting the Roman Empires domination of the Hebrew people, enforced by violence.  On Monday, Jesus and his disciples staged another demonstration, overturning the tables of the moneychangers and blocking an entrance to the Jerusalem temple. This was an extension of the first protest, aimed now at the local religious authorities and their collaboration with Rome.  On Tuesday, as our guest preacher pointed out last week, Jesus verbally sparred with those local religious authorities, who are referred to in Marks gospel as the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes. He accused them of corruption and warned of the coming destruction of the temple.  Each day in Holy Week has brought intensifying conflict between Jesus and the reigning powers in his society: the Roman Empire with its army of occupation, and the local religious authorities who administer---and profit from---Roman rule. Now we come to Wednesday, and the plot takes a turn. As Mark tells us, Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray [Jesus] to them.  Who was this Judas? We actually have only scant information about him, especially in Marks gospel, which was the earliest of the four gospels and so closest to these events. We know that Judas was the son of Simon Iscariot, and that he was one of the original twelve disciples of Jesus. We know that he was a disciple in good standing during most of Jesus ministry, apparently trusted enough by the others to be appointed treasurer of the group.  Mark now tells us that Judas offers his services to the local authorities in Jerusalem, and strikes a deal. On Thursday of Holy Week, during the Passover meal, Jesus will declare that one of his friends will betray him. Later that night, in the Garden of Gethsemane, Judas will appear and kiss Jesus on the cheek as a way of identifying him to the temple police, who arrest Jesus and take him away.  And thats the last we hear about Judas in Marks gospel, although his absence is conspicuous when, a few chapters later, Mark relates that the resurrected Jesus appeared to the eleven disciples, not twelve. Later gospels add additional details, casting Judas in a more and more negative light as time goes on. John, for instance, claims that Judas was a thief who stole from the disciples common purse. Matthew tells us that after betraying Jesus, Judas was filled with remorse, went away, and hanged himself from a tree.  Through the subsequent two thousand years of Christian history, Judas has been vilified as the obvious villain of the gospel story, the tool of the devil, even the personification of evil. The very term Judas has entered many languages, including English, as a synonym for traitor. Philosophers and theologians have argued about Judas: didnt he have to do what he did in order for Gods plan to unfold? Was he predestined, then, to betray Jesus? Or did he make the choice himself?  In recent centuries, it has become popular to speculate about Judas motives for the betrayal. Perhaps, it is said, he had become disillusioned. Hed expected Jesus to lead a different kind of revolution against Rome, and he couldnt understand why Jesus was now talking about suffering and death. Or perhaps Judas had become convinced that nonviolent resistance wouldnt work, and was foolish. Or perhaps he expected that Jesus would be arrested, and hoped to save himself. Most recently its been suggested that Judas must have loved Jesus more deeply than the other disciples did, and so his dashed dreams were particularly intense. He acted out of anger and pain.  But we dont really know what was going on with Judas. We dont know the complexities of his life and personality, or why he did what he did. And Mark, the first gospel writer, has little interest in such things (let alone in theological arguments about things like predestination). Mark gives us only the barest facts about Judas, who is just one of the characters in his story. What Mark is focused on is the big picture here, the whole unfolding drama of Holy Week.  So lets back up and look at this text again. Mark tells us that : The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill himThen Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray [Jesus] to them. When they heard it, they were greatly pleased, and promised to give him money. (Notice that Mark doesnt say that Judas did it for money, just that they promised him some.)  Heres a question: why do the chief priests need Judas? Jesus has already done plenty of things warranting arrest and execution: he has publicly challenged the Roman Empire and its local administrators. Rome had certainly executed people for less, as we have seen. And Jesus doesnt have rights to anything like what we would call due process, the rights that a Roman citizen would have. If hes making trouble for the authorities, why dont they just pick him up and get rid of him?  Jesus poses this same question when the soldiers come for him in Gethsemane: Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me. Why was it necessary to arrest Jesus with the help of a traitor among his followers?  Go back to Sunday, when Jesus entered Jerusalem on a donkey, hailed by an enthusiastic crowd. Then Monday, when he called the temple a den of robbers and Mark says, When the chief priests and scribes heard it, they kept looking for a way to kill him, because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching. And again Tuesday, when Jesus bested and embarrassed the priests in public debate, and Mark tells us that a large crowd was listening to him with delight.  The chief priests and scribes, who have been assigned the task of administering Roman oppression while also maintaining domestic peace, are afraid of the crowds! They dont want an uprising on their hands. Mark says: The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him; for they said, Not during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people. They dont want a riot, or the predictable Roman response to riots. And they surely dont want either the excitable crowds or the Roman soldiers turning on them.  Its too risky, they decide. So they wont arrest Jesus. And then, on Wednesday: Judas appears. And he offers to do their dirty work for them! Hell take armed guards to where Jesus is and identify him, in a place away from the crowds and under cover of night. As Mark tells us, the chief priests and scribes are greatly pleased! They offer to reward Judas with thirty pieces of silver. Because now they can dispose of Jesus. And now, in Judas Iscariot, the crowds will have someone else to blame.  Blame is such a seductive thing, isnt it? And so powerful! When we are the ones doing the blaming, there is this wonderful, cleansing discharge of anger and emotion. And if we are guilty or implicated in any way, if we can get the crowds to blame someone else, that gets us out of the line of fire. Safely asleep in our beds while Judas leads the guards to Gethsemane, we can take comfort in the thought that someone else is clearly more worthy of blame than we are. With a little effort, we might even convince ourselves that we are, in fact, blameless.  It is so easy to allow blame to be fixed on one obvious evildoer, while deflecting attention away from ourselves. Take ISIS, for instance, an obvious evil in our time. ISIS is a Judas to the whole world community. And its cruelties can seem incomprehensible to us. Those people are nothing like us in the civilized world, we think, and we are nothing like them. But that kind of purifying, self-righteous anger burns on both sides.  What if, like Mark, we were to resist the temptation to demonize one party, back up, and look at the bigger picture? What if we were to dare ask, for instance: why does a segment of the worlds population---mostly recruited from among the most marginalized, impoverished, and desperate sectors---regard Western Civilization as the Evil Empire? Refusing to see any way at all in which we might be participating in creating conditions that breed extremism, we may feel safe from accusation, but also helpless to do anything about the situation. We just want our enemies to be eliminated. They want the same thing. And the violence continues.  This week in the news we saw those Oklahoma University students chanting racial slurs. Its tempting, isnt it, to blame those young people and call for them to be punished, without ever asking questions like: from whom did they get such ideas, and in what context could they come to imagine that such behavior is acceptable? Racism, classism, sexism, heterosexism---none of these exists in a vacuum. If we cant bear to consider what may be our part in condoning or perpetuating social evil, we cant then choose to modify our attitudes and actions, and so participate in social change.  Closest to home, perhaps, is the temptation to focus on assigning blame in our personal relationships. A relationship falls apart: lets say our marriage ends in divorce. How pleased we are, like those chief priests and scribes, if we can point to our former spouse as the Judas who did something public and reprehensible. Maybe they had an affair, or an addiction, or maybe they were abusive---and so we allow or even encourage family and friends to condemn them. Not just to hold them accountable for their behavior, which is appropriate, but to shade over into wholesale blaming and shaming.  We may sit in the office of a marriage counselor and volley accusations back and forth, like balls in a tennis match: youre at fault, not me, youre at fault, not me. Preoccupation with blame---and trying to avoid being blamed---is a ruthless game! The thing is: if we cant, at some point, rise above the tennis court and consider the whole game---if we cant allow ourselves to consider how we have participated in this relationship, consciously or unconsciously---we are likely to replicate its same dynamics in our next relationship.  That is to say: without what Christianity traditionally has called confession and repentance, we cant learn from our mistakes, change the one person we can change, and choose to do things differently in the future.  In his telling of the last week of Jesus life, Mark wants us to look at the big picture, without undue focus on Judas as the bad guy in this story. Fixating on blame and shame doesnt lead to anything good. It leads to a dead end in which violence is often intensified and the possibility for new life is ruled out. Look at where being consumed with self-blame, perhaps the most toxic blame of all, gets Judas in the end.  Here is where I notice that in the telling of this tale, this gospel writer doesnt vilify any one party. In fact, he emphasizes the interweaving of our lives when he repeatedly refers to Judas as Judas-one-of-the-twelve, Judas-one-of-the-twelve, almost like a title. Mark is reminding us that we are in this life together, and all of us contribute to the systems and relationships of which we are a part. Judas may be the most obvious traitor in the gospels, but before this story is over, every one of the twelve disciples will have betrayed Jesus.  So back up even further, considering the whole gospel, which is about multiple human failings, yes, but even more about the faithfulness of God. That whole tennis court, all the conflicts and machinations of that last week in Jesus life, this whole aching world, and all the faults and failures in your life and mine, are held within something even bigger: the compassionate love of God. As the story continues to unfold, Jesus will embody that life-giving love in the most breathtaking way. While dying on the cross, he wont be blaming anyone: not the chief priests and scribes, not Judas and the other disciples, not even his own executioners. Father, forgive them, he says, they know not what they do.  Lets call off the blame game. For sake of our own healing and the healing of the world, lets resist the temptation to demonize anyone. With courage and humility and without despair, let us confess our own sins, that we might become more and more able to take responsibility for our lives, and less and less inclined to focus on the sins of others. Let us commend ourselves, our loved ones, our friends, and yes, our enemies, to the greater mercy of God.  Amen.    "
032215tx,"A Last Supper and Gethsemane 5th Sunday in Lent 3-22-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James at EUMC text: Mark 14:12-52  It is now Thursday of the last week of Jesus life. The events leading up to his impending arrest have taken place: his highly visible entrance into Jerusalem, his overturning of the tables in the temple, and his verbal sparring with the local religious authorities. Those authorities now have him targeted. And Judas is just waiting for an opportunity to betray him.  Jesus is fully conscious of the inflammatory nature of his activities. He knows the precariousness of his situation. The disciples feel it, too. As we come to the fifth day of this Holy Week, the narrative of Marks gospel is heavy with a sense of gathering gloom.  Thursday is the beginning of Passover, and our text opens with the disciples asking Jesus, Where do you want us to go and make preparations for the Passover meal? In an echo of Palm Sunday, Jesus sends two of them ahead to secure what is needed, saying: Go into the city, where a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him, and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, The Teacher asks, Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples? He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.  Those preparations would have included buying a lamb in the temple courts, having it killed and its blood poured out on the altar as a sacrifice to God. Then the lamb would be roasted---there were ovens set up all around the temple grounds for this purpose---and brought back to the borrowed house in which Jesus and the disciples would eat the Passover meal.  We are reminded of two things in these preparations. One is the need for secrecy: Jesus sends two disciples to make these arrangements, thus withholding from Judas the precise location of the house. Now Judas cant tell the authorities where to find Jesus during the meal. Secondly, we are reminded once again that Jesus and his disciples were poor. They have no home, and little money. They must rely on the hospitality of strangers even for this Last Supper.  As they enter the upper room, there is a pitcher and bowl beside the door, but no servant on hand---as there would be in a more affluent home---to wash the disciples feet. Normal practice was to enter a room, remove your sandals, and have a servant kneel at your feet and rinse off the dust and grime. It was impolite to come to the table wearing shoes. In the gospel of John, which offers a much longer account of Holy Thursday, none of the disciples wants to take on the role of a servant and carry out this menial task. But Jesus takes the pitcher and basin, kneels, and starts in. It is a humbling, mortifying, teaching moment.  As weve seen, however, Mark is the shortest as well as the earliest of the four gospels. Without any mention of foot-washing, Mark cuts straight to the meal at the table. Now, when we imagine this scene, we are likely to picture something like da Vincis famous painting of the Last Supper. But in the time of Jesus, a formal meal was not eaten at a dining table with chairs. It was eaten at a u-shaped table, low to the ground, called a triclinium, around which diners were seated on cushions. And the head of the table was not at the center of the U, as we might expect, but on the left leg of the U, where the host of meal would sit, with just enough room for one honored guest to sit at his right, and one on his left.  So picture this: Jesus is now seated on that short left leg of the U. Like all the disciples, he has his legs turned to the side and his feet behind him, so that he leans his weight on his left hand. His right hand is thus freed for eating with. There are no utensils; the meal would be eaten with pieces of bread, dipped into a common dish.  Mark tells us, And when they had taken their places and were eating, Jesus said, I tell you, one of you will betray me, one who isdipping bread into the bowl with me. Stricken, the disciples say to him, one after another, Surely, not I? We, the readers, know that its Judas, who is sitting---ironically---just to the left of Jesus, in a place of honor. But the disciples dont know who the betrayer is. They look around at each other in mounting distress and distrust.  It is at this tense moment that Jesus enacts a gesture that will become symbolic of the entirety of his teaching, and will be ritually re-enacted by his followers for all generations to come. Its a gesture both simple and utterly profound. He reaches out for the bread on the table, offers the traditional prayer of blessing, but then he departs from the ritual of the Passover meal. Or more accurately, he adds another layer of meaning to it. He breaks the bread, and holds it out to his friends, saying, Take, eat; this is my body, given for you.  Then he takes a cup, and after giving thanks, he offers it to them. In a Passover meal, the ritual words would be said, after which each participant would sip from his own cup. Instead, Jesus now has his disciples share in one cup, passing it from hand to hand. This is my blood, he tells them, which is poured out for many. Truly I tell you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.  What is Jesus doing here? The interpretive key of this gesture is at the end of his sentence, when he speaks of the kingdom of God. Remember that this phrase is a shorthand term, as Marcus Borg puts it, for what life would be like on earth if God were king, and the rulers of this world were not. The kingdom of God means this world as God intends it to be: people living in peace with one another, and in harmony with all creation.  The kingdom of God was the great passion of Jesus life. Everything he did was to teach and demonstrate its qualities, and to invite others to join him in living it into being. For whenever people love and serve one another, the kingdom of God is already here in part. One day it will come in all its fullness, when human beings finally get it, and Gods will is done on earth as it is in heaven. Life on this planet will flourish! Children will grow up safe and free; the lion will lie down with the lamb; there will be no suffering or sorrow any more.  What Jesus is doing now in the upper room encapsulates his teachings about the kingdom of God. Like all enduring rituals, it has multiple layers of meaning. At the most primal level, it has the meanings that humans have always associated with shared meals. Nourishment, sustenance, abundance. The gathering of family and clan, sharing not only food but life together. Hospitality extended to friends, strangers, and even enemies: for the end of hostility is signaled when weapons are set aside and people sit down to eat a common meal. For three years now, Jesus has been telling stories and parables in which meals exemplify life in the kingdom of God. Hes told of a high holy party thrown by a joyful father upon the return of a prodigal son. Hes talked about a wedding banquet to which everyone---including the poor, brought in from the streets in their ragged clothes---is invited.  In his society, there were strict rules about who could eat with whom. Jesus demonstrated life in the kingdom of God by breaking those rules. He would eat, laugh and drink wine with anyone, including those viewed by his society as undesirable and unclean. He ate with prostitutes, with people of other religions, even with Jews who betrayed their own people by collecting taxes for Rome! Theologians point out that an analogy close to our own time would be a religious leader in the American South prior to the civil rights movement holding public integrated meals and declaring, This is the kingdom of God---and the divided world that you see around you is not.i  In this meal in the upper room there is also the echo of Jesus feeding the multitudes. Recall that he didnt conjure up loaves and fishes out of thin air, but asked the disciples to start with what they had, and distribute it to the crowd. In case we should miss it, the same four actions are repeated now, and the same verbs are used: Jesus takes the bread, blesses it, breaks it, and gives it to his disciples. We cant miss the implication that life in Gods kingdom includes gratitude, generosity, and justice: the fair distribution of what is needed to sustain life.  And again, this is a Passover meal, which is already rich in meaning. In the Passover meal, Jews told and retold the central story of their faith, the holy story of how God had liberated them from slavery and oppression. This story defined and constituted them as a people. In the Passover meal, in the time of Jesus and today, symbolic foods are eaten to bring the past into the present, and the story is remembered in such a way as to make it ones own. When Jews eat the Passover meal, they are saying: this is what God has done not only for our ancestors but for us, and this is who we are. We are the people of God, liberated that we might live in such a way as to demonstrate Gods good purposes for the world.  In the upper room, Jesus doesnt erase that story or that identity, but he does a radical thing. He adds yet another layer of meaning for his disciples when he says, over the unleavened Passover bread, This is my body, given for you. And over the wine, This is my lifeblood, poured out for you. Suddenly, the sense of impending tragedy that has hovered over this meal is brought fully forward. Jesus is speaking of what they are all silently anticipating with fear and dread.  Because his teachings and actions run counter to what is normal in the Roman Empire, Jesus is rightly viewed by the authorities as subversive to the prevailing order, although wrongly accused of planning to overthrow it by armed rebellion. Because of his emphasis on all the themes in this holy meal---including breaking down the dividing walls between insiders and outsiders, and eliminating a social order in which a few people at the top dominate a whole lot of people at the bottom---his life is going to be violently taken from him.  So Jesus departs from the Passover ritual by having his disciples all share in one communal cup. Earlier James and John had asked him for seats of honor in his coming kingdom, and Jesus had asked, Are you able to drink the cup that I drink? That is to say, are you able to commit your lives fully to the kingdom of God, and pour yourselves out in loving service?  The verbs used by Mark reveal that the ritual of this meal will take place literally in Jesus body, and must be internalized in all who would follow him and belong to his community. If we are to be his people, we too must: take the cup (take hold of our lives); give thanks (give thanks with our lives); and pour ourselves out (sharing our lives and resources, and devoting ourselves to the well-being of all people and all creation). This is the new covenant proclaimed, prayed, offered to God, and made holy.  But reality is revealed in this ritual. This is a demanding, costly way of life. Do the disciples who have drunk of this one cup understand what they are being initiated into? Probably not. But the early Christians for whom Mark is writing this gospel, who are experiencing violent persecution at the hands of the Roman Empire in the year 70, definitely do.  Which leads to one other layer of meaning in this meal. Jesus looks around the table, and sees that his disciples are confused and afraid, and already dazed by anticipatory grief. And he knows that they will soon desert him. When the soldiers come, every one of them will run away. But Jesus forgives them. Its not even a question. He loves them. He wants only to give them solace and strength.  And so he gives them the gift of this ritual with the promise that whenever they repeat it, he will be with them. This meal in the upper room is for disciples who fall short, who dont quite know who Jesus is for them, who arent sure they can follow him, who will try and fail multiple times. This meal is for us.  The dinner comes to an end. The oil lamps are extinguished. The disciples rise to their feet and follow Jesus down the stairs of the house. They walk in silence down the hill through the Kidron Valley, past its ancient tombs. It is midnight. They walk toward a place at the base of the Mount of Olives, a place where the leaves on the olive trees glimmer, like silver coins, in the moonlight.  A place called Gethsemane.  Amen.       i Marcus J.Borg & John Dominic Crossan, The Last Week: The Day-by-Day Account of Jesus Final Week in Jerusalem (San Francisco: HarperCollins, 2006) p. 114  "
032915tx,"Who Killed Jesus? Palm/Passion Sunday at EUMC 4-29-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Isaiah 53:1-5 & Mark 15:1-15  For five Sundays, we have been following the unfolding events of the last week of Jesus life. The week began with his vivid entrance into Jerusalem riding on a donkey, on what we celebrate today as Palm Sunday.  On Monday, Jesus and his disciples overturned the tables of the moneychangers in the Temple. As we have seen, the actions of both Sunday and Monday were forms of protest against the violence of the Roman Empire, and against the local religious authorities who collaborated with Rome in oppressing the Hebrew people.  On Tuesday, Jesus debated with those authorities, known in Marks gospel as the chief priests and scribes. On Wednesday, Judas offered to deliver Jesus into their hands. Thursday brought a series of events: the Last Supper, the prayer in Gethsemane, the Judas kiss, the arrest of Jesus, the disciples running away. Throughout the night Jesus was interrogated by a privy council of the chief priests and scribes. He was charged with blasphemy, for which the penalty under Jewish law was death.  But under Roman law, the priests and scribes had no authority to execute prisoners. So when dawn breaks on Friday morning, Jesus is brought to the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate. The chief priests, scribes, and a crowd of their supporters loudly call for Jesus to be executed. Pilate has no interest in their charge of religious blasphemy, but he does pay attention when Jesus is accused of stirring up rebellion against Roman rule.  Pilate then offers the crowd a choice: either Jesus or Barabbas, another political prisoner, will be set free as a kind of gift on this Jewish festival of Passover. The crowd calls for Barabbas to go free. Hence Jesus is sentenced to death, and handed over to Roman soldiers to be crucified.  Crucifixion was a particularly gruesome form of execution, reserved for the punishment of political crimes: treason, rebellion, and sedition. It was intended to be not only retribution but a public warning, a deterrent to others who might want to plot against the Roman Empire. For that reason crucifixions began with public humiliation and torture. Jesus is subjected to nakedness, spitting, and taunting, as well as beating and flogging.  He is then forced to carry the instrument of his own execution through the city streets. Because crucifixions were meant to terrify the population, they were carried out in very visible places: at crossroads, in theaters, or on high ground. The political prisoner, already weak from torture, was nailed to a cross, hoisted up for public view, and left to die. The corpse was almost always left where it hung, to be eaten by dogs or picked clean by birds of prey. The bones would then be thrown onto a heap of trash, which is how the place of Jesus crucifixion got its name: Golgotha, which means the place of skulls.  Jesus dies in this horrific way. His suffering and death are known as his passion. Hence Palm Sunday is also called Passion Sunday. All of which raises an important question. Who was responsible for this terrible turn of events? Who killed Jesus? The chief priests and scribes had a hand in it. These were the local leaders assigned the task of administering Roman rule. They were to keep money flowing through the Temple to their Roman overlords while also maintaining domestic peace. The concern of these leaders is fairly stated in the gospel of John: If we let [Jesus] go on like this, everyone will believe him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation.i Caiaphas, the high priest, offers the practical argument that it is better to let one man die than that the whole nation perish.ii  But we have to be careful in asserting that these Jewish authorities were partly responsible for the death of Jesus. Yes, they turned him over to Pilate, and employed a crowd to call for his execution. But it would be false to make a blanket statement that the Jews killed Jesus. Jesus was a Jew! His mother was a Jew, as were his disciples, and the women who stayed with him to the end. Nicodemus, who spoke up for him in his Jewish trial, and Joseph of Arimathea, who provided a tomb for his burial, were Jews. The crowds who hailed his entry into Jerusalem, and delighted in his challenge to the chief priests and elders, were Jewish crowds.  Subsequent centuries of Christian persecution of Jews, based on the charge that Jews are Christ-killers, means that we need to make this clear distinction. Hitler, as you may know, loved the famous Passion Play in Oberammergau, Germany, which emphasizes Jewish involvement in the death of Jesus. But it was not the Jews as a people who called for Jesus to be executed. It was their leaders at that time, who were appointed by Rome to serve the domination system of the Roman Empire.  And here we might pause for a word about this term, domination system. Its a term used by biblical scholars---and I would refer you especially to Walter Brueggemann,iii probably the foremost Old Testament scholar of our time. Domination systems were developed about 5000 years ago, and were the most common form of social organization in the ancient world, including the empires of Egypt, Assyria, and Babylonia. Domination systems had five main characteristics:  First, they were politically oppressive. They were generally ruled by a monarchy or small aristocracy, and ordinary people had little or no say about how they were governed. Second, they were economically exploitative. A ruling elite structured the economic system so that 1% of the population would get roughly two-thirds of the societys annual production.  A third characteristic of ancient domination systems is that they were profoundly patriarchal. A few men ruled over all other men, and over all women and children. Fourth: they were legitimated, or justified, with religious language. The people were told that those in power ruled by divine right, and that the social order reflected the will of God. And fifth: domination systems were expanded through wars, and enforced by violence and the threat of violence.  The prevailing domination system in the time of Jesus was the Roman Empire. Thus the chief priests and scribes brought Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor. Pilate knew that Jesus was not a violent threat, or he would have rounded up and executed his closest followers. But Pilate also understood that Jesus was advocating for something he called the kingdom of God, in subversive opposition to the kingdom of Rome. So: he was to be eliminated. The reality is that Jesus was officially, legally, and publicly executed by Roman authority. Jewish leaders called for his death, but Jesus was sentenced by the Roman governor, tortured and killed by Roman soldiers, and died on a Roman cross.  But again, this is not to make a blanket statement that the Romans killed Jesus. It was a Roman centurion, in fact, who was first to acknowledge, Truly, this was the Son of God! Most Roman citizens knew that this sort of thing happened, but were not directly involved. And the ones who were involved in the crucifixion of Jesus probably thought that they were just doing their jobs.  Its important for us to realize that the execution of Jesus was nothing unusual in ancient times. It was simply normal behavior on the part of domination systems. Moreover, as empires go, Rome was better than most. There is no reason to think that either the temple authorities or the Roman officials and soldiers were particularly wicked individuals.  This was just how domination systems responded to those who openly and vigorously challenged them. It was how things were done, how things had always been done. It has happened throughout history. One could make a good case that in somewhat different form, domination systems---and the lethal machinery that keeps them going---remain with us today.  In this sense, no one person was responsible for the execution of Jesus. And in the same sense, most everyone who participated in the prevailing domination system, or benefitted from it in any way, was responsible. Did you happen to see the recent Academy Award-winning movie, Selma? One of the scenes in that movie depicts Martin Luther King, Jr. speaking at the funeral of a young black man who was killed by white riot police. In that real-life eulogy, King asked, Who killed Jimmy Lee Johnson? Then he went on:  A State trooper pointed the gun, but he did not act alone. He was murdered by the brutality of every sheriff who practices lawlessness in the name of law. He was murdered by the irresponsibility of every politician, from governors on down, who has fed his constituents on prejudice and hatred. He was murdered by the timidity of a federal government that can spend millions of dollars a day to keep troops in South Vietnam and cannot protect the rights of its own citizens seeking the right to vote. He was murdered by the indifference of every white minister of the gospel who has remained silent behind the safe security of stained-glass windows. And he was murdered by the cowardice of every Negro who passively accepts the evils of segregation and stands on the sidelines in the struggle for justice.iv  King was making the point that there is a degree to which we all participate in and contribute to the systems of which we are part. Some more than others, especially those with more rather than less decision-making power. But in a real sense, everyone who was part of the domination system of the Roman Empire had a role in killing Jesus. The world killed Jesus. It continues to crucify Jesus today.  Perhaps you have seen Rembrandts famous painting of the crucifixion. When you look at that painting your eyes are first drawn to the cross on which Jesus is dying. Then your attention travels to the crowd gathered at the foot of the cross. And then, if you look closely, you see that theres someone else standing in the shadow, off at the edge of the painting. It is Rembrandt himself. Hes painted himself into the scene.  Rembrandt was confessing that in own life, and in his own ways, he helped to crucify Jesus. He sided with those who opposed the kingdom of God because it threatened their personal and political interests. He joined the crowds who were fascinated by the spectacle of violence, and the Roman citizens who felt powerless to do anything but look the other way. He joined Judas in betraying Jesus, and Peter, who denied knowing him. He had participated in the suffering of innocents. Rembrandts painting invites us to contemplate how that might be true for us, as well.  Who killed Jesus? We all do. We still do. And how does God respond? Is God King of the ultimate Domination System? Is God like a Roman Emperor who demands obedience, and decrees suffering and death for all who oppose Gods will? Is God pleased, appeased, or satisfied by violence committed in Gods name? You might hear that some time, even in church. But dont believe it. That kind of theology is an example of religion being used to legitimate and perpetuate our own human domination systems.  We Christians believe that Jesus was a person who was transparently one with God. In him we see what God is like. Jesus was passionately committed to witnessing to the Kingdom of God, the reign of justice and peace on earth, which is the opposite of a domination system. He would never abandon his mission. But neither would he would destroy his enemies by violence. He would seek to win our hearts in a different way.  A pastor named Steve Garnaas-Holmes has written a poem about this. Let me close by sharing it with you:  This is a story of love, not a deal, no scheme to save us with someone else's blood, no holy slaughter, no means, no demand. It's not God's choice that a savior suffer: that's ours alone. This is the story of our evil and God's invasion of love. The Gentle One comes among us, our certainty, our betrayal, our violence, and offers only love. He invites to dinner those who will deny him, offers the place of honor to the one who will betray him, offers us himself.

040515tx,"Practicing Resurrection a sermon for Easter Sunday at EUMC 4-5-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Deuteronomy 30:11-19 & Mark 16:1-8  For six Sundays, weve been following the story of the last week in Jesus life, as recorded in the gospel of Mark. Now this morning we come to Marks account of the resurrection. And I have to tell you: its strange!  For one thing, Marks version of what happened on Easter morning is incredibly short. You know how long hes been telling us about the last week of Jesus life? For 253 verses. Thats five chapters, a third of the whole gospel. Now we come to his account of the resurrection, which presumably is the climax of the story, and we get only eight short verses.  And then, abruptly, the narrative stops. The women come to the tomb, find it empty, and they are told, Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.  Mark says: So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. And thats it. Thats the end. In the original Greek of Marks gospel, this last line isnt even a complete sentence! It breaks off in the middle of a phrase.  What kind of ending is this? It seems nonsensical: if the women ran away and never said anything to anyone, how did we get this story? But if you look in your Bible, youll find a footnote that says, Earliest manuscripts end at verse 8. That is, in the oldest manuscripts of the Bible that we have, Marks gospel ends---I wont say concludes but ends---right here, with the women running away from the empty tomb.  Its a strange ending. The fathers of the early church thought so, too. They said: Mark must have written a longer ending, but its now missing. Were talking about papyrus scrolls, after all. The last chapter could have been torn off, or worn off. So they tacked on a summary of what the other three gospels say about the resurrection, because they thought thats how Mark must have meant to tell this story.  In fact, they added two endings. The first brings Peter back into the story, closing with Amen. Later they added yet another, even longer ending. It puts Mary Magdalene back in the picture, along with the eleven disciples and the resurrected Jesus speaking to them at length, after which Jesus ascends to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God. Now theres an ending! And they finished off that one, too with the word Amen.  But what I want us to consider this morning is that Mark did end his gospel at the eighth verse, with the women running away from the empty tomb. Assuming that the original ending is as intentional and finely crafted as the rest of his gospel, Mark is telling us something about Easter through this strange non-ending. So lets look at it.  Its Sunday, the first day of the week. The sun is just rising, casting its glow on the pinkish stones of Jerusalem. Three women---Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome---are walking along the road.  On Friday, they had watched Jesus, their beloved Teacher and friend, die. Theyd followed as his body was taken down from the cross and carried to the cemetery. There had been no time for washing and anointing. The battered corpse was just wrapped in a cloth and hurriedly placed in a tomb, which was sealed with a stone. Nothing more could be done on the Sabbath, which went from sundown Friday til sundown Saturday. The women prepared the oils and spices that would be needed, and waited through the darkness of Saturday night.  On Sunday morning, as soon as its light enough to see, they leave the house with their bundles. As they walk, they wonder aloud: when they reach the tomb, how are they going to roll away the stone? Its too heavy. They could have stayed away, given the apparent impossibility of the task. But no. As writer Joan Chittister says about the life of faith, its not a matter of doing great things, its a matter of doing small things courageously.i  Mark, the storyteller, brings us into the story. We see the fingers of dawn reaching through the olive trees. We hear the women talking. They approach the tomb and see that the stone has already been moved. Someone must have been there before them. Someone might be in there now! They enter the tomb cautiously. As their eyes adjust to the dark, they see a young man dressed in a white robe sitting beside the place where the body had been laid.  The man says to them: You are looking for Jesus, the one who was crucified. He is risen. He is not here. See for yourself. The women look and see that the body is gone. Where is it? Has someone taken it? They are already on that vulnerable edge, after the events of the past few days. The man---who is he? Has Mark, the gospel writer, written himself into this story?---continues. Go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is gone before you to Galilee, and you will see him there.  The women stare at him. What? What is he talking about? This is all too strange. They back out of the tomb, then turn and start running, for terror and amazement had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. And this is where Mark ends his gospel. Only it doesnt sound like an ending. The women run away from the disturbing young man, away from the shockingly empty tomb... and thats it? But what happens next?  We, the readers, know how stories are supposed to end. The conflict is resolved. The good guys win, the bad guys lose. Add an Amen and youve finished the story. Or its like a drama on TV. The story got bad there for awhile, even pretty tense there at the tomb, but with a few additions everythings OK now. Jesus is in his heaven and alls right with the world. Amen.  An ending gives you closure. You can close the book, or turn off the TV, and relax. You can believe the ending or not: its a good story either way. And its over. But Marks story doesnt sound like its over. Have you heard of the principle of Ockhams razor? It says that the answer to a puzzling question is usually the simplest. Maybe Marks gospel seems unfinished becauseit is unfinished. Maybe Mark is telling us that the story of Easter isnt over. Listen again to what the man in white says: Go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is gone before you to Galilee, and you will see him there. Go: not an intellectual proposition to be accepted, but an action to be taken. Tell his disciples: who? Is he talking about all who would be followers of Jesus? And Peter: oh, great. Mark has to put that in.  The last time we saw Peter in Marks gospel, he was trying to save himself by denying that he knew Jesus. Now Mark, the man of few words, could have just said go and tell the disciples---Peter was one of the disciples. But no, he singles him out by name. Peter: the one who loved Jesus so much, and failed him so miserably. And get this: the Greek conjunction here is kai, but kai can mean and or even. So this line can also be read as, Go and tell the disciples, even Peter, the one who needs to hear this most, that Jesus is gone before you to Galilee.  We know what Galilee signifies. Galilee was home to the disciples. They were all Galileans. Galilee was where Jesus first called them to follow him. It was where they had experienced the intensity of their first commitment, where their ministry began and flourished, before they came to Jerusalem and things fell apart. Is Mark saying that the work that was begun in Galilee isnt, in fact, over? That there is still work to be done?  And then this: there you will see him, just as he told you. That is: Jesus isnt here, in the place of the dead. Go home to your families and communities, and live as his disciples. Make his passion for the Kingdom of God your passion. Take up the work of loving God and neighbor as he taught and demonstrated. In the process of carrying on his ministry, you will discover that you are accompanied by a Living Presence. There you will see him, just as he told you.  I think of Albert Schweitzer, one of the heroes of the last century. You may remember that Schweitzer was a brilliant organist, philosopher, physician, and theologian. At some point he decided that he would pursue his own many interests until the age of thirty, after which he would repay the world something for all the happiness it had given to him. Taking Jesus as his model, he dedicated the rest of his life to serving humanity as a doctor in Africa.  Schweitzer writes about Jesus as an enigmatic figure who goes before us, leading us toward the fulfillment of life. But, Schweitzer said, he is always just out of our reach. We cant grasp him. We cant domesticate him. And we cant just give intellectual assent to propositions about him. What is required is not belief, but participation. Jesus turns a corner, and we glimpse a flash of color, just the hem of his robe. All we can do is try to follow him, or not. But if we do, in that process---not beforehand, not in the abstract, but in that process---we come to know him. Albert Schweitzer wrote a book called The Quest for the Historical Jesus. It ends with these lines:  He comes to us as One unknown, without a name, as of old, by the lakeside, he came to those who knew Him not. He speaks to us the same words: Follow me! and sets us to the tasks which He has to fulfill for our time.And to those who obey, whether they be wise or simple, He will reveal himself in the toils, the conflicts, the sufferings which they pass through in His fellowship, and, as an ineffable mystery, they shall learn in their own experience Who He is.ii  i Joan Chittister, For Everything a Season (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1995, 2013) p. 2 ii Albert Schweitzer, The Quest of the Historical Jesus, translated by W. Montgomery (Great Britain: A & C Black, Ltd., first English ed. 1910) p. 403 Thats what happened to those first disciples. They went back to Galilee and took up their ministry. They lived in a distinctive way: welcoming everyone, sharing resources, caring for each other, loving even their enemies, and serving the wider world. They became known as the People of the Way, the way of Jesus Christ. And in that process, an amazing thing happened. Those ordinary, flawed disciples---even Peter---discovered that they werent alone. Christ was with them.  And so they lived with a remarkable, irrepressible joy. In a Roman Empire that had grown fatalistic about life, these Christians did strange things. They rejoiced in inappropriate places, like prison cells. Or at the wrong times, like at funerals. They were the kind of people who, after receiving a diagnosis of cancer, go out and plant a tree. Or who, having failed at love or lost a loved one, choose to love and laugh and live again. They said, We know that nothing, not even death, can separate us from the love of God. They didnt just intellectually accept the concept of resurrection: they practiced it.  Thats what Mark is doing in the original ending of his gospel. Were reading along, drawn into the story, there with the women at the empty tomb, running out into the sunlight, back into the world. Suddenly the narrative breaks off, and its future is thrust into our hands. Suddenly we are characters in the story we are reading! What happens next? What will we do? Theres no closure on the Jesus story because we are invited into his continuing life.  So I guess I cant end this sermon with an Amen. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is gone before you to Galilee, and you will see him there.            "
042615tx_1,"Embracing Forgiveness II: How to Forgive? a sermon at EUMC 4-26-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Matthew 18:15-22 & II Corinthians 2:5-11  A distraught couple sits in their pastors study. They explain that one of them has been involved in an extramarital affair. The affair is over now, but the pain is not.  The husband says, I love my wife, and I dont want a divorce. But every time I think of her affair---every time I hear of anyone having an affair now, even in the movies, even on TV---I feel sick to my stomach. I dont know if I will ever be able to trust her again. I know the answer lies in forgiveness, but how can I forgive? The mans wife, sitting beside him awash in tears, asks an even harder question: How can I forgive myself?  A woman sits in a career counselors office, having been laid off at her job after thirty years of loyal service. She is fifty-nine years old. The counselor tells her that her anger against her former employer is hurting no one but herself, and is getting in the way of her search for a new job. The woman exclaims, I cant even sleep at night, after the way I was treated! You expect me to just forget it and go on?  We live in a world in which people regularly hurt one another. Injustices are committed. Pain is inflicted, often upon those who are most innocent and vulnerable. Every one of us, at some point in our lives, will be walked on or taken advantage of---betrayed by someone we trust, disappointed by someone we love. We will be hurt by others. At such times, the Christian faith calls for forgiveness.  We know that Jesus taught and demonstrated forgiveness. He called for loving ones enemies, turning the other cheek, and walking the extra mile. If we are to be his followers, we must learn to practice forgiveness. We also know that forgiveness is commanded primarily for our own sake, not for the sake of those who have hurt us. Those who hurt us may, or may not, be transformed by our forgiveness. But forgiveness is what we need to do in order to be able to find peace.  We may know all this, but still the question remains: how do we forgive? Last week we began this series by considering the question, Why forgive? Today we move to the practical question of How to Forgive? And as we begin, I invite you to consider the ways you have been hurt in life---the people and events that you need to forgive.  Of course, not every single hurt you have sustained over the years is a big deal. If every name you were ever called, every test you failed, or every disappointment you ever experienced still affected you deeply, you would be too paralyzed by pain to get out of bed in the morning. On the other hand, you can probably think of at least one hurt you have received in life that you still hold onto, or that still has a hold on you.  When someone brings up a topic related to your wound---betrayal or bullying or whatever it was that hurt you---you bristle and cringe. Or when the name of a particular person comes up, the wound is reopened. Youve been hurt, and you are still bleeding. To some extent, your woundedness diminishes your life and limits your freedom. You want to be free of this burden. Where do you start?  Turn to our text for this morning. The part of the text that is most quoted comes at the end, where Peter asks Jesus, If someone sins against me, how often do I have to forgive? As many as seven times? Jesus answers, Not seven times, but seventy times seven. That is to say: Forgiveness isnt a one-time, once-and-for all activity. It is a process, much like the human processes of grief or physical healing. And like grief or healing, forgiveness has its own timing, and its own pace.  That means we cant expect to wake up one morning and think, OK, todays the day Im going to forgive someone who hurt me, and then blithely do it. What we can do is begin wherever we are, even if it is only to say, I dont forgive the person who hurt me. I dont even want to forgive him. But I want to move in the direction of healing. With that, we have taken a step forward. God will bless that step, and increase it. Forgiveness is a process that cant be forced, but only embraced, day by day by day.  Well, then, what are the steps of that process? And how do we embrace them? In real life, the process doesnt move in a straight line. Healing may happen in fits and starts, and no two people experience forgiveness in exactly the same way. But turn back to our text again. Just before the well-known verses about forgiving seventy times seven there is another passage, less often quoted, about how to forgive. Lets look at it this morning.  First this. If another member of the church sins against you, go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone.  There is an assumption embedded in this instruction. It has to do with what might be called claiming and naming the hurt. Claiming the hurt is the opposite of denial. That is, when we are injured, a natural reaction is often to minimize what has happened. We say, She didnt fire me. I quit, or we tell the person who has hurt us, It doesnt bother me. Denial is especially natural when a pain is fresh and severe, just as shock is a natural reaction when we receive a physical injury.  But emotional wounds, like physical ones, cannot be ignored without consequences. A cut that is band-aided over when it really needs thorough medical attention can fester. In the same way, emotional wounds that we pass over, carrying on as if nothing happened, may cause recurrent pain and may never properly heal.  Claiming the hurt is hard work, however. No one really wants to claim something that is painful. But this first step of forgiveness cannot be bypassed. We have to acknowledge the situation as honestly as we can, as in, I was a neglected child, or This is an abusive relationship. We might come to God in prayer, for example, and say, I was criticized unjustly and humiliated at my job. At first I felt numb. Now Im beginning to feel incredibly angry. Im going to need some real help with this, God.  It requires courage to let yourself remember, know, and appreciate the gravity of a hurt that has been inflicted on you. For more serious hurts you may need to find a therapist who will safely guide you through this part of the process. But somehow---perhaps in prayer, or with a trusted friend---we have to recognize the extent of our injuries. We have to see what they have done to our trust, our sense of justice, and our self-worth. Only then can we go to the person who has hurt us, and confront them with the situation.  Our text continues. If the member listens to you, you have regained that one. But if you are not listened to, take one or two others along with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses.  The process of forgiveness continues with the seeking of justice. We all know that there are at least two sides to every story. So the next step of forgiveness is a communal process of discovering and determining responsibility for what has happened. The process involves fact-finding and filtering: What exactly went on? How did it occur? It also involves weighing the evidence on the responsibility scale: Who had power in the relationship? And who was most vulnerable?  I once counseled a woman who had been sexually assaulted many years before. It had been a violent attack by a total stranger. But years later, this woman was still asking herself: What could I have done to avoid this? What did I do to provoke it? If I had just been somewhere else that day, this would not have happened. Why didnt I see it coming? Should I have struggled more? Did I deserve what happened to me?  It is important that we look squarely at the hurts we have received and ask ourselves what role we played in them, so that we can take responsibility for what is ours. Next Sunday we will look more closely at the subject of self-forgiveness. But you can see how self-blame can spiral out of control and personal responsibility can be exaggerated beyond reason. If we think we are responsible for everything and everyone, even things that are truly beyond our control, we will become perfectionists and ultimately defeated people.  So there ought to be a communal process of determining facts and responsibility. And it may happen that in this process, the person or persons who are at fault will own up to it, and insofar as possible, try to make amends. There may be acts of restitution that can occur. There may be genuine repentance and change. There may even be restoration of relationships, and reunion of all parties.  But what happens if the person or persons who are at fault take no responsibility? Or if what was taken away can never be made right? The stranger who attacked the woman I counseled was never caught. Justice was never done. The person who caused your hurt may never acknowledge it, may downplay or even deny it. What then? What do you do?  Our text goes on. If the member refuses to listen, tell it to the church; and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church, let such a one be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. In other words, leave vengeance to God, and let it go. Shake the dust from your feet, and move on. This may be the hardest part of forgiveness. For it requires, among other thing, letting go of victimhood. A natural part of the process of forgiveness is that we come to see ourselves as victims---for in fact, we are. We have been hurt, unjustly. The problem comes when we then go through life always expecting the worst, or repeating the past. When this happens, we are sinking into a mire of helplessness. The victim part of who we are becomes the largest part of our identity, and victim becomes not just what happened to us, but who we are.  We all know people who are stuck in this mire. Most of us have been there ourselves a time or two. One step toward moving out of perpetual victimhood is to join a support group in which we can discover that our hurts are not unique, that there are others who understand what we have been through, and that there are similarly wounded people who are moving on with their lives.  We can also fight victimhood by focusing on our gifts, our strengths, and the blessings in our lives. We can refuse to be perpetual victims. We can allow our pain to teach us compassion for others. We can even channel our anger and outrage into positive action for change. And we can remember that no matter how badly we have been hurt, each of us is more than the wounds we have received.  Which brings us to integration, the goal of this process of forgiveness. With tears, prayer, and time, we can finally recognize that although we were hurt, we did, in fact, survive. Our painful experiences took something from us, but gave us things as well. We are finally able to put the injury into perspective, neither dwelling on it nor forgetting it, but seeing it for what it is: a part of who we are, but not all of who we are.  We might even become able to see, at this point, that, just as we are more than victims, the person who injured us is more than a victimizer. He or she is a weak, fallible human being, like ourselves, with his or her own history, sorrows, and needs. Now we can let that person go, and release the power they have held over us---even if they arent sorry, even if they are long gone. We might even be able to wish them well. We are at peace.  This process of forgiveness is not linear: we may need to return several times to certain stages, and it may take a long time for us to experience its fullness and completeness. And this process isnt easy: it may be the hardest work we ever do.  But the great thing is: we dont do this work alone. The process of forgiveness isnt something we create: its more like a flowing river that bears us up and carries us along. It is the work of God, who is utterly devoted to our healing and growth. We can trust that, and lean into it.  Through the process of forgiveness, we can allow the love of God to make us whole.  Amen.   "
050315tx,"Embracing Forgiveness III: Forgiven Much, Love Much EUMC 4-26-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Luke 7:36-47 & Ephesians 4:25-32  Lets begin with our gospel scene for today. We are at a dinner party thrown by a Pharisee, whose guests are prominent in the community. At the center of this meal is Jesus, the young prophet who everyone is talking about.  The host, whose name is Simon, is somewhat cool toward Jesus. We dont know why. But Simon doesnt embrace Jesus when he arrives. He doesnt call for a servant to come and wash Jesus feet, or to anoint his hands and feet with olive oil. That is to say: Simon neglects the common courtesies, in his culture, of a host toward a respected guest.  The party is underway when---unexpectedly---a woman appears in the room. The woman is not identified by name; were told only that she is a sinner. Given that the word sinner is variously used in Lukes gospel, we need not assume that she was a prostitute, as if thats the only sin of which a woman was capable in the 1st century. But we can assume that whatever shes done, the others who are present---including Simon---know about it. And they are offended by her presence among them.  Their dismay is soon amplified by the womans behavior---which is outrageous according to the social etiquette of the time. For she lavishes attention upon Jesus. Jesus sits at a low table, his legs turned to the right and his feet behind him. The woman comes to stand behind him, weeping. Then she kneels down and washes his feet with her tears! She loosens her long hair and uses it as a towel. She anoints Jesus with precious, perfumed oil. She even kisses his feet---which was what you did, in Jewish custom, when someone had saved your life.  Apparently Jesus knows what has prompted this extravagant and public display of devotion. And he doesnt object. Simon, however, mutters under his breath, If this man were really a prophet, he would have known what kind of woman this is who is touching him. Its disgusting! Whereupon Jesus turns to Simon with a question that takes the form of a short parable.  Who do you think would be more grateful, Jesus asks, a man whose debt of five hundred denarii has been cancelled, or one who is forgiven fifty? A denarius was the value of a days wages, but you dont need to know that in order to do the math. The first man is forgiven ten times what the other man is. Simon answers, I supposeit would be the man for whom the greater debt was cancelled. We hear the intonation in his words, I suppose  But the obvious analogy is to the woman who has crashed this party. Apparently she has been forgiven much, perhaps ten times what others have been forgiven. Which explains why she is devoting herself to Jesus, and weeping as she does. Shes overcome by gratitude. She has been given her life back! Jesus says to Simon, You see this woman? You didnt give me the bare essentials of hospitality when I entered your house. But this woman washes my feet with her tears! Then Jesus adds these profound words: Whoever who has been forgiven much, loves much. But whoever has been forgiven little, loves little.  We are now in the third of our four-week series on forgiveness. We began with the question, Why Forgive? Last Sunday we looked at How to Forgive. And in response to those two sermons, some of you have written or spoken to me, saying, Its one thing to forgive other people. But how do we forgive ourselves? That can be even harder.  So lets look at that question today, in light of our gospel story. The woman in the scene is identified only as a sinner, someone who has committed an unspecified wrong---or wrongs. But whatever shes done, she has received forgiveness. And she has allowed herself to receive it, which is another way of saying that she has forgiven herself. She has let forgiveness in and allowed it to redefine her; she has been restored to life! And it is so beautiful that it breaks her heart, and all she can do is express her gratitude.  Last week we looked at the steps that are involved in the process of forgiving others. This morning lets look at those same steps as they apply to forgiving ourselves.i We might remember, at the outset, that forgiveness is a process. Depending on the seriousness of the hurts we have inflicted, it may take a long time, and prayer, and tears. It may need to be repeated more than once. And in the process of receiving forgiveness, we may need to seek the help of others: a pastor or priest, a therapist, or trusted friends.  As you might guess, the first step in forgiveness is recognizing our need for it. The woman at the dinner party knows she needed forgiveness; Simon, the host, believes he does not. This first step is sometimes called claiming and naming the hurt. And were not talking now about confessing our sinfulness as human beings in a general way, but about specific ways that we ourselves have wronged or harmed others. Perhaps, as we walk through these steps, you may want to bring to your mind something that you know you need forgiveness for.  Be as specific as possible, in the privacy of your own mind, here before God. No one else is going to know what you are thinking! And name just one thing: we cant usually receive forgiveness for more than one thing at a time. You might say, for instance, I lied to someone who trusted me. Or, I chose to drink and drive that night. Or, I gossiped about a friend. Or, I turned away from someone who needed and deserved my help.  These are the kind of things that pierce us with honest judgments against ourselves. And the more decent we are, the more acutely we are likely to feel the unfair hurts we have caused others. We dont have to be bad people to do bad things. If only bad people did bad things to others, we would live in a pretty good world.  It takes courage to claim and name a hurt we have inflicted. We might write it down, or confess it to one other person, to keep from sliding backward into denying or minimizing what we have done. But lets say we have named something, and weve allowed ourselves to see the extent of the damage we have caused. Unless it would cause additional and unfair hurt to do so, the next step is to go to the person or persons we have wronged and apologize: honestly and sincerely, without making excuses for ourselves. And if there is any way to undo the harm weve done, or to make amends for it, we do that, as well.  Now, forgiveness means release from the burden of the past, not freedom from responsibility. The consequences of our behavior remain. And we arent entitled to forgiveness just because we apologize and try to make amends. We have no right to demand forgiveness, or to insist on reconciliation. If the person weve harmed does give us the gift of forgiveness, thats what it is: a gift, to be received with gratitude and joy. And we may allow their forgiveness to give us permission to forgive ourselves.  But what if the person weve harmed cant, or isnt ready to, forgive? What if they slam the door in our face? Our only option, at that point, is to go to God. We can continue in prayer for the healing of that person, and turn to God to help us with this process. For whether or not forgiveness is given by the one weve harmed, God still welcomes us to the blessedness and dignity of children of God. God can give us the permission and power to forgive ourselves, even if the person weve wronged does not.  Now we come to the stage called integration, which includes seeking to understand ourselves so that we can learn from our mistakes. In Gods loving presence, we can ask hard questions like: What hurt us so deeply that we needed to hurt others? What power possessed us and made us feel helpless to do otherwise? What ignorance made us think we acted righteously? We ask these so that we might do differently in the future than we have done in the past. Our question is not whether we did a hurtful thing. We did. The question is whether that event should be allowed to define who we are, and determine the rest of our life.  Sometimes quickly, but more often slowly, Gods forgiveness comes to us, like sunlight filtering through the leaves of a dark forest. The split between our own internal judger and the one being judged is gradually healed. Its a process, remember! But with the cleansed vision of forgiveness, we no longer let our former self curse the person we are now becoming.  We still acknowledge the injury we caused, but we also see ourselves anew through Gods eyes, with kindness and compassion. We see our potential for good, the light that shines at our deepest core. It was God who said, Let light shine out of darkness, and who continues to create and re-create us. It is Christ who says to the woman at the party, and says to us with authority: Your sins are forgiven. In humility, we receive that gift. We allow ourselves to trust in Gods grace and mercy, and go forward with our lives.  A word of caution is in order, however, which is why our text from Lukes gospel is such a good one for today. You may be like the woman at the party: no longer focused on your guilt and unworthiness, now forgiven and set free. But you need to remember that there are plenty of self-righteous people in the world who dont want you to forgive yourself. They are the Simons of the world, who want you to punish yourself, and keep on punishing. They want you to wear a red letter of perpetual shame on your chest, and never take it off.  I understand the Simons of the world. I can be one of them. There is something in me---is there in you, too?---that wants a wrongdoer to keep a low profile, speak with a meek voice, and grovel a little. Maybe a lot. But I also know how pinched and tight and shut down it is to be like Simon. Your heart contracted, disdainful, proud. And inwardly as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else. I tell you, its no way to live. Whoever is forgiven little, loves little. i I am especially indebted this morning to two classic books on the process of forgiveness by Lewis Smedes: Forgive and Forget: Healing the Hurts We Dont Deserve (New York: Pocket Books, Simon & Schuster, 1984) and The Art of Forgiving (Nashville, Tennessee: Random House, 1996). I also consulted many other sources, and the same themes appear in most of them! These are the two books I most highly recommend. So when you act like a person who has forgiven yourself, happy and at ease in your own skin in spite of your past, expect consternation from the self-righteous crowd. Youll need courage to face the Simons in your life! While you experience healing and release, they may feel irritable and suspicious; too many rules are being broken by all this freedom! They may be resentful, or even hostile. And they will probably want you to change back to the way you used to be.  But dont do it. You know how you will know when you have forgiven yourself? Its like driving on a highway and reaching the top of a long hill. You may not be exactly sure when you have reached level ground, but you can tell that you have passed the top when the car suddenly surges forward. When you have allowed yourself to receive the gift of forgiveness, you experience a burst of spontaneous, generous love for other people.  Your heart expands. You may do something impulsive, like send roses to the woman who wont forgive you. She may toss them in the trash---which is OK with you! You throw your arms around a friend youve never touched before. You call up your Dad and tell him that you love him. You give a handful of twenties to a homeless stranger. You do something extravagant that the practical part of yourself thinks is nutty. You celebrate the miracle of forgiveness!  So go ahead, and be overcome by gratitude. Weep with the joy of it; let down your hair! Kneel at Christs feet and offer your gifts. Let Gods forgiveness flow through you, and emerge from you as unbounded love for others. For it is as Jesus said:  Whoever is forgiven much, loves much.  Amen.                  "
051015tx,"Embracing Forgiveness IV: No Matter What a sermon on Mothers Day 5-10-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James at EUMC texts: Isaiah 49:8-15 & Acts 17:22-28  Among the ancient Hebrews, the center of religious life was the great Temple in Jerusalem. In the heart of the Temple was a small curtained-off room called the Holy of Holies. The Hebrews believed that Gods presence abided in that place in an exceptionally powerful way. In the Book of Exodus, God promises, There I will meet you.i  Within the Holy of Holies stood the ark of the covenant, a rectangular box containing the scrolls of the Torah, Gods holy law. And on top of the ark lay a slab of gold called the mercy seat. This was believed to be the seat of Gods presence on earth.  On one day a year the High Priest of the Temple would enter the Holy of Holies and there, behind the curtain, pray to God on behalf of the people. The priest sprinkled the blood of a perfect animal seven times as a sign of Gods forgiveness and mercy toward the whole nation. The Hebrews believed that forgiveness radiated from the mercy seat in the heart of the Temple outward, into the hearts and lives of all the people of God.  In the Book of Revelation, at the end of the Bible, John tells of how an angel showed him Gods throne, and from that golden seat flowed a crystal-bright river of life. That stream nourishes the tree of life that will bring about the healing of the nations.ii These vivid images appear in some of our most beloved hymns, as in streams of mercy, never ceasing, and shall we gather at the riverthat flows by the throne of God.  From beginning to end, our Bible celebrates the forgiveness and mercy of God. Gods loving power emanates from a golden mercy seat. Forgiveness and mercy are poured out on this world in an ever-flowing, healing stream. What does it mean, this beautiful biblical word mercy? Lets look at it today.  There are several words in the Bible that are translated into English as mercy, but this morning I want to focus on one in particular: the Hebrew word rachamim. In its singular form, rechem, this word literally means womb or uterus. When expressed in plural form, rachamim, the word takes on a more figurative meaning: mercy, or womb-love, meaning a love like that of a mother for the child in her womb.  Now you see why I saved this aspect of forgiveness for today, which also happens to be Mothers Day! The biblical concept of mercy includes forgiveness, but is bigger and richer, as its root meaning suggests.  Suppose you were reading along in your Bible, and whenever you came across the English word, mercy, you saw womb-love instead---which you do, in the original Hebrew. You would read in the Psalms, for instance, that Gods mercy (read womb-love or mother love) fills all the earth. Gods love surrounds and embraces this world. We humans exist on earth like children in Gods womb, suspended in an environment perfectly calibrated to support our life. In todays text from the Book of acts, the apostle Paul speaks of God as the One in whom we live and move and have our being. When do we live and move and have our being within someone else, except as infants in our mothers womb?  Awhile back I came across a cartoon that pictures twin babies floating in the waters of a womb. The two siblings are already arguing, as theyll probably be doing for the rest of their lives. One is saying, There is a mother; I know it. I sense her presence all around us. The other says, If there were a mother, why would she be so elusive? You have no proof; you just believe whatever you want to believe. The joke is that like us, even as they are surrounded by the One on whom their lives depend, the children perceive their Mother only dimly, and argue over whether she exists at all.  What is our scripture saying when it speaks of the womb-love of God?  To begin with, the metaphor suggests an extraordinary intimacy between God and human beings, an intimacy so close that we actually have a shared life. It suggests that God isnt some distant and uninvolved Creator who set the universe in motion and then went away and let it run. God is more like a Mother whose own life is intimately and dynamically bound up with the life of the child she carries within her own body.  Mercy, then, has something to do with closeness and connection. To have mercy for another person is almost to get inside their skin, or to have them get inside yours---to feel what they feel, to be affected by what affects them. How many times have you heard a parent say, I wish it were me who was sick or suffering, instead of my child. It would be easier. This quality of identifying so fully with another that you feel their sorrows and joys as your own is one facet of what the Bible means by mercy.  Here is a further dimension. Where rachamim appears in the Bible, again and again it is in the context of the assertion that God loves Gods children--human beings--no matter what---no matter what we do, what we believe, whether we are good or bad, whether we love God in return, or not.  Not long ago I was talking with one of my oldest friends. We knew each other in college; we were bridesmaids in each others weddings; we coached each other through the births of our children. We were reminiscing about all that and my friend said, You know, it wasnt until I became a mother myself that I began to understand my own mothers love for me. You hold this baby in your arms and suddenly, effortlessly, you love them. And you want nothing more desperately than for them to have a good life.  She went on, Then they become teenagers. You find yourself looking at this young person who is challenging you and you think: I am still your parent and you are still my child, no matter what. Even if you reject everything I stand for. Even if you dye your hair purple and pierce tender parts of your body. Even if you hate me and say awful things to me. Even if you run away from home, even if you break my heartI will never stop longing to see you again. I am your mother. No matter what you do or where you go, I will always love you.  Our Bible is the story of a people who repeatedly turn away from God. But Gods mercy still flows to them without ceasing. In Isaiah, God says to the Hebrews, Can a woman forget her sucking baby, that she should have no mercy on the child of her womb? Even these may forget, but I will not forget you. In Jeremiah, God anguishes over Israel, which has abandoned its faith, and God says, Is Ephraim my dear son? My darling child? my womb trembles for him; I will truly show mercy upon him.  In English we often equate the word mercy with forgiveness. Rachamim does include forgiveness, but in a particular form. In your usual form of human forgiveness, one person agrees to put behind them the wrong done by another, and go forward. Mercy, however, never counted the wrong in the first place. One who is merciful may grieve and suffer over wrongs committed by another, but never regards those wrongs as a stumbling block to relationship.  In other words, the hand of mercy is always extended. It has no desire to condemn, or eagerness to take offense. When offense is given, it does not withdraw the outstretched hand. This is why the Psalms speak of Gods mercy as everlasting. Its the sort of forgiveness that is perpetual, as referred to in the quotation at the top of your bulletin today, from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: Forgiveness is not an occasional act. It is a permanent attitude.  Mercy is the rain that falls on the just and the unjust alike. Its the love of the father who looks out the window and waits for his prodigal son to come home. Its the truth of Gods own being. God simply loves us, always and forever, no matter what. Gods mercy flows through life in this world as an indiscriminate, unconditional, ever-flowing stream.  Which brings us to another element of mercy, not to be overlooked. That is: like the womb of a human mother, mercy surrounds but does not possess. It sustains, but does not control.  As a pastor, I often meet with people who are angry at God. They say, If God is all-powerful and all-good, why is there so much evil in the world? Or maybe theyre going through something difficult or tragic or unfair. In bewilderment and anger, they ask, Why is God allowing this terrible thing to happen to me?  At such times I recall a thin little book by Leslie Weatherhead, written in 1944, at the end of World War II. The book (which I highly recommend) is called The Will of God. Weatherhead was the pastor of a London church. He asked: why do we speak as if everything that happens in this world is Gods will? If thats true, then God is arbitrary and cruel, even sadistic.  Weatherhead says: but we are wrong to think of God as a king sitting on a high throne, looking down and controlling everything that happens on earth, pulling the puppet strings or pulling the levers, saying, OK, this person will die of cancer, but that one will survive. I will give your child a long and happy life. But I decree that your child will starve, and yours will be maimed by a roadside bomb, and yours bitten by a mosquito carrying malaria. What would be the difference, in that case, between God and Satan?  In the midst of Londons post-war rubble, Weatherhead writes:  i Exodus 25:22 ii Rev. 22:1-2 by our confusion we thrust peoples minds into unbelievable torment; we blunt the edge of social purpose until they mutter the slogan, Gods will be done, when the very opposite of Gods will is being done!  In that same book, Weatherhead uses an image that has stayed with me. He says: We would do better to picture Gods power as a stream flowing down a hill. We humans have the freedom and the power to divert the stream: like children with buckets and spades, we can dig ditches and build dams. We can choose to do evil and defy Gods will. For God will not coerce or control. God has forever renounced force over us.  Even so, Weatherhead says, all of that water will make it to the sea. Gods will may be temporarily thwarted, in which case the water has to find another route around or through the obstacles placed before it. So we can trust that Gods loving purposes will ultimately prevail. In this sense, God is all-powerful. Gods mercy persists. So, for example, Weatherhead says: Gods will was for human beings to follow Jesus, not to murder him! But since thats what people did, Gods will was accomplished another way. The cross itself became a means by which people were drawn to follow Christ.  Do you see what this does to our anger over the evil and sorrow in this world? We still feel it, but God feels it with us. And we can stop blaming God. We might even be able to forgive God for not being the sort of God we imagined. The biblical concept of God reigning from the mercy seatnot removed and high up but in the midst of the people--- means that God isnt making bad things happen to good people. When bad things do happen, God suffers with us, sustains us, and persists in bringing about healing, redemption, goodness and life.  And finally this. Like a human parent, God wants us to grow up into the full strength and dignity of adult children of God, and to work alongside God in this world.  The apostle Paul wrote to the early Christians, Do you not know that you are Gods temple and that Gods Spirit dwells in you?...Gods temple is holy, and you are that temple.iii Paul was saying that the Holy of Holies was not just located in Jerusalem, but isin us! Within each one of us shines the pure gold of the mercy seat. There I will meet you, God says.  Or to use Weatherheads imagery: We humans can grow up, and choose to serve Gods will, rather than thwart it. When we work for justice and peace, when we live with compassion, when we practice forgiveness and mercy, the love of God flows in us and through us. Its a crystal-bright, healing stream.  So at the end of this series on forgiveness, here is what I want to say. Cling to the mercy seat. Allow Gods mercy for you and for all Gods children to flow through your life. Seek to love as God loves, and forgive as God forgives. And God will be with you , no matter what.  Amen.  iii I Cor. 3:16-17 "
051715tx,"God Is Still Speaking a sermon preached at EUMC 5-17-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Isaiah 43:15-19 & John 16:12-13  In the year 1620, a group of English Separatists, known today as the pilgrims, boarded a ship called the Mayflower. The 102 passengersmen, women, and children---had great hopes for a new life in the New World. There they would find liberty to follow God in the things that had been revealed to their own hearts and understanding.  A minister by the name of John Robinson, who himself stayed behind, sent the departing company off on their pilgrim voyage with these earnest words:   I charge you before Godthatif God reveals anything to you by any other instrument of His, be as ready to receive it as you were to receive any truth by my ministry, for I am verily persuaded the Lord hath more truth yet to break forth out of His Holy Word.i  Robinson was articulating a confidence in Gods real and ongoing presence in this world. Those early pilgrims believed in what is called, in theological language, continuous or ongoing revelation. That is, they believed that God didnt interact only with people in ancient, biblical times, and then go away or fall silent. Rather, as the modern-day descendents of the pilgrims, the United Church of Christ, puts it, God is still speaking.ii  Our Bible, too, points to a God who is continually interacting with people. When Moses asks Gods name, God refuses to be boxed in, answering I am who I am, or I will be who I will be. Who I am will be revealed as we go along, in a genuine relationship that unfolds over time. With Abraham, we learn that God is perpetually casting out the suggestion that we go on an adventure of faith, into new and unknown territory.  In our first reading for this morning, from the prophet Isaiah, God says, I am about to do a new thing. God is a Spirit that does new things in this world. In todays gospel reading, Jesus tells his disciples, I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, it will guide you into all the truth, and declare to you the things that are to come. The moving of the Spirit will lead you into the next phase of Gods blessing.  In the 4th Century after Jesus, a series of Councils decided on what is called the canon of the Bible, the fixed number of books that constitute the Bible we have today. But even that was a process that didnt happen all at once. And even in closing the canon, the Councils were assuming that Gods Spirit was leading them to do so! Centuries after the time of Christ, God was still speaking!  In other words, the canon of the Bible is closed because it contains enough, not because God is enclosed within its pages, or because God has already said everything there is to say. Today, in any other field of life, we wouldnt let a Council of 4th Century scholars tell us what to read and what to believe! We wouldnt try to freeze truth at some point in the past, and assume that there was nothing else for us to experience or to learn.  An ever-present danger in Christian history is that people stop at one reform or another and say, Ah, now weve got it, and then try to fix that understanding in stone for all time. There lies the way of ossification, or the fossilization of Western Christianity. But our religion was never meant to be a stop sign. Its a road sign. It points beyond itself to the Living God, and to the Kingdom of God that is the destination of the Christian life.  If God is alive and well and at work in this world, and Gods Spirit is still speaking to people today, an important question is: how do we listen for Gods voice, and discern that it is Gods? For especially in todays pluralistic world, many voices claim to be speaking for God. How do we distinguish Gods voice amidst all the other voices?  Lets say you have a decision to make. You ask, God, what is your will for my life? Shall I take that job? Shall I marry this person? In what direction are you urging me to go? Or lets say we have a question before us as a community of faith. We ask, God, how shall we order our life together? Shall we buy or sell this or that property? Start this or that new ministry? What is your will for us on contemporary issues like immigration? race relations? war?  Along with the United Church of Christ and many other denominations, we United Methodists believe that God is still speaking today. God is not silent on these questions. And as United Methodists, we have our own way of thinking about and describing how we go about discerning Gods voice. Some of you are long-time United Methodists and will recognize these general guidelines; for others they may be new. Lets lift them up today.  A first assumption that guides our listening for Gods voice is that it is a communal process. God may speak to us in the silences of our own heart and conscience, but our individual perceptions need to be tested in the context of Christian community.  For instance, an individual may feel called by God to become a pastor, but in the United Methodist Church, that calling needs to be ratified by the community. Our ordination process requires that the individual who feels called by God also undertake a series of steps through which others pray about it, ask questions, review demonstrated behavior, and affirm that yes, we see evidence that you have the gifts and graces for this particular ministry.  The community isnt always right, of course. Its subject to error, like all things human,. But overall, we probably have a better chance of discerning Gods will together than apart. Were like the blind men describing the elephant, each one describing what he sees and in danger of thinking its the whole thing: a trunk, a tail, a leg. When we confer together about the truth we each perceive, we create a more accurate picture than any of us could create alone.  This is why United Methodists hold so many conferences, at every level of our life together. Next Sunday we will have a Church Conference here in this congregation, to elect our leaders for the coming year. In June, some of us will attend the Annual Conference of United Methodists in the Pacific Northwest, made up of members from every local church who will confer---and pray, and yes, argue together---and so arrive at our best sense of how God is leading us to decide on the particular issues that come before us. In May of 2016, the General Conference of our whole denomination will be held in Portland, Oregon. This is the first time its ever been held in our part of the country. You might want to attend as a volunteer or an observer. General Conference, which meets every four years, is colorful and exciting. In Portland, about nine hundred representatives from United Methodist churches around the globe will ask how the Spirit of God is moving among us and speaking to us today. They will set our direction for the next four years.  Holy conferencing is a process of discernment that honors both majority and minority points of view. Its this communal process that has allowed our church to change over time, and so remain relevant in a changing world. Through the years, Methodists have grappled with---and changed our stance on---things like slavery, child labor, the ordination of women, and racial integration. Next years General Conference will be listening for Gods leading on issues ranging from poverty to homosexuality to climate change.  Our process of discernment is disciplined as well as democratic. Following the lead of John Wesley, Methodists have always held that if you want to discern Gods will, there are at least four reliable sources to consult. These four sources of revelation, sometimes called the Wesleyan quadrilateral, are: scripture, tradition, reason, and experience.  Scripture is the depository of a peoples consciousness of God, a record of past revelation. Its not the last word in our ongoing dialogue with God, but it is a living word through which God is still speaking today. In the pages of scripture, we meet a God who loves this world passionately, and who wills only the good; a God who is always on the side of human dignity and freedom; a God whose very essence is Love.  So, for example, in the Hebrew Bible, God revealed that slavery was wrong. Nevertheless, the Hebrews had slaves, although by ancient standards their system of slavery was unusually humane because it was shaped by the event of the Exodus. Only over time, as the Spirit interpreted the full significance of the Exodus, was slavery finally understood as radically wrong. Even in todays world, slavery appears in new forms, and Gods word on the subject needs to be heard again.  For Christians, the gospels are our canon within the canon, the authority by which everything else---including everything else in the Bible---is evaluated. Thus even within a set canon of the Bible, there is room for God to continue to reveal and refine its meaning over time. God continues to inspire amazing new understandings, even millennia later, through the Bible we have. In other words, God hath more light to break forth from [Gods] Holy Word. Tradition is the second side of the Wesleyan quadrilateral. This refers to our Christian heritage over the two thousand years since biblical times. If we are seeking to know Gods will, why not listen to the experience of other Christians who have gone before us? What did Hildegaard of Bingen learn, in her years of loving God? What about John Calvin, or C.S. Lewis, or Dorothy Day? Their spiritual struggles were not all that different from ours. If we want to hear God speaking, we ought to listen to the stories and collective wisdom of our tradition.  A third locus of revelation is reason. We are to love God with all our hearts, souls, and minds. United Methodists believe that God does not ask us to suspend our intellects, or check our minds at the door of the church! If you have a decision to make and you want to listen for Gods leading, ask some reasonable questions, like: What principles or values are at stake? What are your available options? What are the probable consequences of this or that course of action? And what do the best minds of our time---in science or medicine or psychology or theology---have to say about your particular question?  If you need one star to travel by, ask, What would Jesus do? Or perhaps, What does Love require? Or: Where is Love leading us now? As we grow toward the fullness of life in Gods Kingdom, some things that Christians used to do (the Salem witch hunts come to mind) simply dont reflect our present understanding of a compassionate, inclusive and loving God.  Which leads to the final place to listen to God speaking, and the fourth side of the quadrilateral: experience. Look back over your life and see if there are patterns you can identify. Pay attention to your dreams and your deepest intuition. Look for God in your own experiences of nature and human relationships. Become part of a ChristCare group here at church, in which you will find companions who will essentially ask you, week to week, How is it with your soul? With that kind of accountability, we all start to pay more attention to that still, small voice that speaks through our individual and communal life experiences.  This is a dynamic way to do theology! We bring a question or issue into the Wesleyan quadrilateral, and it swirls from corner to corner: scripture, tradition, reason, and experience, all in conversation with each other. And in the midst of this conversation, we discover that God is larger than what we thought we knew. As Jesus promised, the Spirit of truth comes. It opens us to what God is doing in the world, and how we can be part of it. God is still speaking.  Let me close with a prayer that comes from the Christian community of Ionaiii:  In the gift of this new day, in the gift of the present moment, in the gift of time and eternity intertwined, in the gifts of scripture and community and worship, Let us give thanks. Let us be attentive. Let us be open to fresh stirrings of the Spirit. Let us listen for the voice of God.  Amen.       i This can be found in any number of sources: see on line, for instance: http://www.newtestamentpattern.net/christian-articles/sundry-thoughts/the-words-of-john-robinson_mayflower/. Robinsons words are also included in the lyrics of a hymn that we are singing in todays service, We Limit Not the Truth of God. ii This is the current motto or slogan of the United Church of Christ, in which I grew up. It usually appears as it does on the top of our bulletin this morning, with a comma at the end, since the UCC advises: Never put a period where God has placed a comma. iii This is a modified version of a prayer that was offered by John Philip Newell as part of the Pilgrimage for Change in which I participated two summers ago, on the island of Iona.

052415tx,"A Murmuration of Starlings Pentecost Sunday at EUMC 5-24-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Acts 2:1-17, Gen. 8: 6-11 & Matt. 3:13-17  Along with many of you, Im sure, I like to listen to Garrison Keillor on the radio show, A Prairie Home Companion. He also comes on tour to Seattle from time to time, telling his stories about growing up in Lake Wobegone, Minnesota.  Religion in Lake Wobegone, as you may know, is mostly Lutheran, although there is a Catholic church there with the wonderful name, Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility. But its mostly the Lutherans that Keillor talks about. And many of us are attracted to his stories about them because, although its Lutherans hes talking about, in them we Methodists also recognize ourselves.  One of Keillors classic stories is especially appropriate for Pentecost.i He tells about a traveling evangelist who comes to Lake Wobegone with her gospel birds. Her parakeets re-enact the story of Noahs ark. They are all dressed up like animals: little elephants, tigers, and lions. They walk two-by-two up a little wooden plank into a miniature ark, while four parakeets play tiny bells to the words, I sing because Im happy, I sing because Im free, for his eye is on the sparrow, and I know he watches me.  Then the evangelist preaches, and concludes by saying, Now, with every eye closed and every head bowed Thats the set-up for the altar call. She says, With every eye closed and with every head bowedwill you just sit where you are now, and contemplate Gods great love for our lives. And when one of the birds lands on your shoulder, I want you, if you feel a blessing in your heart, to stand up right where you are.  Well, Lutherans are a lot like United Methodists. They are used to closing their eyes and bowing their heads, but they usually dont expect something dramatic to happen. Now they are being warned by this evangelist. When you bow your head and think about God, get ready for a visitation. Which made them very anxious and uncomfortable. But they closed their eyes and bowed their heads anyway, although some of them peeked.  I remind you of what Im sure Garrison Keillor knew when he wrote this story: that in religious imagery, the bird is a powerful symbol. The bird is a symbol of the Holy Spirit, Gods real presence in our midst. In Genesis, the Spirit hovers over the waters of creation like a dove. At his baptism in the River Jordan, Jesus sees the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. This same image is associated with the story of Pentecost in Acts 2, when Gods presence was experienced by the disciples in the Upper Room.  So here are these Lake Wobegone Lutherans, gathered not in the Upper Room, but in the church basement, waiting for the Holy Spirit to descend. They found, as they sat there, that thoughts of divine providence did come to their minds, thoughts of a great love that seemed to abide in the world, and that upheld and supported them.  As they sat and meditated on this, one by one each of them felt a slight weight on their shoulder, as if someone had gently tapped them. And one by one, they stood up, until everyone was standing. Keillor says, It was a stunning moment. Opening their eyes and looking around at one another, they were all amazed. And the thing was, they did feel blessed. They felt that they had been touched by God.  Keillor uses satire to get us to drop our guard, to show us that things we are accustomed to, things we think we have grown out of, even things we make fun of---all can be bearers of the presence of God in this world. It can happen anywhere: in small towns, in congregations of Norwegian farmers; or here, in our congregation, with all our endearing idiosyncrasies. The Spirit is present and can touch us, if we let it. And like the first disciples on Pentecost, we are blessed.  I love the term, gospel parakeets. In fact, there are lots of wonderful names for groups of birds: did you know that? A flock of rooks is called a parliament. There is a conspiracy of ravens, a pandemonium of parrots, and an ostentation of peacocks. Writers and birders speak of a murder of crows, a lamentation of swans, and a scold of jays. A group of vultures gathering round is called a wake. A group of hummingbirds is called a charm---I love that one. A charm of hummingbirds.  Then there is a chime of wrens, a prayer of godwits, and an exaltation of larks. Thats perfect, isnt it? I recently was in a coulee in eastern Washington where there seemed to be a meadowlark on every bush, throwing back its head and singing its heart out. The canyons rock walls---columnar basalt that looked like giant organ pipes---echoed and magnified the sound into a symphony of birdsong. It truly was an exaltation of larks!  And then theres the one that seems just right for today: a murmuration of starlings. Do you know the word, murmuration? It has two meanings. On one hand, it simply means the sound of murmuring---like in todays story of Pentecost, when the disciples in the Upper Room spontaneously start speaking in many different languages. Their voices rise and swell in a murmuration of sound.  The other meaning of murmuration also echoes the story of Pentecost. A murmuration of starlings is the gathering of starlings into a breathtakingly well-coordinated aerial ballet. European Starlings are a non-native but extremely common species in North America. Theyre sometimes called junk birds, meaning invasive pests that serve little purpose other than to dirty car windshields and destroy crops. But have you ever seen starlings mass over an open field, swirling and rising like swift black smoke?  Here is a short YouTube video of this phenomenon. It was recorded by kayakers on the River Shannon, in Ireland.  [Show video at https://vimeo.com/31158841. 2 min: 3seconds]   Beautiful, isnt it? The commonest of birds, each individual a nondescript speckled black, first congregate in an open space. Such congregations can be seen wherever there is open agricultural land, like up in the Skagit Valley. And I am grateful, this morning, to my friend and birding companion, Sally Balmer---who lives in Anacortes---for making the connection between Pentecost and a murmuration of starlings.  From their congregations in an open field, the starlings rise in flight. They start out in the groups theyve been feeding with all day, and slowly merge into bigger and denser flocks until they form an undulating mass of 10,000 birds or more. In the southwest of Denmark, murmurations of starlings in spring can number more than a million birds! Locals speak of their late-afternoon displays as black sun, because they literally darken the sky.  Its an amazing sight. Once formed, a murmuration of starlings---as the poet Richard Wilbur writes---rolls like a drunken fingerprint across the sky.ii Winging at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour, thousands of birds make hairpin turns that appear, to the unaided eye, to be done entirely in unison. Its a wonderful metaphor for the formation of the church on Pentecost. Individuals, but moving as a single entity. And behaving together in a way that should beimpossible.  The space between individual birds in a murmuration may be only a bit more than their body length. Imagine doing such unrehearsed maneuvers on a freeway, making sharp turns in concert with all the other fast-moving drivers around you, only a car-length apart----and you get an idea of the difficulty involved. How do they do it?iii  The ancient Romans believed that this movement as one, witnessed in starlings, was from the gods, hinting at their intentions. Early 20th Century scientists theorized that there was a natural telepathy, a group soul of some kind. In the 1970s, a biologist proposed that starlings have some kind of biological radio.  Its easy to understand how one starling knows to turn when its neighbor turns, since they are close together and can see each other. Using high-speed photography, researchers have recently determined that individual starlings in large flocks coordinate their movements with their seven nearest neighbors. Of course, I think: ChristCare groups!  And there is no single leader. A move, initiated by this starling or that, ripples through the group like the wave in a stadium crowd. Which allows for variation, beauty, and surprise. The church, too, at its best, is not a top-down organization, but a grassroots movement.  Using computer simulations, researchers have also determined that there three simple rules guiding individual starlings: 1) Avoid colliding with your immediate neighbors; 2) Be generally attracted to others of your kind; and 3) Move in the same direction. Its an organic synchronicity---repeatedly compacting and expanding---music ministry, childrens ministries, care teams, food bank, youth ministry, tutoring, public witness---individuals and small groups avoiding major collisions, coalescing through shared interests and concerns, and all moving in the same direction i Thanks to Mark Trotter for pointing out the connection between Keillors story and Pentecost. Gospel Birds can be heard on-line at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xluxFQh7sIo. ii From An Event, by Richard Wilbur. iii See the article entitled Flight Plan by Peter Frederici in the March-April issue of Audubon magazine, which got me interested in the group behavior of birds. What scientists still dont understand, however, is how starlings achieve such remarkable fluidity of motion. When one bird changes direction or speed, each of the other birds responds to the change almost simultaneously. This is true even in gigantic flocks. Its as if they are all tuned in to some invisible network. It remains a mystery, researchers say.  We might speak of Mystery with a capital M. And note that only from a great distance, a perspective far beyond that of any one starling or group of starlings, can it be seen what starlings---I mean, Christians---are doing together and apart, here and all over the world. We are forming the most magnificent Design: a graceful, wild and swirling dance.  One last connection. Physicists are now telling us that murmurations of birds are similar to other systems in nature like crystals forming, metals becoming magnetized, and liquids turning to gases. Such systems are said to be on the edge, which means theyre ready to be completely transformed in an instant. Like those disciples in the Upper Room, gathered and waiting for what would happen next. And like the Lutherans in Lake Woebegone, eyes closed and heads bowed.  Ready for a touch from God. Expecting to be blessed.  Shall we join them?  Amen.                   "
060715,"Wider Still a sermon preached at EUMC Communion 6-7-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Acts 10:9-17 & Ephesians 3:14-21  Two weeks ago we celebrated Pentecost, and the events recorded in the Book of Acts, Chapter 2. On Pentecost, you remember, the Spirit of God moved among the disciples in a powerful way. It was like electricity leaping from one to another, and over-leaping all boundaries of race, language, and creed. The Christian church was born in that outpouring of the Holy Spirit.  In our text for today, the story continues. A few years have now passed since that first Pentecost. The early church, which had its origins in Jerusalem, is spreading out into the Greco-Roman world. So far, however, the church has been made up exclusively of Jews. Like Jesus and his first disciples, they keep all the Jewish laws, including those that declare certain foods clean and others unclean. These Jewish Christians are proclaiming that Jesus, a Jewish rabbi, is the Messiah that was promised in their Hebrew scriptures.  But now, as the gospel spreads, people from various non-Jewish backgrounds---that is to say, Gentiles---are showing interest in this new religious movement. Some of these Gentiles even want to become disciples of Jesus. But they arent interested in adopting all the Jewish laws and customs, and abandoning their own. Keeping Jewish dietary laws, for instance, doesnt make much sense to them. And male circumcision? Seems pretty drastic. Do Gentiles really have to become Jewish in order to be baptized as followers of Jesus? This question is percolating within the church as our story begins.  Now heres the more immediate context. In the passage just preceding our text, a Gentile named Cornelius is introduced. Were told that Cornelius is a centurion, which means that he is an officer in the Roman army. He lives with his family in Caesarea, an assignment that suggests that he was being rewarded for exceptional loyalty and service. Cornelius is respected by the Jews because hes a man of prayer, and he gives generously to the poor. But he is still a Gentile, and so outside the circle of Gods chosen people.  One afternoon, as Cornelius is praying, he receives a word from God. He is told to send a group of emissaries to Joppa, a village on the coast. There they are to go to the home of a tanner named Simon, where a guest named Peter is staying. We who are reading along in Acts know that this is none other than the apostle Peter, of whom Jesus said, Upon this rock I will build my church.  Which brings us to our verses for today. The scene now shifts to the home of Simon the tanner. Peter, one of the original twelve disciples and now leader of the mother church in Jerusalem, is visiting there. He goes up to the flat roof of the house, where the ocean breeze provides some relief from the heat of the day, and where he can find privacy in which to pray. We are told that hes also hungry, and that below him in the house, servants are busy preparing the noon meal.  As Peter prays on the rooftop, with the smells of cooking wafting up from below, he falls into a kind of trance. A vision unfolds before him, in which the heavens open and a giant sheet descends. The sheet seems to morph into a tablecloth, however, or a picnic blanket, because the next thing Peter sees is that this gigantic cloth contains all sorts of animals, as our text says: wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.  Then Peter hears a voice saying, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. He is hungry. But the cloth contains some animals that Jews are not permitted to consume, based on the food laws in Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Peter is a devout Jew! His strict orthodox upbringing, and the laws and norms of his religious community, have shaped him deeply. In revulsion, he cries, Not so, Lord! For I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean. The voice speaks again, saying, What God has called clean, you must not call common. And then, to be sure Peter gets it, the vision is repeated two more times.  The next line says that Peter wondered within himself what this vision meant. The Greek word here is a double compound, meaning that he replayed this strange revelation in his mind, over and over, trying to discern what it might be about. Just as he starts down the ladder from the rooftop, there comes a knock at the door of the house. The emissaries of Cornelius, the Roman centurion, the Gentile seeking to know more about Jesus Christ, are literally on the doorstep, asking for Peter.  We are then told that Peter invited them in and lodged them. Jews were not to socially interact with Gentiles, who were considered unclean. It was unthinkable than an orthodox Jew like Peter would invite non-Jews into the house, sit down with them, and share a meal! But because of that vision, he does. The next day Peter accompanies these emissaries back to Caesarea, and preaches the gospel to Cornelius and his household. Cornelius becomes the first non-Jewish Christian recorded in the Bible.  In other words, the Holy Spirit---the same Spirit that moved on Pentecost---has moved again. And once again, it has overleaped the human constructs of social boundaries: What God has called clean, you must not call common. In reality, the universal embrace of Gods love had been promised to Peters ancestor Abraham, and in other Hebrew scripture as well, long before his rooftop vision. But by the time in which Peter lived, as happens again and again in history, his religious group had narrowed that message into a promise of salvation that was just for them.  So the Spirit broke through to Peter, asking him to open his heart, his mind, and his doors wider. To stretch in the direction of generosity and grace, even to overleap the barrier-setting rules of his community of faith. Because Peter obeyed, Christianity would grow from a tiny sect within Judaism---a sect which, historically, died out---into a world religion. The gospel of Gods love, revealed in Jesus, was not exclusively for the Jews, but for all people! Because of Peters vision, you and I, Gentile Christians, are included in the church today.  I know a man who reminds me of Peter in this passage. I met him in 1986, when I was fresh out of seminary and received my first appointment as a pastor. I was sent to serve Wallingford United Methodist Church in Seattle. When I arrived, one of the first to greet me was the Lay Leader of the congregation, a man named Cecil Taylor. Cecil had been a working man, like Peter. Now retired, he was still physically strong, with a thick barrel of a chest, and ramrod-straight posture. While most members of the Wallingford congregation were more artistic, educated, granola types in blue jeans and Birkenstocks, Cecil had tattoos on his arms from his days in the merchant marine, wore his silver hair cut short, and smoked a pack of cigarettes a day.  At some point in mid-life, Cecil had heard an evangelist speak, and dedicated his life to Jesus Christ. Later hed read a book that affected him profoundly. Written by Paul Tournier, it was called The Meaning of Persons. The gist of the book was that beneath our many layers of socially-conferred roles and identities, all of us are beloved children of God. On the strength of his faith and character, Cecil was the respected Lay Leader of the Wallingford congregation. He was the spiritual father of his church. Like Peter.  When I arrived as the new pastor, I was told that the church had recently voted to become whats called a Reconciling Congregation. That is, it had taken a stand to affirm the sacred worth and dignity of all people, including gay and lesbian Christians, and to publicly and unequivocally welcome them into the full life and ministry of the church. This was back in the 1980s, remember. Wallingford was one of the first United Methodist congregations in the country to take this stand.  Heres how it happened, as it was told to me. It was at a regular meeting of the Church Council, the elected leaders of the congregation. One of the Council members began by explaining that the General Conference of our denomination had recently come out with an official statement on homosexuality---we had never had one before that. The statement declared that homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.  Then that same member came out, to his friends around the table, as a gay man. Do you still love and accept me as your brother in Christ? he asked. Or do I have to become like you in order to be recognized as a follower of Jesus? If I am your brother in Christ, he said, will you vote to make that official, by becoming a Reconciling Congregation?  Well, you can imagine the discussion around that table. There was dismay, love, and fear. There were theological questions and practical considerations. If we make this choice, someone said, we will lose members and money. If we dont, someone else said, what is the difference between this and any social club? Many of you here will be familiar with this sort of discussion. You grappled with some of the same issues here in this congregation, ten years or so ago, when the man who was your beloved Music Director at that time came out as gay, and you made the costly decision to stand by him.  At Wallingford, after a couple of hours of this discussion, which was now going in circles, Cecil Taylor cleared his throat. This would be like what happens here in church meetings when Floyd Barker prepares to speak. Cecil had been quiet up to this point, but now he spoke. You know, he said, I dont know what homosexuality is. I dont know if its a sin or a choice or a disease or just one of the variations that people come in. I dont know about that. All I know is that Jesus said to love our neighbors, and he didnt say which kind of neighbors. Just, love your neighbor. So: I think we should do it. That moment was like Pentecost, like electricity leaping from one person to another around the circle. It was like the apostle Peter deciding to welcome Gentiles into the house, and sitting down to eat with them, because he had received a vision that beneath our many layers of socially-conferred roles and identities, all of us are beloved children of God. The Council voted; the motion passed. Later, looking back, Council members told me that it was an experience of the Holy Spirit, asking them to open their hearts, their minds, and their doors wider still.  On Tuesday of this past week, our own Church Council here in this congregation made the same decision, and by unanimous vote. Our church will soon be joining what is now a network of over 650 Reconciling Congregations, and our own Pacific Northwest Annual Conference, and the entire Western Jurisdiction of the United Methodist Church, in affirming the sacred worth of all persons, and officially welcoming lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning Christians into the full life and ministry of our congregation.  I tell you, these are exhilarating times! Now we are being asked to stretch in the direction of generosity and grace, even to overleap the barrier-setting rules of our General Conference, for the sake of greater faithfulness to the gospel of Gods love for all people, revealed in Jesus Christ. I believe that the decision we are making now will be confirmed by the church of the future. The church is changing. The Spirit is movingamong us!  Thanks be to God.  Amen.     "
062115tx,"Fathers Day Sermon June 21, 2015: Redefining Resiliency in our Kids Greg McLaughlin I grew up in a small town in NW Missouri, playing in the creeks, fishing with night crawlers I caught myself by flashlight, and playing lots of baseball. My life as a young boy consisted of school and sports, punctuated by hot summers whose days ended when the streetlights came on or someone needed medical attention, whichever came first. Oh yeah.. most of us had to go to church too  usually. I remember in particular the adventures I had with my friend Jamie and his little brother Matt. During the years we spent together, I am pretty sure we only came inside to eat, sleep, or  on the hottest summer days  avoid heat stroke. We caught countless snakes, crawdads, bull frogs, and fish, but our favorite prey was danger.  Ill never forget climbing to the top of the tallest Oak trees we could find, looking down onto rooftops from 4 stories in the air. Or exploring the creek and woods on the forbidden lands owned by the Bears family, who were reported to shoot salt-shot at anyone who came onto their land  somehow the trails are so much lovelier in the mind of a young boy if theres a chance of running into real danger. Or the games we invented to explore the limits of our bravery whose names alone would send any mother into therapy for PTSD  Banzai Bicycle Dodge Ball, Tree Climbing Races, Hedge Chicken (played on bikes at high speeds and involving large shrubberies), and stormwater drain spelunking. The one that broke my arm was the contest to see who could drop from the tallest tree branch without getting hurt. Most of this would have been before my 10th birthday, which I suppose I was pretty lucky to make it to. People often wonder what it is about kids and this penchant for danger. For me, it was the thrill of pushing my limits, of seeing what I was made of; of seeing what was there at the edge of the horizon. It was about what fears I could conquer, and if I had what it took to go out into that wide, awesome world and come out alright.  Even from that young age, we were asking questions of resilience and seeking out the extent of our identity. Will I be able to handle the world out there? Will I have what it takes? Will I succeed? Who will I become when I am a man? What does a real man look like? I wonder how many of you can remember those days when you thought about what you wanted to be when you grew up? Who were your heroes? Why did you choose them as your heroes? What qualities did they have? When we look at the scripture for today, we see another boy in the throes of his identity as a man. But before we get to David, lets just remember something about Goliath  he was listed at 96 in his sandals. His armor weighed 150 pounds, and the tip of his spear weighed about as much as bowling ball. If The Land of Judah were a video game, Goliath would have been the boss you have to beat at the end to win the game. Keep that image in your mind as we go along here. David, for his part, was 15 at the oldest, probably, the youngest of Jesses 4 sons. He was given the less than glamorous job of tending the sheep and taking supplies to his older brothers at the front lines. But there was SOMETHING about David, wasnt there? Because now we know that he would one day be King. But what was that something? What it factor did he have that would become the stuff of such legend? What is the writer telling us about being a man? And, by the way  what a GREAT story huh? This little guy having what it takes to take out the biggest baddest bad guy from the opposing team  its almost innate for us to love this story  because it speaks to questions lingering deep inside all of us. Well come back to David in a minute, but first, I want to tell you about what happened after I left the sunnier days of my boyhood and became a youth. Well start with 7th grade, because thats when the trouble started. Switching schools from the college lab school, where my 6th grade class had 25 students, most of whom I had known since kindergarten, I entered the towns only Junior High. As well as I had mastered my fears of outdoor dangers when I was a younger boy, these giant halls inside this unknown social labyrinth of Junior High scared me to death. There might as well have been 9 . foot tall, spear-wielding philistine at the door each day I went to school. What was I afraid of? Rejection? Ridicule? Shame? Awkwardness? Being labelled as any one of those awful names I heard kids call other kids in the halls  wuss, fag, nerd? God help me  I did NOT want to be called one of those. I learned how to fit in, but at a great cost  when the ringleaders started in on Corey, who had been one of my best friends my whole life, I did nothing to support him and laughed along with the others. I made lewd jokes about girls, or shamed weaker boys  the guys thought that was cool enough. I was in. I was surviving at the next stage of my road towards manhood. Except, the truth is, I wasnt surviving at all  I was completely tormented inside, racked with guilt over all the shaming and demeaning and tearing down I was doing to kids as part of the in crowd. Many of the people I was making fun of, like Corey, were clearly being hurt by this, and by tearing them down, I was tearing myself into two. In the end, I didnt have what it took to be one of the guys in this crowd, and I stopped playing along with their rules. I became more of a loner, and wasnt easily manipulated into the will of the crowd like I had been before  there were even times where I was seen being nicer to the dorks and apologizing for the behavior of the other guys. That didnt make the in crowd guys very happy. Within a few weeks, they had orchestrated a fist fight between myself and one of the guys in the crowd. I had no friends left. The old ones I had hurt no longer trusted me, and the new ones I had worked so hard to join had brutally ejected me from the in crowd. I remember that incredible amount of loneliness, despair, and fear leading up to the fight in the Alley behind the church where we had the weekly teen club youth dances. It was not a fear of getting physically hurt. It was not a fear of getting in trouble for fighting. It was the terror that came with the thought of punching someone. As mentioned before, I played baseball with some skill. As a center fielder, I could throw on a line to the catcher from about 200 away as a 7th grader. I wasnt a big guy, but I wasnt weak either. I couldnt imagine taking all the power of my arm and fist and hitting someone in the face. I could really hurt them. Of course, what the in crowd was doing at the time is a rite of passage that will probably be familiar to many of you. They were saying prove yourself as a man in the only way they knew how  through asserting power over another person with physical violence to demonstrate your worth. Everyone seemed to want the fight except me  here they were, opening the door for me to become a man and be welcomed back into the group with opened arms. All I had to do was go and punch another kid in the face enough times to show I was a man, but my most vivid memory was standing by the foosball table with tears welling up in my eyes at the thought of throwing even one of those punches. The fight itself was uneventful  a lot of dancing around each other with fists up, followed by a black eye, a fat lip and a lot more dancing around each other with fists up. Neither of us really wanted to be there. I could have hugged that chaperone who finally came and broke up the fight. I was lucky to have parents that I could talk to later about what had happened, but we all still had to endure the pain of the ostracism and turmoil that followed for me. It would be a year to a year and a half before I really had someone to sit with in the lunch room again. As I got older, up through high school, I would have more of these struggles to endure. As an athlete, and especially as a football player, I had a front-row seat to the locker room culture of young men. I learned to be a wallflower, quiet, in some hidden corner of the locker room as the other guys talked boisterously about who they were going to beat up or take advantage of. I won 3 varsity letters in football, but I cant remember a single word I ever said in the locker room. It was hard for awhile, but sometime around 10th grade I settled into a new and less-lonely identity. I found my friends in youth group, honors classes, and with the other forgotten kids at the corners of the cool kids world. A few years ago, my hometown of Maryvllle, MO, made national news for all the wrong reasons. From that same football locker room I grew up in, a 17 year old football player had gone out and lured a 13 year old girl out to hang out, got her drunk, and raped her. Two lives, damaged forever, all because of a malicious code of what it means to be a man that had been allowed to spill out of the locker room and into real life. Let me first say that I am implicated in this culture of violence, not only in Maryville Missouri, where I played football and grew up, but also that which prevails across our country. And I owe an apology to all those who have been a victim of violence, which includes both men and women. Because I was there - literally - in that locker room. Not during the time of this incident, but years earlier. And when people were called a"" skank"", or a ""fag"", or talked bout who they ""did"" that weekend, or whose ass they were going to kick, I didn't join in. But I didn't speak up, either. For my own reasons of fear and insecurity, I didn't speak up when I could have. I didn't just put a foot forward in that room and say something even so simple as ""hey guys.. come on! I don't really want to hear that stuff."" and I could have. I am very sorry that I didn't do more, because clearly the culture didn't change - or didn't change enough to prevent a horrible thing from happening. If it had, we wouldn't be having to read about stories like this. What I wish I had remembered is a statement someone else from that town recently posted on the facebook page for this incident We in Maryville bask in good feelings about our town and our university and their successes, but we have failed to protect our young people...our silence condemns us...the criminal justice system in ANY community reflects the power structure of the community...too few people in Maryville take leadership when something bad happens...because parents were not vigilant and failed to hold their children accountable, the lives of all the young people involved are permanently damaged...the kindest gift you can give your children is to hold them accountable for their actions...stand with them, but make them accountable. ....it takes a village to raise a child, and we are all responsible... And I really should have taken more of that to heart when I had the opportunity to hold my peers to that standard of accountability. It's a responsibility guys have as teammates, school peers, brothers, parents, teachers, coaches, and parishioners. It's a responsibility I had - to lead - and allowed fear to get the best of me. And, like I said, I really should have known better, because the above statement was written by my father, who taught me more than enough about respecting and standing up for all people. And this, my friends, is what it means to be a man  allowing your love and compassion to ignite your passions for justice. Standing up for those who are being hurt, standing up to those doing the hurting, and being brave enough to accept the consequences. See, if we get back to David and Goliath, we can ask this question again. What was that it factor that David had? He wasnt bigger or stronger or overpowering. I believe that the key detail in this whole passage is that David, unlike his brothers, is a tender of sheep. His courage came from his love of those he cared for, and that love and faith is more powerful than the mightiest foes. David did not mask himself with armor, but was clothed only in faith. He had learned to fend off the lions and protect the weak, and he defended others strongly  not because he wanted to overpower anybody with violence  but because he wanted to lovingly attend to his flock. And David himself, after killing Goliath, reminds all who are there what it means to be a real man or, in his case, a future king: 1 Samual 17:47 - All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves. What does this all really mean? For me, it comes down to the most important question of all:  How, then shall we raise our boys? The boys were raising today will be the fathers of tomorrow, and there are many challenges laying in the way. The rules of boyhood are harsh, and often violent. Hoping to promote the important survival skill of independence, we leave them alone, and vulnerable. Instead of telling our sons that the fear and sadness and uncertainty inside of them are real, we instruct them to suck it up and ignore their own humanity. We then isolate our young men from each other and themselves by plunging them into competition with each other and dressing them up in the mirages of manhood  bravado and independence and dispassion  teaching them to fight, but not to solve their problems. Too many people who do this let fear, rather than faith, guide how we prepare them for this world. And we are abandoning our sons in the process. There is no shortage of research that suggests that the most successful people are the ones who have good self-reflective and interpersonal skills, and know how to work with others to solve problems. This is true in business and in relationships, but is particularly important if we want to raise or sons to go on and become good dads. We need to emotionally engage our sons, and give them our love in addition to our expectations, and thus teach them how to emotionally engage and love others. Consider one last time the stone in Davids hand, trying to aim true to take down a giant. It would seem impossible - foolish even. Now, imagine that giant, at least metaphorically, as standing over your child getting ready to step on him or her. Imagine that you throwing that stone true would save the life of someone you love more than anything in the world. Can we, like David, learn the faith to stand up for all of Gods flock - the strong and the weak? Can we channel our love, instead of our fears? If we can, it may save our sons. In fact, this love will probably save quite a bit more than that. Indeed, with faith, and love, all things are possible. "
062815tx,"Sabbath Time a sermon preached at EUMC 6-28-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Ex. 20:8-11 & Mark 6:30-34  Some time ago, I walked into my office and discovered a book lying on the desk. It was a gift from a member of the congregation, who had seen the authors in an interview on television. There was a message attached: Kathlyn, I think you will like this book!  I always appreciate it when you all route books and articles my way. It makes sermon preparation into a communal enterprise. So I read the book, and I want to commend it to you this morning. Its called The Power of Full Engagement, by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz.  The book is really a management book, in the same genre as Stephen Coveys The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. Like Coveys book, it also has religious undertones and implications. The basic idea behind The Power of Full Engagement is that managing energy, rather than time, is the key to high performance and personal renewal.  One of the main points in the book is that if you want to maximize your positive energy in life, you have to alternate periods of activity with periods of rest.  Take physical energy, for instance. Athletes know---I am told---that if you want to build your physical capacity, you have to train by pushing yourself beyond your normal comfort zone and then backing off, allowing your body time to recover. Your muscles need 24-48 hours to be replenished, grow stronger, and become better able to handle the next challenge.  But you need this rhythm---both the systematic pushing, and the recovery time---in order to build physical capacity. If you push too hard for too long, stressing beyond ordinary limits without letting up, you will actually break down your muscles and your bodys ability to perform. If you never push at all, your muscles will atrophy and your physical capacity will likewise be diminished. In order to build physical strength and endurance, you need repeated oscillation between activity and rest. Listen to this passage from the book:  Nearly every athlete we have worked with has come to us with performance problems that could be traced to an imbalance between the expenditure and recovery of energy. They were either over-training or under-trainingBoth over- and under-training have performance consequences that include persistent injuries and sickness, anxiety, negativity and anger, difficulty concentrating, and loss of passion. We achieved our breakthroughs with athletes by helping them to more skillfully manage energypushing themselves to systematically increase capacity, but also building in regular recovery as part of their training regimens.  The authors continue:  When we expend energy, we draw down our reservoir. When we recover energy, we fill it back up. Full engagement requires cultivating a dynamic balance between the expenditure of energy and the renewal of energy in all dimensions. We call this rhythmic wave oscillation, and it represents the fundamental pulse of life.i  Balancing stress and recovery time is critical not just in sports, but in all facets of life. If we want to maximize our mental capacity, for instance, we need to oscillate between periods of mental stretching---through concentrated study, perhaps---and periods of mental rest. How many older adults do you know who do crossword puzzles or Luminosity drills on the computer for just this reason: to keep their minds active and alert? Artists and scientists testify that creativity demands both periods of focused concentration and periods of mental disengagement. Albert Einstein said that his best ideas came to him while he was shaving in the morning.  Emotionally, too, we grow through this same pattern of oscillation. If you want to build capacity for emotional depth and resilience, you need to push beyond your normal limits by actively engaging with other people, and with your own feelings. But no one can sustain intensity of emotion all the time without going numb or burning out. So periodically you need to back off, disengage, and give yourself an emotional rest.  What about the spiritual dimension of life? Does the same principle apply? In our first reading for this morning, the 4th of the 10 Commandments is given: to keep the Sabbath, to work productively for six days each week, and to honor the seventh as a day of rest. The word Sabbath comes from the Hebrew verb shabbat, which means, to rest. One of the earliest teachings in the Bible, then, specifies that for our spiritual strength and endurance, we are to adopt a life pattern of oscillation between engagement and disengagement. We are to alternate between activity and rest, work and Sabbath time.  My favorite story about the importance of Sabbath time is a true story. It involves a wagon train that traveled from St. Louis to Oregon in the 1800s. The wagon trains members were devout Christians, so the group made a practice of stopping every Sunday to observe a day of rest.  Winter was approaching quickly, however, and some members of the group began to panic in fear that they wouldnt reach their destination before the heavy snows. Consequently, several members proposed to the others that they should quit their practice of stopping on the Sabbath and continue driving onward seven days a week.  This proposal triggered great contention in the community. Finally it was suggested that the wagon train should split up into two groups---those who wanted to observe the Sabbath and those who wanted to travel on that day. The proposal was accepted. Both groups traveled together until the next Sunday, when one group went on while the other remained at rest.  Guess which group got to Oregon first.ii  Youre right. The ones who kept the 4th Commandment reached their destination first. Both the horses and the people were so rested by their Sabbath observance that they could travel more vigorously and effectively the other six days of the week.  This pattern, or principle, occurs again and again in the Bible. When Moses becomes weary of leading his people through their trials in the desert, God tells him, My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest. To the prophet Isaiah, God says: In returning and rest you shall find salvation; in quietness and trust you shall find your strength. In our gospel reading for today, in the midst of unrelenting activity, Jesus instructs his disciples: Come away by yourselves to a deserted place, and rest awhile.  When we think of Jesus as portrayed in the gospels, we often picture him teaching, preaching to the multitudes, and attending to the crowds who sought his healing touch. We might not notice that in those same gospel accounts, Jesus often sends people away, with neither explanation nor excuse. He simply stops, retires to a quiet place---alone, or with his friends---and prays. Its interesting to note, in fact, that one translation of the biblical verb to pray is to come to rest.  The biblical assumption is that when we pray, at least three things happen:  First, we withdraw. We pull away from the activities and demands of the world, from the scramble of panting feverishnessiii that describes too much of our lives. We dont wait until someone gives us permission or until all our work is completed. In fact, for the sake of our productivity and effectiveness, we oscillate away from work, and leave it for a time.  Second, we allow our souls to quiet down. There is no more profound rest in this world than the peace of communing with God. Consciously bringing our lives into Gods presence, we remember that God is God, and that---thankfully---we are not. We can let go of being driven by the clock or the dollar or our own inflated sense of self-importance. And we can remember that, as Rabbi Abraham Heschel puts it: just to be is a blessing; just to live is holy.  Finally, we open ourselves to Gods guidance. Sabbath time allows the reality of God to stand in the midst of our lives, and become the calm center out of which we live. When we return to the demands of our busy workday lives, and when we are rocked by events as diverse as murder in a Charleston church, the release of a papal encyclical on climate change, and a decision by the Supreme Court on marriage rights---we know whoand Whose---we are. We are able to respond from a deep place of clarity, and passionate commitment to the world God loves.  Maya Angelou, the beloved poet and playwright, speaks to the importance of Sabbath timeand how it enables full engagement with life---in a reflection called, A Day Away. She writes:  Each person deserves a day away in which no problems are confronted, no solutions searched for. If we step away for a time, we are not, as some will accuse, being irresponsible, but rather we are preparing ourselves to more ably perform our duties and discharge our obligations. When I return home after such time, Im always surprised to find that some questions I sought to evade have been answered, and some entanglements Id hoped to flee have sorted themselves out. A day away is like a spring tonic. It can dispel rancor, transform indecision, and renew the spirit.iv  Well, what about your life? Do you have a healthy rhythm of alternating activity and rest, work and worship? Or does your pattern need some adjusting in one direction or the other? Can you hear, in the 4th Commandment and in Jesus words, an invitation to both inner peace and outer effectiveness? Remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy. Come away by yourselves to a deserted place, and rest awhile. Amen.  i From Jim Loehr & Tony Schwartz, The Power of Full Engagement (New York: Free Press, 2003) p. 29 ii Thanks to Marva Dawn, in Keeping the Sabbath Wholly (Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B.

071215tx,"A Time to Be Born, a Time to Die For Everything a Season I EUMC 7-12-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Ecclesiastes 3:1-13 & Psalm 90:1-6, 9b-10, 12  Erma Bombeck, the beloved columnist, wrote a book called, If Life Is a Bowl of Cherries, What Am I Doing in the Pits?i In it she describes a moment when she realized she was aging. She was driving the car, with her mother beside her in the passenger seat. Her mother had always been strong and independent. In recent years, however---although Erma resisted seeing it---Mom had been changing. She was slowing down. When they went somewhere together in the car, she had begun asking Erma to drive.  Now they were driving along in heavy traffic, and suddenly an emergency occurred up ahead. Erma slammed on the brakes. Instinctively she threw out her right arm, to protect her mother from hitting the windshield.  When the crisis had passed, the two women sat blinking at each other. In that moment, each realized that something had changed in their relationship. In prior years, Mom would have attempted to protect Erma. Erma writes, When did it happen? When did it happen that the mother became the daughter, and the daughter became the mother?  When does it happen? It may happen almost imperceptibly, or it may crystallize in one moment like that: the realization that time is passing, and you are no longer young. On the day your teenage son beats you in tennis for the first time, say. Or the day the salesgirl in the store calls you maam instead of miss. Or the day you go to the dermatologist about some strange-looking spots on your skin and he says breezily, Oh, those are nothing to worry about; these things just appear as we get older. I like to call them barnacles.  Charles Simmons, the writer, says that it hit him one day when a young woman stopped him on the street and asked for directions. He realized, in the course of their short conversation, that the girl had selected him not because he was attractive and approachable, but because she perceived him as older, fatherly, and therefore, safe. She never even saw him as an available male; he had been screened out as a sexual person. Simmons went home and examined his receding hairline in the mirror.  Sometimes the awareness of time passing comes with a terrible shock. You get a call in the night: one of your parents has had a stroke. Or one of your best friends---someone your own age!---has a heart attack. Youre shaken. And it hits you again that time is passing; you are growing older, and so is everyone you know.  Gradually or suddenly, and most commonly in mid-life, we come face to face with this reality: that our mortal lives have a beginning and an end, like a sentence enclosed between two brackets. Life is a journey between these two fixed poles, and every one of us---wherever our age---is moving from one toward the other, from birth toward death. As our text for this morning expresses it: To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die. Today we begin a sermon series on Chapter 3 of the Book of Ecclesiastes. Ecclesiastes is one of the five books of the Bible that are classified as wisdom literature. From a biblical point of view, wisdom begins with the awareness that life is a journey from birth to death. Whatever meaning there is to be found in life, therefore, must be located within these God-given parameters.  Everything else that Ecclesiastes has to say will flow from this opening line: To everything there is a seasona time to be born, and a time to die. So let me introduce our series, this morning, by giving you an overview of the Book of Ecclesiastes, which takes the form an extended meditation on this theme.ii  We dont know much about the person who wrote this book of the Bible, or exactly when he lived. His name, Ecclesiastes, is obscure, and doesnt appear in any other ancient manuscripts. Grammatically, it means something like the one who convenes an assembly, which suggests that he was probably a teacher of some sort.  A Jewish tradition claims that King Solomon was the author of Ecclesiastes: that when he was young and in love, he wrote the Song of Songs; when he matured, he wrote the Book of Proverbs; and when he grew older, he looked back over his life and wrote down his reflections, called the Book of Ecclesiastes. Whether Solomon actually wrote the book or not, it seems clear, at least, that the man we know as Ecclesiastes was in his later years, acutely aware that he was aging, and trying to deal with his fear of growing old and dying without having truly lived. He has tried several ways of coping with this fear. He writes to tell us what hes learned.  First, Ecclesiastes says, he did what many bright young people do, or at least what they are taught to do: he set out to be successful, and make a lot of money. And he did that. He writes, I multiplied my possessions. I built myself houses and planted vineyards I gathered for myself silver and gold.  But, Ecclesiastes says, I couldnt escape this nagging feeling that something was missing. Id achieved success, but I lay awake at night and wondered, Wasnt life supposed to be about more than this? Besides, he says, I realized that I could lose my money, or I could die, and have to leave it all behind. He writes, There is an evil I have observed under the sun, that God sometimes grants a person property and wealth, so that there is no want for anything, but God does not permit that person to enjoy it. Disaster can strike at any time, and death comes to everyone, both rich and poor.  So Ecclesiastes contemplates his own mortality. Time is passing; he is aging. He then follows a pattern you may recognize: he makes a wild effort to recapture his lost youth. Like the middle-aged man who leaves his wife for a younger woman or buys a sports car to make himself feel young again, Ecclesiastes explains, I said to myself, Come, I will treat you to merriment. I ventured to tempt my flesh with wine, I withheld from my eyes nothing they asked for. But one morning he wakes up next to someone who, he realizes, looks a lot like his daughter or he injures himself trying some athletic feat of his youthor hes up half the night with indigestion after a rich mealand finally he writes, This, too, I found was futile. Of revelry, I said, what good is it?  Now a sense of urgency creeps into Ecclesiastes writing. He has begun to fear that the good times are behind him, that most of the good things that will ever happen to him have already happened. It occurs to him that he might come to the end of his life without ever knowing what his life was for. So he leaves his manic pleasure-seeking behind, and tries to make sense of his life through learning.  Somewhere, in all the books written by the wisest people of the past, there must be an answer to his quest for meaning. Ecclesiastes sets out to test the Jewish proverb, A wise person has eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. But as he studies, what Ecclesiastes learns, to his dismay, is that even if the wise person does see more clearly, what he or she sees isthe futility of life! The wiser people become, the more aware they are of lifes tragedies and injustices. Their illusions drop away; they cant help but see that violence and stupidity often do hold sway in this world.  Besides, Ecclesiastes is now old enough that the shadow of death, looming ahead, is threatening to rob everything of meaning. He sees his teachers growing old, their brilliance fading into cranky forgetfulness. He writes, What good is it, if I am wise and my neighbor is foolish? Were both going to die in any case, and our learning will perish with us.  All of which brings Ecclesiastes to his famous conclusion: Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. Neither wealth, nor compulsive pleasure-seeking, nor even learning will answer his burning question, What is the point of it all?  But the book of Ecclesiastes was not included in the Bible to persuade us that, in fact, life is pointless. Ultimately, Ecclesiastes finds an answer. Now he shares it in these words:  Go, eat your bread in gladness, and drink your wine in joy, for your action was long ago approved by God. Let your clothes always be freshly washed and your head never lack ointment. Enjoy happiness with the one you love all the fleeting days of life that have been granted to you under the sun. Whatever it is in your power to do, do with all your might. For there is no doing, no learning, no wisdom in the grave where you are going.  What is Ecclesiastes saying here? Is he reduced to saying, Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die? No. Listen again to the beautiful simplicity of each line of his advice:  Go, eat your bread in gladness, and drink your wine in joy. That is to say: I have learned that life is not all about achieving success, or acquiring anything. Life is about enjoying a meal and lifting a glass with a friend. By the time you reach my age, you cant escape the knowledge that there are losses in life. Let them teach you to savor the gifts of the present moment, and to feel intense gratitude for the gift that your life is right now. When was the last time you truly savored the sweetness of a peach? How often do you engage in activities not as a means to some other end but for their own sake: a romp with the dog, a lively conversation, a good laugh?  for your action was long ago approved by God. That is: theres no need to keep trying so hard to be somebody or do something good enough to justify your own existence. You are good enough; your life has intrinsic, sacred worth. God approves of you, and always has, entirely apart from anything you earn or accomplish. Trust that. Rest in it. Go deeper spiritually, and discover the unspeakable sweetness of communing with God.  Let your clothes always be freshly washed and your head never lack ointment. That is, honor your body. (Some of us are still working on this one!) Take care of yourself: eat right, exercise, enjoy the physical comforts of a hot shower and clean clothes. Dont abuse or denigrate your body; make peace with it. Are you over the age of forty? Its time to finally accept and approve of your physical self: what, are you going to reach the age of eighty and still be saying, I hate my nose?  Enjoy happiness with the one you love all the fleeting days of life that have been granted to you under the sun. That is, life is short. It is too short to be filled with resentments, quarreling, and regrets. Give yourself to the one you love. Practice the habit of forgiveness. Love all the people you love as well as you can, for as long as you can. At the end of your life, this is what will have mattered most: your relationships, the love you have known and shared.  Whatever it is in your power to do, do with all your might. OK, so you cant do everything, and there is much in lifemore than you once thought---that is beyond your control. But look around and see what the world needs, and decide what you can do. You have gifts to give, and you are uniquely positioned to make a difference in someones life. Maybe many someones. Offer your gifts. Make your contribution.  For there is no doing, no learning, no wisdom in the grave where you are going. For in fact, the very thing that you fear and fight against---the transitory nature of life, its boundaries and limits---is what makes it so precious, so achingly dear. From birth to death---and beyond---we belong to God. We are in good hands. The writer Brenda Ueland, on her eightieth birthday, sent one line of advice to her children. So, she said: While you are alive, be alive!  This is the wisdom of Ecclesiastes. Amen.        i Erma Bombeck, If Life Is a Bowl of Cherries, What Am I Doing in the Pits?

071915tx,"A Time to Break Down, a Time to Build Up For Everything a Season II 7-19-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James at EUMC texts: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 & Joshua 3:1-6 & 14-17  A couple of weeks ago, I was driving to church, coming around the top of Lake Washington on Bothell Way. It was a maddening experience: one construction zone after another! A flagger here, the road narrowed to one lane there; I thought Id never get to work.  With the traffic crawling along, I found myself thinking, Seems like there has been construction on this road every summer since I moved here! Cant they just leave it alone for five minutes? This road was working fine for me the way it was. Do they really have to keep changing it?  And then it occurred to me that this is how people sometimes feel about church, too. Do we really need that new flat screen TV with scrolling announcements out by the church office? Do we need to change the words of the old hymns to be more inclusive? Why should we take on this new mission, or that emerging social issue: cant we just hold still for five minutes? The church was working fine for me the way it was. Do we really have to keep changing?  Of course, then I had to laugh, since I know as well as you do that wherever there is life, there is change. I ask you: what is the only alternative to change? Its death. The only things that never change are not alive.  There is a great example of that in the novel by Charles Dickens, Great Expectations. Do you remember the character, Miss Haversham? She was the woman who was deserted on her wedding day, and who spent the rest of her life sitting in the parlor with her wedding cake moldering away, and wearing her wedding dress, which was slowly turning to rags. Her non-acceptance of change was essentially a refusal to live. Living is a dynamic thing, always in process. Where there is no change, there is no life.  I saw a bumper sticker the other day. It said, If you never change your mind, are you sure you still have one? The implication, of course, is that when we are no longer willing or able to change, we have begun to die.  Last week we began this series on Ecclesiastes 3 by acknowledging the God-given boundaries of human life: To everything there is a season, a time to be born, and a time to die. That is, there is a beginning and an ending to our mortal lives. But between birth and death, there are countless other beginnings and endings, one opening into the other. The world turns; one season gives way to the next. And this is how life goes forward. From childhood through adulthood and into old age, all of us will have to negotiate the process of change, again and again, in order to live and grow.  If change is a given in life, and Gods way of moving life forward.and if the refusal to change is a choice to stagnate and diethen wisdom has something to do with embracing change. And wisdom has something to do with learning to navigate the processes of change with skill and grace. This is true for communities as well as individuals. Hence the line from the wisdom of Ecclesiastes to which we turn today: there is a time to break down, and a time to build up. A little over a hundred years ago, anthropologists began to study how humans have traditionally helped one another through the processes of change. It was a man named Arthur Van Gennep, studying traditional cultures around the world, who first coined the term, rites of passage.  Van Gennep noticed that there is a certain pattern by which traditional societies have always marked the major milestones---the big and predictable changes---in human life. He grouped together rites of passage dealing with birth, coming of age, marriage, and death. He saw that all these rituals had in common a pattern of three distinct phases. First, there is a leaving and letting go---a time of breaking down what is past; then a sort of neutral zone, a pause suspended between past and future; then finally comes the time to build up, a new beginning in which life goes forward.i  This pattern of breaking down, pausing, and building anew is found in all great religions. In the African societies that Van Gennep studied, adolescent youths break with the past by leaving their villages, go into the bush to wander for a time, and then return to be recognized as adult members of the tribe. In Jewish tradition, the same pattern is found in the story of the Exodus, in which the Hebrews leave their slavery in Egypt, wander in the wilderness for forty years, and then enter the Promised Land. Our second reading for this morning encapsulates this process of change: the people break camp on one side of the River Jordan, literally and physically cross over the riverbed, and emerge to build a new life on the other side.  In Christian tradition, it is no accident that Jesus leaves his life as a carpenter, goes into the wilderness for forty days, and then begins his ministry. The core story of our faith, the death and resurrection of Jesus, follows the same pattern. There is a definitive ending, three days in the tomb, then a whole new life. Or as the writer of Ecclesiastes puts it: a time to break down--- and---a time to build up. This is the pattern and promise of our faith.  Think of the major changes in your life so far. Can you trace this same pattern in your own times of transition?  First there is a breaking down, a dismantling, a break with the past. It may be gradual or it may happen suddenly, like falling off a cliff---a divorce, a job change, a move, a diagnosis that changes everything. It may be something you sought and worked for---this is the season of weddings and graduations---or something you never in your wildest dreams imagined would happen. In either case, its an ending. Life as you once knew it is overand you cant go back. This can be a time of shock and grief, as you try to process what has taken place.  For in fact, every life change---even those we welcome and celebrate---begins with an ending. I remember my first day in seminary, for instance. I was so glad and grateful to be there! But that night, I sat on the edge of the bed in that unfamiliar dorm room and cried. At the time, I couldnt have told you why. But some part of me recognized that my life was changing. The roles and circumstances by which I had identified myself up to that point were being left behind.  Judith Viorst has written a beautiful book called Necessary Losses. About the breaking down that is part of every life transition, she writes: Ive learned that in the course of our life we leave and let go of much that we love. Losing is the price we pay for living. It is also the source of much of our growth and gain. Making our way from birth to death, we also have to make our way through the pain of giving upportions of what we cherish. We have to deal with our necessary losses. [She goes on:]  We should understand how these losses are linked to our gains. For in leaving the blurred- boundary bliss of mother-child oneness, we become a conscious, unique and separate self and in giving up our impossible expectations, we become a lovingly connected self, renouncing ideal visions of perfect friendship, marriage, and family life for the sweet imperfections of all-too-human relationships.  In confronting the many losses that are brought by time and death, we become an adapting self, finding at every stage---until we draw our final breath---opportunities for creative transformations.ii  As people of faith, we trust that every ending contains the seeds of the new beginning. So we enter the second phase of change, that wilderness time in which you catch your breath and take your bearings. In this period, the and between breaking down and building up, youre traveling without a map. Old rules no longer apply; old ways of doing things no longer work. Whats called for now is: courage. And patience, endurance, and willingness to live with ambiguity. This is a time of disorientation, but of freedom and creativity too.  This interim phase of change is often overlooked or undervalued. Others may be uncomfortable or distressed with what may look like lostness on your part. Subtly or overtly, they say, Hurry up and get over it! They may pressure you to Change back to the way you were before! But the traditional societies who sent their young people off on vision quests knew that this in-between time is to be honored for its own sake. Its like the fallow season of winter: beneath the surface, things are happening. The same rhythm puts us to sleep at night and wakes us in the morning, after a dark time full of half-remembered and enigmatic clues.  How often have you heard people who are retiring from their working life say, Im not going to make any new commitments for awhile, or fill my schedule with the same kinds of things Ive always done before. Im going to let things settle, and then figure out what I really want to do. Wise words, according to Ecclesiastes. This is a time for integration and readjustment. Give it time; dont rush.  Which ushers us into the third phase of change, what Ecclesiastes calls the time to build up. In that fallow, germinating time, youve been forced to experiment, to try on new behaviors and roles. Youve had to develop new rituals and routines. Youve found ways to survive; youve found friends and resources. You look back and are amazed to see how far you have come. And now, on new terms and with new rules, the next chapter of your life begins.  Think of important beginnings in your own past. You bumped into an old friend that you hadn't seen for years, who told you about a job at his company that opened up just that morning. You met your spouse-to-be at a party that you really hadn't wanted to go to and almost skipped. You happened to pick up a book that totally changed your life because it was the only one lying on i For more on these stages, see William Bridges, Transitions: Making Sense of Lifes Changes (New York; Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1980) ii Judith Viorst in Necessary Losses: the Loves, Illusions, Dependencies, and Impossible Expectations that All of Us Have to Give Up in Order to Grow (New York: Fawcett Gold Medal, Ballantine Books, 1986) p. 366  your friends coffee table. The lesson in all such experiences is that when we are ready to make a new beginning, the opportunity comes.  Your task now, in this building-up phase, is to look for the gains on the other side of your losses. Look for signs of new life, wherever they may spring up. Tend to them, as you would green plants in the garden. Recognize that the seasons have turned: you dont want to be like Miss Haversham, frozen in time. This may or may not be a change you wanted or the life you planned, but it is your life now. It will have its own gifts, as well as challenges. Take them on. Let yourself experience glimmers of hope, and moments of joy.  To everything there is a season: a time to break down---and---a time to build up. This basic pattern is so essential to Gods way of bringing about growth and renewal that we must learn to embrace it in our lives, and in each others lives, with skill and grace.  Think back to the last major change in your life. Isnt it true that when we are in the midst of change, we are more alive than at any other time? In the midst of change, we are most full of what life is. We are called upon to see and hear in our lives what is most truly there, and to make choices; to come or go; to withhold or give ourselves; to refuse to feel, or to laugh and cry.  In the midst of change, we feel the meaning of our lives most intensely. We discover how much we need each other. We discover how much we need God. And if we are wise, we come to recognize that change, at every age and stage of life, is an opportunity to be blessed.  Amen.           "
072615tx,"A Time to Weep, a Time to Heal For Everything a Season III EUMC 7-26-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 & Luke 13:31-35  What is the shortest sentence in the Bible? Do you know? Its printed at the top of your worship guide this morning: Jesus wept. Jesus wept over the death of his friend, Lazarus. Our Bible describes Jesus as a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.  Todays reading from Lukes gospel tells how Jesus was on his way into Jerusalem, where he would be arrested and crucified within the week. He stood on a hill overlooking the city and cried, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!  Jesus wept over this wayward, wounded world. I ask you: what kind of person would he have been if he had not?  This morning, as we continue with our exploration of Ecclesiastes 3, we come to the words, a time to weep, a time to heal. This is one of the clearest truths in the whole passage. In the pain and sorrow that comes to each of our individual lives, and given all the suffering in this weary world, there is definitely a time for weeping.  Why do we human beings weep, anyway? And I am not referring now to the tears that spring to our eyes when we smash a finger with a hammer, say, or to the petulant tears we might cry in childish frustration at not getting our way. When we read that Jesus wept or when Ecclesiastes says there is a time to weep, what is meant is weeping in the sense of the dictionary definition, to express grief, sorrow, or any overpowering emotion by shedding tears.  Theres a connection between weeping and love. That is, we dont weep about every little loss and minor disappointment we experience. We weep when something---or someone---we love is threatened or violated or taken from us. We weep because we are interconnected, and what connects us to one another also breaks our hearts.  We weep for the loss of the things that have brought us our greatest joy, which is how we discover, at some point in life, that tears of joy and tears of sorrow spring from the same well. That well is love: love for other people, for ourselves, for God, for life itself in this beautiful, broken world. In fact, weeping may be the best indicator of what life is really about for us. What we cry about, we care about.  If we dont allow ourselves to weep, to face the pain that inevitably comes with caring about anything or anybody, we do so only at great cost. Its not healthy to insist that our deep hurts, our appalling losses and great personal mistakes do not exist, or dont matter. On the contrary: to weep tears of frustration and pain about such things may be to take our first steps toward honesty, toward mental health, toward claiming a life that is worth living.  Tears attune us to ourselves and to other people. If we dont weep on the personal level, we will never understand the humanity around us. If we dont weep on a public level, we are less than fully human ourselves. There are some things worth weeping about, lest we lose our own humanity. There are some things about which, if we do not weep, we betray the human race.  A reporter on national TV asks a young flier in the Persian Gulf, How was your strafing run tonight? Fantastic! the young man exclaims. It was a turkey shoot! We blasted them as they ran! It was nothing, in other words, to gun down other human beings who were running for their lives. It was done without a tear. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, says Jesus, I have wept over you like a mother over her child. In face of human callousness toward violence and death, Jesus wept.i  Ancient Christian teachers wrote of what they called the gift of tears. What they meant was the ability to feel sorrow for ones sins, for ones own participation in the pain of the world. To have the gift of tears is to have the heart to care about what we do to one another.  Have you seen the movie, Dead Man Walking? Its based on the true story of a nun who, through a series of circumstances, becomes the spiritual advisor of a convicted criminal on death row. The nun is played by Susan Sarandon. The criminal, played by Sean Penn, is a fascinating character study.  I wont ruin the movie for you, in case you havent seen it, by telling you the plot or what happens in the end. But let me tell you this. Throughout most of the movie, this convict displays no remorse for his part in the crime, and no feeling of empathy for either the victims or their families. Actually, he shows no signs of sadness even for himself.  But there comes a turning point in the movie. If you see itand you can get it on Netflix--- watch for this. There comes a moment when, having been cared for and treated as a human being, rather than as an animal or a monster, by the nun, the convict breaks down. Or it might be more accurate to say: he breaks open. In a powerful scene, this seemingly heartless character breaks, and begins to shake with racking sobs. He weeps. For the first time, he expresses human feeling, even grief, for the persons he has harmed.  The weeping in that scene has something to do with becoming more fully human. It has something to do with finally connecting to other people in a meaningful way. It has something to do with healing. There is a time to weep, and a time to heal. As Ecclesiastes knows, there is a connection between the two. Becoming able to weep can be the first step in healing, the first sign that healing is taking place.  One of my friends and colleagues in ministry, Rebecca Parker, tells a story about a family in a congregation she served. Lyle and Maxine, elderly members of the church, were brother and sister. Maxine told Becky of how, at the end of World War II, Lyle had come home. The day he arrived---the only veteran to return alive to his small town---everyone came out to meet him. The train pulled into the station, the band played, and the mayor was there to shake his hand.  But as his sister Maxine explained, the man who climbed off the train was not the lively, cheerful boy who had left for war. He was a ghost. He didnt seem to recognize anyone. In response to the crowds rousing welcome, he stared mutely. Blank. His family took him home to the farm, where he sat in the rocking chair in the parlor. He didnt speak or move, and would barely eat. He continued in this state for days that spilled into weeks that flowed into months. No one in that town knew about post-traumatic shock; they only knew that Lyles soul was lost somewhere.  Lyles sister, Maxine, decided to stay with him. Whenever she could, she would come and sit with him, and she would talk. Shed tell him about the church potluck: who was there, what they ate, what each young woman wore. Shed tell him about the conversation shed overheard at the store in town, and how high the crops had grown. She told him how the wind that day had blown the clean laundry into the tomatoes. When she ran out of things to say, she would just sit with him, snapping beans, mending socks. And he sat there, silent, like a stone. Rocking.  One night, while Maxine was knitting quietly beside him, Lyles eyes filled with tears. The tears spilled over and ran down his frozen face. Maxine went to her brother and put her arms around him. Held in his sisters embrace, he began to cry full force, great sobs of anguish bursting forth from deep inside him.  Then Lyle began to talk, and would not stop. He talked of the cold, the fear, the noise, the death of his buddies, the long marches. And then of the human beings in the camps, the mass graves, the smell. He talked all night, until the dawn light began to creep across the fields. Maxine listened to everything that Lyle had to say. Then she went into the kitchen and cooked him breakfast. Brother and sister ate together, and then Lyle went out and did the morning chores.ii  Tears can release us from the past; what gushes out in a torrent of tears loses its power to control us. The un-grieved deaths of our lives can finally go to rest once the tears come. The memories of hurts and rejections grown larger through the years can shrink to size in the water of tears.  Here is a way that we, as a community, can participate in Gods way of bringing about healing. We can draw alongside each other, as Maxine did for her brother Lyle. We can set aside our own judgments and agendas and offer the gift of loving, listening attention. In so doing, we can create a safe space for tears to fall and truth to be told. We can hear each others stories of struggle and pain: every soul on earth is seeking to be known and understood. We can weep for each other. We can help each other heal.  And the miracle is: healing happens. As one of you said to me this week, The best sign of Gods presence in the world is that healing can occur, and does occur. Its Gods most powerful way of being in the world with us: taking a stand beside us, suffering with us, and healing us. Or as the writer Oscar Wilde puts it: Where there is sorrow, there is holy ground.iii  When Jesus wept over Jerusalem, the die was cast. The same compassion that gave rise to his tears also propelled him down the hill, into the city, to do what was his to do to change the world. We go through a similar process. Pain is a challenge to change things. A longing to be fully human and to live without always having to shut down and close off when painful things come alongturns into a longing to be there for your friends when they are in trouble, and to be of real help to this poor, aching planet.  There is a time to weep, and a time to heal. Let us participate in the work of God. Amen. i Thanks for this story and related insights to Joan Chittister in For Everything a Season (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 2013) p. 125 ii I heard Rebecca tell this story most recently at the United Methodist Clergywomens Consultation in Chicago, July 2006.

080215tx,"A Time to Mourn, a Time to Dance For Everything a Season IV EUMC 8-2-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 & Isaiah 61:1-3  [An Introduction to the personal testimony to follow; time constraints with VBS singing & communion Sunday]  Have you ever been through a shattering loss? The loss of your health, perhaps, or a divorce, or the death of a loved one? Can you look back on that time, now, and remember how it was? Perhaps you were dazed with grief. You walked out of the hospital, or the courtroom, or the mortuary, or wherever you were when things fell apart.  And you discovered, to your surprise, that the world was still turning, as it has every day of your life. Clouds were moving across the sky. The grass was still a brilliant green. People were walking on the sidewalk, traffic whizzing by on the street. How was it possible? In spite of all that had happened, in spite of your broken heart, by some unseen and unimaginable power, life was going on.  Almost forty years ago, I lost the baby I was carrying---my first, and I was young, and not yet well-acquainted with grief. It was the capstone to what was, up to that point, the saddest year of my life. When I came home from the hospital, neighbors offered kind words of condolence---but as you know, most things that people say at such times, even if they are true, dont really help.  There was one woman, however, who did say something that helped me. She was an older woman who had also lost a child. I knew she was a woman of faith, but she didnt offer any religious platitudes. She just sat quietly on the couch, letting me be.  But finally she reached over, took my hand in hers, and said, I know its hard to believe this.but a year from now, you wont feel the way you do today. You will still grieve---youll love and remember your child as long as you live---but the quality of your grief will change, over time. One day, youll find yourself feeling happy again. Youll see. Things will get better. Your life will go on.  I wasnt sure I did believe her, at that moment, but she had thrown me a lifeline. Words of wisdom, like prayer beads on a string. Something to hold onto, day by day and month by month of living it through, doing the next indicated thing. Meanwhile the world continued to turn.  The season of mourning took its course. And as spring follows winter, the day came when I was happy again. I began to learn, then, as most of us do---through life experience---the wisdom of Ecclesiastes: To everything there is a season: a time to mourn, and a time to dance.  Clichs are usually clichs because they express well-worn truth. Time heals all wounds. This too shall pass. There is a certain affront to it---the world continuing to turn, when our own world has collapsed---but also a promise, a hope. Life is going to go on, whether we can picture how or not, whether we will it or not. Even in the midst of despair, we find ourselves being sustained, our lives carried forward on unseen hands. Grace comes from places we didnt expect; possibilities for growth arise even from the ashes of grief. One day we find ourselves laughing again, in spite of ourselves, and loving again, when we thought we never would. A new chapter opens. Life goes on.  Can we learn to trust that? Although Ecclesiastes never mentions the word God, thats what hes talking about: trusting God. I think of natures quiet determination to bring forth life from death, again and again, the persistence that is built right into Gods creation. I think of the Psalm printed at the top of your worship guide this morning: Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes in the morning. I think of Jesus promising that those who mourn will be blessed. I think of the central cycle of our Christian faith, the one we practice living through every year: the grief of Good Friday, the resurgence of new life on Easter.  Can we learn to face into seasons of mourning with faith that spring will come again, love will come again, and though we cant imagine how right now, we will dance again? To live, therefore, with abiding hope? And then, when the season of dancing comes, to embrace it with gratitude and appreciation, and with full awareness that it, too, is a season that will come and go?  There is deep wisdom here, in the Book of Ecclesiastes. We hear an invitation to allow our mourning to become a place of healing, and our sadness a way through pain to dancing.  There are people, here in this room, who carry this wisdom and share it with us. I think, for instance, of one of you here who is going through a season of mourning. You shared with me a poem that illuminates where you are right now. The poem is called Woman and Field:  Mom, he says, its been raining and sunny, and do you think the morels are up yet? We go walking in the field where weve found them before, but they are not there.  How many times do I walk in my mind to the places Ive found some sense of purpose or conviction, only to find them empty?  Finn finds a rabbits foot in the field, the leg bone still attached. Its lucky, Mom, he says. We leave it where it is and let the luck follow us if it will.  And perhaps it does. Today, everywhere I turn in my mind I fail to find the answers I want. But what shows up is a softness, a fertile field in the unknown where I can rest. It feels rainy and sunny at the same time. I can almost feel something deep inside pushing its way up to the surface ready to be found in its own time.i i Thanks to Lynne Weakland for sharing this poem: Woman and Field, by Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer, May 3, 2005, found on A Hundred Falling Veils: A Daily Poetry Practice, on-line at http://ahundredfallingveils.com/2015/05/03/woman-and-field/  To everything there is a season: a time to mourn, and a time to dance. We can go through periods of mourning with acceptance and trust that life will go on, in its own time. Even now, at this very moment, the unquenchable power of God is at work to bring healing and wholeness, goodness and love, into your life and mine.  Listen now to two others in our midst, who can testify to the wisdom of Ecclesiastes.  [Bonnie & Hank speak]              "
080915tx,"A Time to Keep Silence, a Time to Speak For Everything a Season V EUMC 8-9-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 & Ephesians 4:25-32  The Genesis story of creation begins in silence. The Spirit of God broods over the face of the deep. Then God speaks. You might almost say that at last God speaks. Let there be light, God says. According to Genesis, God breaks the cosmic silence with a creative word.  Then follows a rhythm of silence, speaking, silence, speaking. God speaks six times on six days, each followed by a night of silence. On the seventh day, God rests. Alternating silence and speech is the very rhythm of God, as old and deep in the nature of things as creation itself.i  Right from the start, then, the biblical assumption is that silence and speech naturally takes turns, back and forth. Which brings us to todays line in the Book of Ecclesiastes. Theres a season for everything, Ecclesiastes has been telling us. There is a sacred rhythm by which life unfolds, including a time to be silent, and a time to speak.  Certainly there is a time to be silent. As Mark Twain once observed, Its better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt. Silence is golden, it is said, and, There is a reason God gave us two ears and only one mouth And yet there are also times for speaking up, and when keeping silent is unethical or cowardly. During World War II, Dietrich Bonhoeffer spoke out against the Nazi regime, saying, Silence in the face of evil is itself evil. During the civil rights movement, Martin Luther King, Jr., likewise said, In the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends.  In the sacred rhythm of ongoing creation, when is it time to keep silent and when is it time to speak? According to Ecclesiastes, those who learn to make this distinction, and who are mindful in their practices of silence and speaking, are wise.  Now, as we consider todays line from Ecclesiastes, some cautions are in order. There are rhythms of silence and speech, for instance, that dont have to do with wisdom but with things like cultural norms and personal temperament.  Some years ago, I heard a memorable talk about cultural factors in communication. It took place at a gathering of the World Council of Churches, with attendees from around the globe. On the opening night, an Orthodox priest named Michael Oleksa gave us all a primer in cross-cultural communication. There are differences, he said, in the way cultures use rhythms of silence and speech, and what those rhythms are taken to mean.  For instance, he said, in some cultures people talk a lot, and loudly, and using lots of hand gestures. If you are a New Yorker of Italian descent, he said, you are probably used to people speaking in this way, and you probably associate rapid, forceful speech with intelligence and drive, while long silences may make you wonder if the other person is disengaged from the conversation, or perhaps slow-witted.  However, Father Oleksa went on, in the native villages of Alaska in which he lives and works, the exact opposite is true. In native communities, long pauses and slow, thoughtful, considered speech is a sign of wisdom, and anyone who speaks loudly and rapidly is thought to be not only rude, but a fool. What I remember most vividly is how Father Oleksa then acted out a mock conversation between a New Yorker and an Alaska native trying to dialogue about matters of faith at our gathering. It was hilarious! And painful. For lack of awareness of different cultural norms, both parties came away believing that the other was deficient in both intelligence and social grace.  Norms around speaking and silence vary from family to family, as well. In my family, for instance, interrupting each other is considered a form of solidarity. My brother and I once invented a game of finishing each others sentences, to see how in tune with each other we could be and how fast we could do it. If you want to be part of a dinner conversation in my family, you cant wait for a pause in which to speak; you have to jump in and join the fray! I had to learn, as I grew up and sat at other dinner tables, that not every family works that way.  Not only are there varying rhythms of silence and speaking from culture to culture and family to family. Each one of us also has a natural temperament that makes us more comfortable with one rhythm or another. Have you read the bestselling book or heard the TED talks by a woman named Susan Cain, about introverts and extroverts? In a society that tends to overvalue rapid-fire speech and to distrust or dislike periods of silence, she made a splash with the book title Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Cant Stop Talking.ii  The wisdom of Ecclesiastes, in this pluralistic age, includes awareness of different rhythms, and taking them into account in our human situations and judgments of others. But in whatever context of communication we find ourselves, we could all become wiser. When it comes to discernment about a time to keep silence, and a time to speak, what do you notice in the wisest people you know?  Let me lift up three qualities that I notice. See what you think. The first is this: wise people imitate God by not talking all the time. And, like Ecclesiastes, they put the time to keep silence first. In that silence, wise ones listen. They seek to understand, before seeking to be understood. They listen with full attention, without mentally formulating what theyre going to say next, and without checking their cell phone or iPad every three minutes.  Now there are people who need to talk more than they do; they need to understand that communication goes two ways. You speak, I speak, you speak, I speak; we go back and forth. If you just sit there and dont participate, there can be no life-giving rhythm of alternating silence and speech. But most of us could probably stand to speak less and listen more. What was that nursery rhyme we learned in school? A wise old owl lived in an oak. The more he lived, the less he spoke. The less he spoke, the more he heard. Now wasnt he a wise old bird?  What do we hear if we pipe down for a while? We hear the voices of others---not just their words, but their voices: the quaver of insecurity in a loud, demanding voice, the strength in a quiet voice. We hear nuances, and silences between the words. We notice body language: I read somewhere that 80% of communication is actually conveyed nonverbally.  So wise people begin with silence. Heres a second thing. Im sure youve noticed this, too. When they do speak, those who are wise choose their words carefully. Whether they talk a lot or a little, quickly or slowly, they exercise what the Bible calls the discipline of the tongue. We might call it applying a filter. Basically it means pausing before saying, Thats the dumbest idea Ive ever heard, and saying instead, Maybe theres another way to think about this. Some of you may belong to the Rotary Club. Rotarians have a famous four-way test to apply before speaking. You ask: Is it the truth? Is it fair to all concerned? Will it build goodwill and better friendships? And: Will it be beneficial to all concerned? A similar test is to ask yourself: Is it true? Is it kind? And: Is it necessary?  Just think of all the hard feelings and negative energy around us that could be eliminated by these filters! They sound like our second reading for today, from Ephesians: Let no evil talk come out of your mouths, but only what is useful for building up, as there is need, so that your words may give grace to those who hear.  I thought about that this week during the televised debate between would-be Republican candidates for President. At one point I turned the sound off so I could consider the nonverbal communication going on: who appeared to be pugnacious, short-tempered, and defensive? Who seemed more thoughtful, mature, and, wellpresidential? That is: who were the wisest ones in that group?  Which brings me to a final observation. The wisest people I know give the impression of speaking out of a stillness at their center, a quiet place in which they are at home with themselves, in touch with God, and hospitable to the voices of others.  Do you remember how Jesus said that its not what goes into a persons mouth thats important, but what comes out, for, as he said, what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart? That is to say: your words and silences will naturally flow from your core character. If you are kind at heart, kind words will come out of your mouth. If you are mean-spirited, even if youre a good actor, there will be unguarded moments when meanness spews from your lips.  Which means that the best way to attend to your communication with others is to go deeper. Cultivate a life of prayer and self-reflection before God. There you will develop the inner strength and freedom that Jesus was pointing to when he said, Let your yes be yes and your no be no. There you can listen to the promptings of the Spirit, so that when you do engage in conversation it will be of the sort that the writer of Ephesians calls speaking the truth in love.  For in fact, people respond much more to what you mean that what you say, anyway. Over the years as a pastor, Ive come to realize: if you love people and they know it, even if you fumble for words, theyll interpret what you say in a positive light. If at your core you dont love them, you may be the most articulate person in the world, but it wont matter. I think of the adage, They won't care what you know, until they know that you care. I would add that nowhere is this more important than when talking about matters of faith, and when sharing with others how the gospel of Jesus Christ has meant life for you.  There is a time to keep silence and a time to speak, a rhythm as old and deep as creation. Would you be wise? Take into account cultural, familial, and personal differences. Seek first to understand, and then to be understood. Choose your words carefully, applying a filter. And speak from a heart that is centered and grounded in the love of God.  Amen.  i For this imagery, thanks to a beautiful article about silence in worship by Cornelius Plantinga, Jr.: A Rhythm as Old as the Word: A Time to Be Silent, a Time to Speak, which first appeared in Reformed Worship: Resources for Planning and Leading Worship, and can be read on-line at http://network.crcna.org/worship/rhythm-old-world-time-be-silent-time-speak. ii Susan Cain, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Cant Stop Talking (New York: Random House, 2012) "
081615tx,"A Time to Throw Away Stones, a Time to Gather Stones Together EUMC 8-16-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James For Everything a Season VI texts: Ecc. 3:1-8 & Heb. 11:8-16  People often speak of the spiritual life as a journey. You and I are on our own individual journeys. The Bible chronicles the communal spiritual journeys of the ancient Hebrews and the early Christians. We might even describe the whole human race as being on a spiritual journey through time.  As todays reading from Hebrews puts it, all of us are traveling toward a vision of what we know life could be, and should be, on this planet. Its a vision of personal peace and fulfillment, as well as peace and abundance for all. This vision---of people living in harmony with each other and with all creation---forms the horizon toward which we travel. We yearn toward it, what the writer of Hebrews calls our spiritual homeland, and what Jesus called the kingdom of God.  As we travel this journey, individually and together, we mark milestones along the way. Have you been out hiking, here in the Pacific Northwest, and come upon a pile of stacked stones, largest on the bottom and smallest on top? They are called cairns or stone stacks. They are usually intended to mark a juncture on the journey, and to point the way for fellow travelers.  The impulse to stack stones as markers for the spiritual journey is very old. When the ancient Hebrews crossed the Jordan River into the Promised Land, they marked that place with a stack of twelve stones. They did this, as the Book of Joshua records: that this may be a sign among you, when your children ask in time to come, What do these stones mean? you shall tell themi about how God liberated their people from slavery, and led them to freedom.  We see the same in the biblical story of Jacob. As Jacob was heading into the unknown territory of a new land, he slept and dreamt of a ladder that connected heaven and earth, with messengers of light ascending and descending all around him. When he awoke, he said, Surely the Lord was in this place---and I didnt know itii He erected stones to mark that site as a special place in his spiritual journey, and to point the way for others, too.  Over time, places of spiritual significance around the world have been marked with stones: think of the stone cairns in Ireland and Scotland, and the stacked stones of native peoples in Alaska. In many places, churches or shrines have been erected on the sites of those ancient stone stacks.  Turn to our line for this morning from the Book of Ecclesiastes: there is a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together. In its most literal sense, this line probably refers to the common practice of clearing stones from a plot of land for agricultural purposes, and then gathering those stones to build walls for the terraced gardens and vineyards of biblical times.  In its figurative sense, however, Ecclesiastes is referring to the spiritual journey. That is: there is a time for dismantling the stone stacks that have marked important junctures in our spiritual journey thus far. A time for sorting, clearing out, and throwing away some of those stones---those beliefs, or ways of being religious that dont serve us well anymore. There is also a time for gathering together the ones we want to keep, as well as new stones. There is a time to build a new stone stack to give direction to the next phase of our journey. James Fowler was director of the Center for Research on Faith and Moral Development until he retired in 2005. Fowler is also a United Methodist minister. He wrote a now-classic book, published in 1981, called Stages of Faith. Based on extensive research, the book describes the typical path of human development in the area of spirituality. We might say that Fowler mapped out the spiritual journey as a developmental process through which people mature over time.  Fowler described six developmental stages of faith.iii In the years since his book was published, others have come up with slightly different schemes---Richard Rohr, for instance, identifies nine stages---but they all follow basically the same trajectory. M. Scott Peck has synthesized the work done to date in this field, and outlines a four-stage process of spiritual development.iv  Pastors learn about these stages of spiritual growth in seminary. But this trajectory should be widely available to everyone. For it provides markers for the spiritual journey, like ancient stone stacks. The stages testify to human experience over time, and point the way forward. So let me walk you through Pecks four stages of spiritual development, based on Fowlers work, in necessarily very abbreviated form, this morning. And as I do, see how it compares with your own spiritual journey, or that of other people you know.  Stage I is a totally undeveloped spirituality. People at this stage are egoistic and lack empathy for others. They may think they are loving---and may even be able to make a good pretense of it---but essentially they are manipulative and self-serving in all their activities and relationships. They tend to be unprincipled, since they have no guiding principles except their own impulses and desires. Their life is chaotic. This is a normal stage for babies, but when adults get stuck there, it becomes problematic. Do you know anyone like this?  But now suppose a Stage I baby is born into a home in which loving parents guide the child. Such a child will gradually internalize the principles of the parents life and faith, acquiring a sense of self-discipline and moral conscience. Not all children are so lucky. Some, lacking an environment thats conducive to spiritual growth, may one day have a sudden conversion experience, and thats how they move to Stage II.  They may reach a point in their lives when they say, The way Im living is self-serving and empty. Ill submit myself to whatever external authority will liberate me from this chaos. Some end up in jail, or other highly structured organizations like the military. But many others submit themselves to the church. For people at this stage, the Church is a refuge and a comfort, telling them what to believe and what to do.  You may have observed that people at Stage II often think of God as a benevolent dictator who loves but whos also willing to use punitive power to enforce Gods will. They often view the Bible as a rulebook for life. Perhaps youve seen the bumper sticker that says: The Bible says it. I believe it. That settles it. Thats a Stage II creed. People at Stage II become attached to the forms of their religion, and become extremely upset when these are called into question. They tend to see the world as divided into good and evil, right and wrong, us and them.  But now suppose a couple of Stage II people get married, and love their children as the church tells them to. The kids go to Sunday School every week. And then, at some normal stage in their growth, usually at adolescence, they have developed enough independence not to want an institution or a rulebook imposing structure on them. They want to think for themselves. And so they cast away the stones of Stage II that they now view as the simplistic or superstitious beliefs of their parents, or of tradition, or what they like to call organized religion. They enter into Stage III of the spiritual journey.  Stage III people dont believe that you have to recite a certain formula, or belong to the right religious organization, in order to be saved. They refuse to take anything on blind faith. They tend to be skeptical, intellectual, scientific, and individualistic. They may become non-religious at this point, and many will stay there permanently. Those who do retain the stones of religious belief move away from the more dogmatic forms of religion, picking and choosing the stones that make sense to them. They often are very ethical, for their own reasons, and involved in social causes---new stones for the stack.  But then---and this is usually gradual---people in Stage III sometimes begin to get glimpses of something more than a world that can be grasped by their own minds. They become increasingly aware of what might be called Mystery with a capital M, connecting all things, making all things one. While retaining skepticism, they perceive grand patterns in nature and develop a deeper understanding of good and evil, forgiveness and mercy, compassion and love. They have entered into Stage IV of the spiritual journey.  People at Stage IV are mystics in the best sense of the word. They understand that truth has many dimensions that have to be held together in paradoxical tension. This is the stage to which Jesus points, what a person looks like when fully grown in terms of spiritual development. Its the stage of loving others as yourself, losing your attachment to your ego, and forgiving your enemies. Its the stage of letting go of tribal gods and embracing a more universal faith.  James Fowler writes, we can describe this stage as one in which persons begin radically to live as though what Christians and Jews call the kingdom of God were already a fact. They experience a shift from the self as the center of experience. Now their center becomes a participation in God or ultimate reality. They're at home with what I call a commonwealth of being. Ecclesiastes would call such people: wise.  Do you recognize yourself at any of these stages? Do they call to mind people you know, or know about? Its exciting, isnt it, to think about all of us being on a spiritual journey, individually and together? A journey that can continue all our lives? And a journey in which there will be times of throwing away stones---letting go of beliefs or attitudes or spiritual states of being that we have outgrown---and times of gathering stones together---both old and new, assembling an ever-more expansive and gracious way of being in the world?  I ask you: what does the world need more than people who are spiritually maturing, growing in their capacity to love God and neighbor? People who are wise, and serving the common good? This is the foundation of all the solutions to the worlds problems. Its the road to abundance and peace, the spiritual homeland, the kingdom of God on earth, for which we yearn.  What could be more important? Amen. i Joshua 4:1-7 ii Genesis 28:10-17 iii See James Fowlers classic book, Stages of Faith: The Psychology of Human Development and the Quest for Meaning (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1976) pp. 270-80, and also his more recent book, Faithful Change: The Personal and Public Challenges of Postmodern Life (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1996) iv See M.

082315tx,"A Time to Sow, a Time to Reap For Everything a Season VI I 8-23-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James EUMC texts: Eccles. 3:1-8 & Acts 5:12-16  For seven weeks now, we have been exploring the famous passage in Ecclesiastes, Chapter 3. You can probably recite it by now. To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven. Then comes a catalog of the various seasons of life, twenty-eight of them arranged in contrast with each other, and each an undeniable part of human existence.  The list begins with what is most fundamentally true: that one day, we are born into this world, and one day we will die. The French composer Hector Berlioz once remarked, Time is a great teacher. Unfortunately, it kills all its pupils. Ecclesiastes would agree, though he might object to the adverb unfortunately. For him, the universe is no doubt unfolding as it should.  Only God knows why existence is ordered the way it is. What we can know is that birth and death, laughing and weeping, gaining and losing----all will happen in every human life. They are life. Life is a flux and flow of time that carries us from one situation to the next, one experience to the next, one season to the next, until eventually we have lived them all.  The measure of a persons life, however, is not how many days or years we live. For Ecclesiastes, it has to do with whether we live life to the fullest as we go along. What do we bring to each moment, and what do we take from it? Do we plumb the depths of each experience and each season, allowing each one to shape and form us? And are we more kind, more just, and more integrated---that is, are we wiser---for having lived through that time?  The wonderful author, Joan Chittister, summarizes the wisdom of Ecclesiastes. This book of the Bible, she says, invites us to see life as a mosaic made up of small pieces common to us all but lived uniquely by each one of us. Finally, the pattern emerges.finally, the truth dawns that life is simply a matter of living from one season to the next, and if we are lucky, learning as we go.  This morning we turn to one last pair of seasons that Ecclesiastes yokes together: a time to sow, and a time to reap. A time to sow: to plant seeds for the future, to dig in and work hard. And a time to reap: to gather in the fruit of our labors, and to celebrate all that has been done.  As we reflect on this line this morning, we are also going to embody it. Because today is a time to reap! This week we come to the end of four and a half years of fruitful ministry through the mobile clinic here at our church, providing free medical care for our neighbors in need. The time is right for this ministry to come to an end---the health care landscape has changed, and many more people now have access to affordable care.  So today we pause to consider all the good that has been done through the clinic: the care given and received, the relationships formed, the faith expressed in loving action. Youll hear more about all of those things this morning. But before I invite Lynn Heitritter to share with us, I want to express deep thanks, on behalf of the whole congregation, to Lynn, and Ron, and all of you who have been part of the mobile clinic ministry.  A ministry of this magnitude doesnt happen without leaders who do the hard and hidden work of sowing. Lynn, as Site Coordinator, and Ron, as Chaplain and truck driver, have been those leaders. Theyve worked tirelessly---Lynn alone has clocked more than 12,000 volunteer hours! Their extraordinary leadership and determined faithfulness have inspired everyone around them. Lynn and Ron, would you please stand and receive our deep thanks and appreciation? (clap)  If you would, please remain standing. Additional thanks will be expressed in this service, but let me now acknowledge some others who have contributed to this vital ministry. And if you are here at this service would you also please stand and remain standing, and we will hold our applause until the end.  Pete and Marilyn Limberopoulos, of the Rusty Pelican Restaurant, have provided free lunches to all the clinic staff once a month for four years!  Members of the Daybreakers Rotary Club have made multiple donations, especially for much-needed diabetic supplies.  Volunteers have served as doctors, nurses, cooks, schedulers, Stephen ministers, and in a host of other ways. Patients have helped to make this a community of mutual care and commitment. So at this time I want to invite anyone here at this service who has been involved in the clinic in any way, including all former and current mobile clinic staff and patients, to please stand.  We thank God for each one of you. As a congregation, we have become kinder, more just, and wiser through this season of our life together. Will you all please join me in expressing our love and appreciation? [all clap] You may be seated.  Now I invite Lynn to share her reflections, as we continue to mark this time of reaping, celebrating, and gathering in.  "
083015tx_tomquigley,"Matters of the Heart Edmonds United Methodist Church August 30, 2015 Sermon by Rev. Tom Quigley James 1: 17-27 and Mark 7: 1-8, 14-15, 21-23  I remember following the story, a few years ago, about a 53 year old man known as Jon Doe who woke up in Discovery Park, not knowing who he was, how he got there, or where he was from, and not able to remember very much at all about his past, other than some vague memories about having been married, having taught at several prominent universities and aware that he had a lot of knowledge about European cultural history. He didnt have a drivers license or any ID, although he did have $600 in cash hidden in his sock. He didnt know his name or anything about his recent past, but he was pretty articulate as he spoke to police, doctors, hospital officials, and to the press, telling them that he wasnt sure he even wanted to know about his life or his past. Even after he was recognized by a Seattle Times reader in China, who remembered him in Shanghai, and was told that his name was Edward Lightheart, and that he had spent some time recently in Canada and then at a sisters home in Las Vegas, he said that he preferred the name Jon Doe. Thanks, anyway, he said. I think Ill stick with Jon Doe and try to create a new identity for myself, rather than claiming my old one.  Todays gospel reading from Mark is also about identity. It tells the story of a time when Jesus and his disciples were moving about the Galilee region of northern Israel, preaching and teaching, when some scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem decided to come north and find out more about this young teacher who they heard was drawing crowds and stirring up the people. They came looking for an opportunity to confront or perhaps embarrass Jesus, perhaps to slow him down or to create some suspicion among the common people. Sure enough, as soon as they arrived, they noticed that the disciples, hungry and thirsty from their morning work, gathered quickly around the lunch tables and began to reach for and devour the food and drinks that had been set out for them. The scribes and Pharisees noticed that they ate their food without first washing up; without thoroughly washing their hands in the traditional way of the Jewish elders.  Jesus was their leader, so the Pharisees singled him out and confronted him about it. Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands? they asked. Not really a question for information, we can imagine, but one filled with accusation.  From what happened next, I have a hunch that this might have been a day when Jesus had had a bad morning. Maybe he had been interrupted too many times and didnt get done what he had planned to do that morning. Maybe he was hungry and thirsty too, and thought he was going to be able to eat some good food, enjoy some privacy, or some peace and quiet, or maybe even some diversion, sharing some jokes or funny parables with his friends. Instead, here were these uninvited high and mighties from down south, from the Big City, just itching for a chance to ruin his day. Well, Jesus pretty much exploded! Went straight for the jugular of those high and mighties, quoting from the prophet Isaiah, no less. He called the scribes and Pharisees hypocrites and blasted them with a passage in Isaiah: This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me; in vain do they worship me, teaching human precepts as doctrine.  And then instead of calming down, he escalated; he stood on a table and got the passing crowds attention. Listen to me, he said, and understand this! There is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile.  Some in the crowd probably said Huh? What do you mean by what comes out of a person? Is this really about washing hands? Or what? And Jesus then gives this list of what he calls the evil intentions that come from the heart  fornication, theft, murder, adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, folly. Quite a list, dont you agree?  Well, here and elsewhere in the Gospels, the Pharisees seem to get a pretty bad rap. And that has had some terrible implications for human history. Jesus explosion at these Pharisees and at the traditions of the elders that they talked about, was often used in Christian history to criticize and ostracize the Jews  hypocrites was a word that later went beyond the Pharisees to include the whole of the Jewish people, and that led to anti-semitism, hatred, and, as we know, some very terrible atrocities.  I think its important, though, before we jump to some conclusions about this incident, to take another look at who the Pharisees were. Contemporary scripture scholars are helping us understand the Pharisees. I understand the belief now is that there were about 4,000 of them around Jesus time, and that they actually represented and were leading a significant and for the most part positive reform movement within Judaism. Their approach was to encourage a return to certain historic traditions of the people of Israel, as a way of helping the community to remember and claim their unique identity, especially as they tried to survive and retain their culture as a minority in an increasingly complex and diverse world. They were, as the Christians later were, in danger of losing their identity, of taking on so many of the characteristics of the surrounding culture that they forgot who they were.  Its not unlike what has happened to the Native American people, the First Peoples of the Pacific Northwest  or what many fear is happening to refugee or immigrant communities today as they become more and more integrated into American society. As the second and third generations of people from Korea or from the Pacific Islands settle into American culture, they too are in danger of losing or forgetting their culture, their heritage, their identity.  Concerns about American identity  what does it mean to be an American? - are becoming increasingly significant in our national political campaigns this year, as some of the candidates for President play into the fears and ignorance of the American people around what to do about the eleven million immigrant persons who are living among us without proper documents. Not only does the future of one of our historic political parties appear to be at risk because of the outlandish positions of several of its candidates, but the basic American commitment to forge an identity that embraces our pluralism is now being challenged by some who are wishing to become our leader. As Thomas Friedman wrote this week, though, pluralism is the very secret of our saucethat out of many we make one.  We see that concern about identity today among Christian communities as well, in both positive and negative forms. Many national churches in the United States, including the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, have had major debates and made crucial decisions in their churchwide gatherings in recent years about ordaining gay and lesbian persons, about allowing them to serve in parish ministry and about permitting pastors to perform same sex marriages. They were making decisions about who they were, and therefore who was on the inside and who was on the outside. This congregation has engaged in a similar debate over the last number of years about how to be and become fully inclusive of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. Our decision earlier this summer to become a Reconciling Congregation was a decision about our public identity, but it was also part of a continuing process of defining or re-defining the identity of this congregation within our regional and national church. Meanwhile that whole debate continues in full force across the United Methodist Church, and it will for several more years.  Apparently one reason that groups feel a need to have a definitive identity is so that they can more easily decide who is in and who is out  to decide the lines in the sand which will determine who is included and who is excluded.  So maybe that is a clue for why Jesus was in such a snit that day  and why he came down so hard on the Pharisees.  I actually dont think that Jesus was speaking up for not washing your hands before you eat. Even in his day, it was probably a good idea to wash the dust off before sitting at the table. And in our day, it is certainly a good idea to wash your hands before you eat. Just ask the Centers for Disease Control or one of those TV doctors on the network news programs. They say that the best way to avoid bad things happening is to wash your hands with soap, often, especially before you touch your mouth.  I also dont think I agree with Jesus when he says it doesnt matter what you put into your body, its what comes out that matters. Wrong, Jesus. Just ask my doctor. It does matter what you eat, he tells me  cut back on your carbs, reduce your sugar intake, dont eat so much bread, eat more fiber and fruit and vegetables and beans. And, while youre at it, lose some weight too.  Actually Jesus probably agreed with the Pharisees efforts at reform anyway. Remember, he was a good Jew. He knew the dangers of losing identity in an occupied territory of the Roman Empire and in the tremendously diverse Mediterranean world.  So maybe this was just one of those times when people were just talking past each other. Weve all had that experience, I suppose, when we were just not talking about the same thing, even though we were arguing strenuously.  The Pharisees were saying that it is really important to maintain the purity of the community, and in that way retain a distinct identity that preserves the culture of the ancestors.  Jesus was trying to make the point that when the struggle to retain the identity of the group gets in the way of the communitys true mission  feeding the poor, caring for the widows and orphans  well, then you have gone too far. For Jesus, mission trumps purity. for I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink; I was a stranger and you welcomed me; I was in prison and you visited me; I was naked and you gave me clothing; I was sick and you took care of me (because) just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me  When asked to boil it all down, Jesus went to the heart of the matter and taught us that the way to maintain your identity and your integrity is to remember to love God and love your neighbor. It is as simple and as complex as that. "
090615tx,"EUMC Blessing of Backpacks Sunday Sermon Jennifer McLaughlin September 6, 2015  Matthew 5:14-16 Let me tell you why you are here. Youre here to be salt-seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth Heres another way to put it: Youre here to be light, bringing out the God-colors in the world. God is not a secret to be kept. Were going public with this, as public as a city on a hill. If I make you light-bearers, you dont think Im going to hide you under a bucket, do you? Im putting you on a light stand. Now that Ive put you there on a hilltop, on a light standshine! Keep open house; be generous with your lives. By opening up to others, youll prompt people to open up with God, this generous Father in heaven. Becoming a parent was one of the best things to ever happen to me. This child was born and my life was changed. This little being emerged into the world, utterly dependent on me for nourishment, for relief, for life. Those of you who are not parents may remember the feeling of falling in love with a niece or nephew, or a brother or a sister. We experience this even when we baptize children in church. We see this baby or toddler and our hearts warm. We cant help but love them and want to cheer for the little ones. Then these little children grow - so quickly they grow. We watch in wonder at their achievements, the acts of kindness, and the unique nature of this human being. We want them to thrive. As they get older, they begin to wonder, who am I? Am I enough? What is the point of all this anyway? And, if its true that God made me, why me? What is it God has in store for me? What unique gift do I have to offer? You may wonder these same things - or you may remember wondering these things. The God that created us, knows us so well. God knows these very questions, and has given us an answer in scripture to these deep questions we wrestle with throughout life. Whats the point of my life? Who am I? What do I have to offer? Eugene Peterson is a theologian who wrote a paraphrase of the Bible and his version of Matthew 5 answers those questions, Youre here to be salt-seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth Heres another way to put it: youre here to be light, bringing out the God-colors in the world. Youre here - youre alive to be God-flavors. God-colors. What is that really? When I was a kid, my favorite toy was a light bright. I brought one in today for one of the kids to play with. I loved creating patterns and designs that were full of light filled color. When I read this text, I pictured a light bright - these lights filled with different colors creating a beautiful image. I love this image of us being God-colors. (PAUSE) Notice that in the light bright there are lots of colors. Each color is important individually. Each light needs to shine, but, do not shine alone. All of these lights shining their God-colors together give us an image of God. If all the lights were orange, it wouldnt look as spectacular as it does with all the different colors working together to make a fantastic image. Look with me at one of the lights. I want you to imagine that this light is you. This light inside of you has a voice. Close your eyes with me for a moment. Picture this light inside you. And ask that light inside of you, what is your deepest fear? What gets in the way of you being you? What old wounds are your carrying? Lets give some attention for a moment to these fears or wounds. Now, ask yourself, what do you need? You can open your eyes again. Now, listen to the rest of this text, If I make you light-bearers, you dont think Im going to hide you under a bucket, do you? Im putting you on a light stand. Now that Ive put you there on a hilltop, on a light standshine! (PAUSE) Notice how the light inside you is feeling. It may feel afraid. It may feel anxious. Thats okay. But I want your light to hear this. You are enough. You are accepted. You are loved. In fact - God loves you so much and is so proud of you that God wants to show you off like a star shining on top of a hill at Christmas. I dont mean to scare you. :) What if the church were actually a school? I dont mean a school for learning facts, but a school that teaches our heart, soul, and mind about who we really are. Imagine that every time you came to church, you could bring the anxiety that you carry and have it be transformed into love. Picture Super-Hero meets the movie Inside-Out. You now have the super power to change fear into love. Do you think that is possible? I believe that is what God wants to do for us. God takes our anxieties and heals them so that we can shine our imperfect selves into this world and let people see the gorgeous God-colors in us. One of the ways God does this is through Sabbath. When we rest God heals us and releases us from our fears, freeing us to love and shine our God-colors. God-color looks like all sorts of different people with different strengths and different struggles sharing love with one another. It looks like people no longer afraid to follow their dreams. It looks like people that are free to be themselves - no matter what mistakes theyve made. It looks like people who love and accept one another - even if their color makes the other person uncomfortable. Its hard to do this with other people. We meet a new friend and they seem so great. Then you get to know them better and see their flaws. They make mistakes. Were disappointed. It takes work to love and accept them without needing to change them. Accepting ourselves is even harder! My favorite thing about the Bible is that its full of stories of imperfect people who are loved by God anyhow. Theres Noah. God loved Noah and had big plans for him. He built the Ark and saved animals and people from the flood. But Noah had a drinking problem and one night he ends up drunk and naked embarrassing himself in front of his family. Theres Moses. Moses was the baby found in the Nile river who was raised by the Pharoah. God then called Moses to stand up for all the people enslaved by Pharoah. But Moses - he had a stuttering problem. He was terrified and wanted God to call someone else! I love the story of Rahab. Hers is a unique story. Its not often in the Bible that you hear about a woman who is called by name. But Rahab was important. She acted like a spy and helped hide the people of God so they would be safe. God blessed Rahab. She became the mother of Boaz who married Ruth and is a great, great, great grandmother to Jesus (not sure how many greats are in there, but you get the idea). Jesus came from Rahab. She was important. But you know what - Rahab was a prostitute. She made some bad choices. But God loved her and used her anyways! When God called me to use my life for God, I was scared. The thought of getting up in front of people terrified me. I kind of liked the idea of it but I was so nervous. I have a condition called Essential Tremor, that makes my hands shake. I thought - how could I ever talk in front of people? Id just be nervous all the time. Yet, God had a plan for me. I still am learning how to not let my fears get in the way. God takes our weaknesses and uses us to show the God-colors and flavors to the world. So, I wonder about you. I wonder how God wants to use you. I wonder what your gifts are that God wants to put in the light. And I wonder - what do you need to feel empowered to let your God-colors shine? What would it take for you to be free to be the person God made you to be? Hopefully you received two little pieces of paper when you came in. I want you to take out those pieces of paper now. Take the first piece of paper and write down what you need so that you can let your God-colors shine. It might be one word, or it may be longer. I wonder what you need. Is it forgiveness, hope, faith, courage, peace, compassion? Maybe you need a hug. Reflect for a moment and then write down what YOU need. Likewise, I wonder if you might be carrying any old JUNK that gets in the way of you shining your light. What trash might you be carrying that you need to clean out of your backpack so you are ready for a fresh start? I wonder if its fear, self-hate, prejudice, pride, or cutting. Take the second piece of paper. Picture that light inside you again. What does that little light need to be free from in order to shine? Write that down. Today is Blessing of the Backpack Sunday. In the narthex, we have a table set up with lots of backpacks and books. After worship, I want you to take your word that you need this year and put it in a backpack. Then I want you to take the word you need to be free from and place that in the basket under the table. God made you and has a purpose for you. I wonder what that is. I wonder how God wants you to shine this year at school, at work, in your homes, in your friendships. Remember the baby we talked about at the start? Its easy to love that little child. Lets offer some of that love to the child within us and open our hearts to God so that we can shine our God-colors in our world. Our world desperately needs to see the light in you. And God wants you to be YOU so that we can enjoy all of the flavors - all the God-colors that God made! And all Gods, people said, Amen. "
091315tx_nosmallthing,"No Small Thing a sermon preached at EUMC Homecoming Sunday 9-13-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: *Luke 14:15-24 & Revelation 19:9-10  Ive recently come to embrace the word, yall. Im trying to incorporate it into my everyday vocabulary.  I grew up in Southern California. My family didnt use this word. We wouldnt have even known of it except for the occasional Western movie on TV. Do you remember how, at the end of the TV show called The Beverly Hillbillies, the grandma sat in her rocking chair on the porch, waving good-bye? My little sister would sit on the floor in front of the TV, enthusiastically waving back. The theme song of that show always ended with the character named Ellie Mae saying, Yall come back now, yhear?  The word yall comes from the American South. Its actually very functional: it clears up the distinction we have, in the English language, between you singular, and you plural. It also allows for emphasis on the plural when you double it up, as in the wonderful Southern expression: All yall. If I say, All yall are invited to the Homecoming feast after church today, that means that all of you, without exception, and your friends and family too, are warmly invited to come.  I wish the scholars who translated our Bible into English had had these distinctions at their disposal. Because without them, we can miss the fact that when the English word you appears in our Bible, more often than not, the pronoun in the original Hebrew or Greek is in the plural form. The you in our Bible is almost always a plural yall.  So, for instance, in Exodus, we read, you shall be for me a priestly kingdom. It does not say, you, as an individual, are to be a deeply spiritual person, or these words are just for you, Moses. The you is in the plural form. And Deuteronomy repeatedly says, you are to be holy to the Lord your God. The calling to holy living isnt issued only to individuals, but to a people, a community.  The frequent use of the plural you continues in the New Testament. For instance, when Jesus says, You are the light of the world, the Greek pronoun is plural, so it means: you all, the community of my followers---are to carry on the work that I came to do. Not you the individual, but yall---the collective you---are to be light in a darkened world, making Gods love visible and believable to others.  Turn to our gospel reading for this morning. Jesus is telling a parable about the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom of God, you remember, is a shorthand phrase for that time and place, wherever it may be, that Gods intent for human life is fulfilled. The parable begins: A man once gave a great banquet, and invited many Have you ever noticed how many stories Jesus told that involve meals? The gospels are filled with stories about eating and drinking because it was believed that when the Kingdom comes, when Gods will is done on earth as it is in heaven, it will be like a great banquet, and all the worlds people, all yall will be there celebrating.  and at the time for the dinner party, he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, Come, for everything is ready now. But they all began to make excuses  I just bought some real estate, and I have to go see it. I just bought some oxen, and Im going to try them out. I just got married; please accept my regrets. My kids have soccer practice. Thats the only day of the week I get to sleep in! Theres a football game on TV. (Im meddling now, arent I?) In other words: I have my own life to live. I cant come to a party right now. I have my own individual goals and interests to pursue.  Hearing these excuses, the host becomes angry. Is it really such a radical, counter-cultural idea that people might come together to worship Someone other than themselves? That they might gather, even just once a week, to be reminded that they---and their own needs and preferences---are not the center of the universe?  The man says to his servant, Well, I still want this banquet to take place. So go out and beat the bushes until you find enough guests to fill my house. Go out into the roads and the lanes, inviting everyone you meet: the blind, the poor, strangers, everyone who is not too wrapped up in their own concerns to come. And the parable ends on this note, with this image of the Kingdom of God: a new community of friends and strangers, gathered together in the masters house, having a party, sharing a feast.  You see, community isnt just a convenient arrangement suggested by the Bible for the working out of our individual salvation. Its the great commission in the vast majority of biblical texts, including todays parable. The gospel of Gods love for all people, revealed in Jesus Christ, becomes visible and real only when it is incarnated in the way Christians actually live together. People are supposed to be able to look at us, a community of Christs disciples, and get a glimpse of the heavenly banquet, the Kingdom of God, a way of life that holds up hope for the world.  In a book entitled Call to Conversion, Jim Wallis offers a revealing description of the early Christian church:  They were known as the people of the Way. More than just individuals who had been converted, they were now a people, a new community which had embarked together on a new way of life. .The Word was not only announced but seen in the community of those who were giving it fleshHere love was given daily expression. People were no longer divided into Jew and Gentile, slave and free, male and female. In this community the weak were protected, and the stranger welcomed. People were healed; the poor and dispossessed were cared for and found justice. Everything was shared, joy abounded, and ordinary lives were filled with praise.i  It sounds like a banquet, doesnt it? A feast. Contemporary writer Anne Lamott puts it differently. But a paragraph in her popular book, Traveling Mercies, calls to mind accounts of early Christianity. Listen to her explanation of why she makes her ten-year-old son go to church:  The main reason is that I want to give him what Ive found in the world, which is to say a path and a little light to see by. Most of the people who have what I want---which is to say, purpose, heart, balance, gratitude, joy---are people with a deep sense of spirituality. They are people in community, who pray, and practice their faith, people banding together to work on themselves and for human rights. They follow a brighter light than the glimmer of their own candle; they are part of something beautiful Our funky little church is filled with people who are working for peace and freedom, who are out there on the streets and inside praying. They are home writing letters, and they are at the shelters with giant platters of food.ii  I dont have to tell you that we live in a world that can be deeply troubling. Open the newspaper or turn on the evening news, and a litany of terrible things scrolls out: streams of refugees fleeing the violence in Syria, a three-year-old child face down on the beach. Hatred, war, poverty, corruption, kidnappings, murder, mayhem, fires, and floodsIts tempting, in the face of such things, to give in to feelings of helplessness and defeat.  What can you and I do? Its tempting to stay home, wrap ourselves in tight cocoons, and tend to our own individual affairs. What does it really matter, after all, if we gather here and try to respond to Gods call to be a holy people? In the face of all that is going on in the world, just being the church seems like such a small thing.  Butis it really a small thing that, as disciples of Christ, we are seeking to be a genuinely caring community? One in which children are cherished, elders are honored, and all people are treated as persons of sacred worth? Is it a small thing that we express this care in daily, concrete ways, like making casseroles, sending notes, knitting prayer shawls, and simply being there for one another? I think of other parables Jesus told about the Kingdom of God, about how small things can make a big difference: a mustard seed, a lump of yeast, a pinch of salt.  Ask the woman whos living with cancer whether its a small thing to have church friends accompany her to her chemo appointment every week. Or the man in a nursing home whether it matters that church folks come regularly to visit him. Or the woman who came to us through the mobile health clinic and who is receiving a new leg brace---as a result of your generosity---and will soon be able to walk without pain for the first time in years.  And is it such a small thing that we seek, in this community, to help people grow spiritually? Through Sunday School and our Childrens Center, we teach children that they are precious to God, and to us. We impart values and share the stories of our faith. Through youth ministries and mission trips, we give young people experiences that will shape the rest of their lives. Through ChristCare groups, classes and retreats, we encourage each other to reflect on our faith and live our lives more fully in the light of Gods grace, revealed in Jesus Christ.  I ask you: is there anything this world needs more than people who are growing in their capacity to love God and neighbor? And is it a small thing that, in the course of our life together, this community becomes a living laboratory where we are continually challenged to stretch our abilities to accept each other, forgive each other, and speak the truth in love? Its sometimes said, If human beings can learn to resolve our conflicts, we will someday be able to live in community. But I think that might be backwards. Perhaps if human beings can learn to live in community, we will someday be able to resolve our conflicts. i From The Call to Conversion, by Jim Wallis, San Francisco : Harper & Row, 1981, pp. 13-15 ii From Traveling Mercies, by Anne Lamott, New York: Random House, 1999, p. 100 Then this. Given all the pain in this world, is it a small thing that in this community, we try to reach out to our neighbors in need? Over 1500 people a week receive food through our food bank. We tutor at-risk school children and serve dinner to their families every week. We offer emergency shelter in cold weather, and provide Christmas gifts to families in need through our Toy Shop. We host recovery and support groups, contribute to global missions and disaster relief, advocate for social changeand the list goes on. I wonder. Isnt love in action, on a human scale, exactly what our surrounding society needs to see?  And soon, through the proceeds of the property sale we are celebrating today, we will be seeking out more ways to make Gods love visible and real to others. Ideas are circulating: shall we convert our parsonage to a center for justice and peace? Or a transitional house for the homeless? Provide infant and toddler care for struggling families? Should we plan to adopt and help some Syrian refugees begin a new life? I encourage you all to be thinking and praying and talking about the new ministries that God may be calling and equipping us to undertake. Whatever we do will require champions, and investment of time and energy, as well as money. It will be thrilling to see how this process of discernment unfolds in the months ahead.  But this morning we pause to mark the milestone of this property sale. Because thats another thing that a community of faith does. We mark the milestones of our life together. We baptize babies, dance at each others weddings, help each other through when one among us dies. We laugh and cry together. For God has given us one another to love.  These are not small things. They are the things that matter most in our world! The point of our parable is that creation of community is nothing less than Gods strategy for bringing about the Kingdom of God on earth! On this Homecoming Sunday we gather to worship God, to sing and pray, to greet old friends and new, and to celebrate an important milestone in our life together. There is even a literal feast to share! I have to say it; you know I cant resist:  Yall come!  Amen.              "
092015tx_layyourburdensdown,"Lay Your Burdens Down a sermon preached at EUMC 9-20-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Matthew 11:28-30 & Galatians 6:1-2  Our text for this morning is one of the most beloved passages in Scripture. Its a word of consolation from Jesus, and an invitation. First the consolation: Come unto me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.  A word of solace, and relief. Jesus knows and understands the burdens that we carry. Looking out at you all this morning, I know just some of what you carry, and I tell you, its a heavy load. Worries about health, finances, work, family. Sorrows and disappointments from the past. Anxieties about the future. Loneliness, addictions, depression, broken relationships  And the pace of modern life. The relentless demands and responsibilities. I was talking to a clergy colleague the other day. He spoke of the weight of responsibility he feels for the well-being of his church. He pointed to his shoulders, where he carries his tension and stress, and said, There it is. I carry the church right there, all the time. Do you carry your responsibilities there too? On your shoulders, like an ever-present, invisible, heavyyoke?  Jesus knows the burdens of our lives. Come to me, he says, and I will give you rest.  Jesus knows, too, that some of the burdens we carry are self-imposed. Its important for us to note the context of this passage in Matthews gospel. In the chapters leading up to our text, Jesus has been verbally sparring with the Pharisees. The Pharisees, you remember, were highly respected members of society. They were educated teachers and leaders, and religiously devout. They were capable and conscientious. That is to say: they were a lot like most of us.  The biggest problem of the Pharisees was their tendency toward over-responsibility. They strove to be virtuous, to be found worthy in Gods eyes, and in their own eyes. They attempted to live up to rigorous---even impossibly high---standards and obligations. And they insisted that everyone else should try to live up to them, too. In Matthew 23, Jesus says of the Pharisees, They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on the shoulders of others.  Does this sound like anyone you know? Or let me ask this: is it possible that you are loaded down, not just by the external circumstances of your life, and not just by your job and family and other responsibilities, but by something deeperwithin yourself? Something that constantly tells you that you must do more, try harder, be better, to prove yourself worthy? In theological language, this relentless internal pressure is called works-righteousness. One of my favorite preachers, Barbara Brown Taylor, describes her experience of it this way:  I may believe that I live by Gods grace, but I act like a Scout collecting merit badges. I have a list of things to do that is a mile long, and while there are a number of things on the list that I genuinely want to do, the majority of them are things I think I ought to do, that I should do, that Id better do, or God will not love me anymore. I may believe that my life depends on Gods grace, but I act like it depends on me and how many good deeds I can perform, as if every day were a talent show, and God had nothing better to do than keep up with my score.i Theres a certain grandiosity to this way of living, since it assumes that we actually could live up to impossible standards. Theres a certain pathos to it, too. Constantly driving ourselves---however we do it, climbing the career ladder, trying to impress others, trying to be the perfect parent, taking on more jobs at church---all to be pronounced good enough on some scoreboard in the sky, is the most tiring work in the world. And its never done. The goal always goes ahead of us, just out of reach. Do you know this struggle? I do. Its an exhausting way to live. And it leads to the heaviest burden of all: despair.  Jesus has been talking with the Pharisees when he says, Come unto me, all you that are weary and carrying heavy burdens. Hes extending not only consolation, but an invitation to a different way of living. He offers them---offers us---a rest from trying and trying and trying.  I know a woman who tells of a time when she was in the mountains, on a vigorous hike. As she walked down the trail, she was internally in that over-focused, over-industrious mode of being that all Pharisees know: focused on the future, working herself up into a lather of questions, plans, and various imagined eventualities and outcomes. She brought this inner turmoil to God, praying, What do you want me to do---this, that, what?  And then a voice spoke in the depths of her soul. It said, Daughter, stop trying. Just that. Stop trying. In that instant, it was as if Someone had opened her eyes, or cleaned the lenses of her glasses, bringing the world into clearer focus. She saw, suddenly, where she was: in an evergreen forest, with snow on the ground. The air was still. It was beautiful. Pure gift. And she had almost missed it! It was an intervention, really: Stop trying.  Our text goes on. Jesus continues: Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.  Which seems like a mixed message, doesnt it? Stop trying. Come and restby taking up my yoke! It reminds me of the scene in the movie Raising Arizona, where the bumbling bank robber yells, Freeze! Everyone get down on the floor! and a customer says, Well, which one is it? Freeze, or get down on the floor?ii Which one is it, Jesus? Do you want us to stop and rest---finally, blessedly, allow ourselves to rest---or do you want us to take up yet another yoke?  The key, here, is in this concept, yoke. A yoke was a piece of wood that joined together two oxen for pulling a plow or a wagon. As a carpenter, Jesus must have made many yokes. The ox would be brought to the shop, and measurements were taken. The yoke was then roughed out, and the ox was brought back to have it tried on. It was carefully adjusted. Then the wood was sanded smooth so that it wouldnt chafe the animals neck. Like a well-made suit or a well-fitting pair of shoes, the yoke was tailor-made to fit the ox.  And heres the thing: a yoke was made for two animals. It was used to bring the strength of two together, in order to pull a load that was impossible for one to pull alone. Typically a less experienced ox was yoked with a more experienced one, who provided leadership and direction. But both animals worked together to pull the load. They could spell each other through the day, taking turns bearing the brunt of the load. And when the day was done, both were tired but not exhausted, because they had worked together as a team.  Jesus knows that life has its burdens and responsibilities. Taking on his yoke doesnt mean that there will be no more burdens to bear, and no more work to be done. What it means is that the burdens are lighter because they are shared. In the Greek, the word easy in verse 30 has its roots in the word kind. That is to say: Jesus kindly offers to become our yokemate. He invites us to learn how to bear the burdens of life by working beside him. Hes saying that that the heaviness of life will be so much lighter, so much easier, if we share it with him, rather than trying to go it alone.  Barbara Brown Taylor says that we go through all this desperate, panting effort to prove were worthy, while all the time Jesus is standing right in front of us, half of a shared yoke across his own shoulders, the other half wide open, and waiting for us. All he asks is that we join him. Nothing moreor less.  Which means we can lay down the self-imposed burdens we carry, those internal ones that underlie the others. The burden of determining our own self-worth, for instance. We cant do that; only God can do that, and God already has, entirely apart from anything we do. And the burden of self-centeredness, the unspoken but lived-out assumption that our needs and wants take priority over those of others. And the burden of self-sufficiency, the illusion that we really dont need any help to get through life, not from other people and not from God.  I think of the old Shaker tune: Tis a gift to be simple, tis a gift to be freetis a gift to come round where we ought to be. Come to me Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. This is where we ought to be: alongside Jesus, learning from him how to simply live in response to the goodness of God, and to humbly labor for the good of this world that God loves.  This morning my thoughts turn to a professor I had in seminary, a man named Art. He was tall, had a deep voice, and these great eyebrows that grew all the way across his forehead, in a line. One day, Art told a story. He said that, as he was growing up, his father was extremely demanding. All the children in the family desperately wanted to earn his affection and approval---though none of them really ever could. Arts father set impossibly high standards. The children became high achievers, excelled in school and athletics. But nothing was ever quite good enough to please their father.  All through high school and college, then, Art was this driven, high-performing young man. After that he went to seminary. Art said maybe he had confused God with his father in his mind, and he figured that the best way to earn Gods love, to finally be pronounced good enough, was to become a minister. In seminary, not surprisingly, he earned straight As. Then, one semester, he took a course in preaching.  This was in the days when preaching classes were organized in such a way that each student would take a turn preaching in front of the rest of the class, who would then critique the sermon, i Barbara Brown Taylor, The Open Yoke, The Seeds of Heaven: Sermons on the Gospel of Matthew (Louisville, Kentucky, 2004) p. 19 ii For this allusion to Raising Arizona, thanks to Kory Wilcoxson in Take a Load Off, a sermon preached at Crestwood Christian Church Disciples of Christ, Lexington, Kentucky, July 3, 2011 often harshly. It was an ordeal, standing in front of those critical, competitive classmates. And Art was the most critical and competitive of them all.  One day a student delivered a mediocre sermon. As soon as he sat down, Art led the charge. With his keen mind and clever tongue, he was brilliant. And merciless. As class was ending that day, the professor asked to speak with him privately for a moment. Art was pleased, expecting to be praised. The other students left the room. Then the professor said, What were you doing here today? Art was confused.  The professor answered his own question: You werent trying to help your fellow student. You were tearing him down, tearing him apart, trying to make yourself look good. He went on, Dont you know that you dont need to do that? You dont have to prove anything. Dont you know how good you are?  Art was stunned. The professor went on: You carry your insecurities around like a pack on your shoulders. It weighs you down. It gets in the way in your relationships, and it will get in the way of your ministry.  Art could barely take this in; he was aware that sudden, embarrassing tears were springing to his eyes. Then the professors voice became kind, and he said, Son, you dont need to carry that pack around anymore. Why dont you put it down? Justlay it down.  Art says: I put the pack down. Over the years Ive picked it up again---and Ive had to lay it down again, and again But that day, I got a glimpse of what it would be like to live without it. What it would be like to be free, at ease inside myself, at peace.  Here in worship this morning, what burdens are you carrying? Whats weighing you down, getting in the way of your relationships with other people, and with God? What keeps you from knowing you are loved? What holds you back from living and working alongside Jesus, simply and gladly offering your gifts to the world?  I dont know what your particular burdens are, but you know. Let the rock in your hand symbolize one of them. A self-imposed burden, perhaps. In a few moments, as we sing, you are invited to come forward, as you feel moved, and drop your stone into this shallow bowl on the altar, here at the foot of the cross, and leave it there. Just lay it down, and step into the yoke that is waiting for you, tailor-made for you, so that your life may be simpler, kindlier, lighter.  You dont have to go it alone. You have here a community in Christ. And Christ is here, saying, Come to me, all you who are weary and carrying heavy burdens. Take my yoke upon you, and you will find rest for your souls.  Amen.

100415tx_table_manners,"Table Manners World Communion Sunday at EUMC 10-4-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James text: I Corinthians 11:17-26  Pastors are like people in every other profession: they like to get together and tell stories about the worst things that have happened to them in the course of their work. I know a pastor, for instance, who tells about the time he was conducting a graveside memorial service, and he fell into the open grave. The ground at the edge of the hole gave way, and he slipped right in! Ever since I heard that, whenever I do a graveside service, I watch where I stand.  There are worst-case funeral stories, worst-case wedding stories, even worst-case stories about Holy Communion. Elaine Stanovsky, who is a bishop now, tells of a time when she was presiding at communion at an ecumenical gathering. Some of the participants there, from other denominations, werent even sure whether they could receive communion from a woman. So Elaine was nervous. Which is why, I suppose, her hands were shaking when she lifted the round loaf of bread to give thanks. The bread slipped from her hands and went rolling down the center aisle of the church, like a wheel.  Bruce Parker, a mentor to many of us, used to tell of an incident that took place when he was a young pastor assisting an older pastor in the communion service. At that time, they werent using a whole loaf of bread as we do now, but those flat white wafers that look like paper coins. The wafers were arranged on a paper doily, on a silver plate. Somehow, when the presiding pastor reached for the plate, his hand caught the doily, and the whole plateful of communion wafers flipped onto the floor.  Bruce, who was supposed to be assisting, immediately got down on all fours under the table and started picking them up, while the older minister just kept reading aloud out of the Prayer Book. It was while Bruce was on his hands and knees when he heard the older minister recite, We are not worthy, Lord, even to gather the crumbs beneath your table.  My favorite worst-case scenario, however, comes from Vancouver School of Theology. When I was in seminary there, we had a liturgy professor named David Holeton. David had a long list of things he thought you must do when serving communion: bread at the right height, arms just so. If a student dropped a crumb onto the floor, he made you get down on your knees with your hands behind your back, and pick up the crumbs with your lips. Ive never known anyone who was so concerned that the mechanics of communion be exactly right.  One day, it was Davids turn to preside at communion in the chapel. One of the students had baked the bread, but the problem was: it was brown and crusty on the outside, but not cooked all the way through. David lifted the bread just so, went to break it, and to his horror, the uncooked center held together in one glutinous string! It was like elastic. He finally had to put the loaf under his arm, to tear it in two. Later, when he served the students who came forward in line, he had to twist each piece of dough from the loaf, and shake his finger to get it off. In our scripture reading for this morning, the apostle Paul is also describing a worst-case scenario of Holy Communion. But in this case, the problem is much worse than rolling bread, flying wafers, or even uncooked dough. Paul is writing to the newly converted Christians in the city of Corinth. He begins with these words: In what I am about to say, I do not commend you.  Then Paul goes on to describe how the Corinthians are taking communion. He says, You gorge yourselves and dont even think of those who are with you at the same meal! He says, What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I shall not. Paul sounds like a parent scolding children about their table manners: Dont talk with your mouth full. Get your elbows off the table. But it goes much deeper than that. This is a problem not just of form---the mechanics of communion, how to do it properly---but of substance, the meaning of communion itself.  Now, it is helpful to know, here, that the Christians in Corinth were Greeks, recent converts from what was called the mystery religions. In the mystery religions, as in the early Christian church, the central act of worship was a sacred meal. But Paul says, This is not the same kind of meal you are used to. Because in the mystery religions, the meal during worship was thought to have magical power. You ate this mystical food, and you were supposed to be transported into a heavenly state. The purpose of the ritual was, literally, for individuals to get high, to achieve an altered state of consciousness.  The Greeks had a word for this, ekstasis, from which we get our word, ecstasy. Worshippers in the mystery religions figured that the more you eat, the more ecstatic you get, so they gorged themselves. When they converted to Christianity, they brought this concept with them. They assumed that Holy Communion, the sacred meal of the Christ-followers, worked the same way. But Paul says to them, Youve got it all wrong. And then he describes the nature of this meal.  The essence of Communion, Paul says, is remembrance. When we take communion, we remember the Last Supper, when Jesus took the bread and cup, passed them to his disciples, and said, These represent what Im about to do for you. In other words, we remember how Jesus gave himself, in life and in death, for us.  Later on in his letter, Paul is explicit about what this means. He says, God was in Christ, reconciling the world to God, and calling us to be ministers of reconciliation. The point of communion, then, is not for a bunch of individuals to have some ecstatic spiritual experience. The point is for people to come together, be reconciled with God and one another, and be sent out as Christs ministers of reconciliation in this world.  Paul says: therefore, when you come together to take communion, dont worry too much about things like whether the bread is thoroughly cooked, or whether you accidentally drop it---those are superficial things. Worry about the state of your heart before God, and your relationships with others. If you want to celebrate communion rightly, focus on the things that make for community: like justice, and peace.  Paul lays it right out: I hear that when you take communion, each one goes ahead with your own meal, while another goes hungry. What?! Do you despise the church of God, and humiliate those who have nothing?  Im reminded of a church dinner that I once attended, years ago. You arrived at this dinner, and you were immediately escorted to a table. But after you sat down, and looked around the room, you noticed that something was terribly wrong.  One table, in the center of the room, was beautifully set with candlesticks and fine china, ready for a five-course meal. But that was the only table like that, in the whole room. Nearby were others set with plastic plates, ready for a meal of cafeteria-style food: greasy and starchy, but abundant. But then there were others (many others) that were bare except for one bowl at each place, ready for one serving of rice or soup. And finally, there were several tables that were completely bare. People who had the misfortune to be seated at those tables spent the evening watching their neighbors eat.  The dinner was meant to help us viscerally experience the actual distribution of wealth and poverty in this world, a world in which one out of eight people---half of them children---goes to bed hungry every night. It was an important experience for my family---my children were young at the time---because you know, we always sat down to plenty of nourishing food. And I believe that if one of the worlds hungry children came and stood by our table, then or now, we wouldnt think of not sharing our food. Can you imagine dishing out heaping plates of food for your own family, and turning to that hungry child, and saying, None for you!?  And yet, you and I do it every day. Its just that that child isnt standing right there at our table, looking with longing at our plates. That child is eating pop-tarts and Kool-aid in an apartment in Lynnwood, or a scant bowl of rice somewhere in Asia, or languishing in a refugee hospital in Africa, or dying on the streets in India.  The point is: when Christians come together around one table, especially today, on World Communion Sunday, we are supposed to remember that Jesus lived and died for all Gods children, everywhere in the world. We are supposed to renew our commitment to work for a world in which bread is shared, and everyone is fed. For you cannot gorge yourself in front of your hungry brothers and sisters, as the Corinthians did, and expect peace.  Which is the second thing that Paul points out. He says, I hear that, when you assemble as a church, there is no peace among you, but factions and divisions. In this, he says, you are making a mockery out of communion. In fact, if you come to the table with resentments or hatred in your heart, he says, It is not the Lords Supper that you eat.  Throughout Christian history, there have been theological debates about communion. The debates have focused mostly on the elements: do the bread and wine actually become the body of Jesus Christ? Or only symbolically? And when, exactly, does the transformation take place?  Pauls answer would be this. Youre focusing on the wrong things! This is not a mystery religion. The miracle of communion doesnt happen when the elements of bread and wine change into some kind of mystical, magical food.  The miracle of communion happens when people come to God, with all their flaws and failings, in the midst of an unjust and brutal world, and are reconciled with one another. It happens when you walk into a church and see the Roman master freely serving the slave, a church where there are no reserved seats, and no empty bowls, and where, as Paul writes, There is no Jew nor Greek, no slave nor free, no male nor female, but all are one in Christ Jesus.  Its not whats on the altar that becomes the mystical Body of Christ. Its the congregation, gathered together around one table, that becomes the Body of Christ in this world.  Do you ever sit, during worship in this church, and watch people coming forward to receive communion? Sometimes, as people come forward, I find myself suddenly all choked up. And Im not even sure why, except that I know it has something to do with bringing to God our deep yearnings for justice and peace and reconciliation. It has to do with people from all walks of life holding out our hands for bread, acknowledging our common dependence on God, and our need for each other. There is something about taking communion together that makes a fierce tenderness toward all people rise like a lump in the throat.  May God bless the worldwide communion of the church this day.  Amen.  "
101815tx_how_long_childrens_sabbbath,"How Long, O Lord, Must I Cry to You for Help? Childrens Sabbath EUMC 10-18-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Habakkuk 1:1-4, 2:1-5 & Matthew 18:1-6  A clergy friend tells about a woman in his congregation who was dying. As the woman lay in a hospital bed, her adult daughter sat in the chair beside her. The daughter was holding her hand and saying what was on her heart. At one point she said, You were such a good mother to me!  At that, her mother opened her eyes and declared, I still am your mother!  Thats a bit how I am feeling this morning. Since the announcement was made this past week that I will be retiring in June, I have received gracious words of appreciation from many of you. Thank you so much for your calls and e-mails! You are the most loving congregation.  At the same time.this morning I want to say: I still am your pastor! We have nine more months together! And we have more vital ministry to do!  Turn to our text for today. It comes from the Hebrew prophet Habakkuk, who lived seven centuries before the birth of Christ. Like all biblical prophets, Habakkuk cries out in lament and protest over all the injustice in this world. As our text begins, he is calling out to God, saying, O Lord, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not listen? Or cry to you Violence! and you will not save? Why do you make me see wrong-doing and look at trouble?  Its a familiar cryin every age. People of faith perceive how far off we are from what God intends for our life together, and wonder why injustice and poverty exist. The prophets cry comes to our lips today, on this Childrens Sabbath, as we consider the plight of children in our world, our nation, and here in our own community.  Consider the following statistical snapshot of children and poverty in America:  . Every 34 seconds, in our country, a baby is born into poverty. . Every 47 seconds a child is abused or neglected. . Every 56 seconds a baby is born without health insurance. . Every 67 seconds a baby is born into extreme poverty. . Every 1-and-a-half minutes a baby is born at low birth weight. . Every 22 minutes a baby dies before his or her first birthday. . Every 3 hours and 15 minutes a child or teen is killed by guns. . Every 5-and-a-half hours a child is killed by abuse or neglect.  Its hard to fathom how all this could be true. How is it that one in five children in the United States, the richest country in the world, lives below the poverty line? The U.S. now has the second highest rate of child poverty among the 35 most advanced economies in the world!i Poor children are hungry, sick, and often homeless. Check out the insert inside your bulletin this morning. Notice that Washington State has 61,000 homeless children! And as Jennifer said earlier, in our own Edmonds School District, there are 312 homeless students, a number thats expected to increase as the school year goes on.ii  If statistics make you glaze over, I invite you to picture in your mind a child who you know, personally. Imagine him getting on the bus in the morning, dizzy with hunger. Imagine her going to school, on these chilly mornings, without a warm coat. Imagine a whole generation of such children looking back someday and realizing that we, their exceptionally prosperous predecessors, were not willing to make the investments necessary to ensure that the next generation could enjoy the same blessings we have known.  Jay Rockefeller, former U.S. Senator and Chairman of the National Commission on Children, says flatly, We are hypocrites. We say we love our children, yet they have become the poorest group in America.iii We are giving them crumbling schools and inadequate health care, not to mention a fouled environment. Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Childrens Defense Fund, says that if compassion werent enough to motivate us to do better by our children, self-interest should be. The inattention to children by our society, she warns, poses a greater threat to our safety, productivity, and harmony than any external enemy.iv  The reality of children in poverty, on a global and national scale---and here in our own community---can bring out the prophet in us. Heartbroken, we lament with Habakkuk: O Lord, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not listen? Faced with the harsh facts, we protest, Why do you make me see wrong-doing and look at trouble?  Again and again in scripture, prophets ask, How long, O Lord? And God, who continues to provide enough resources to meet the basic needs of all Gods children, turns the question back on us: How long, O my people? You tell me. Then God tells the prophet what we must do. Our text in Habakkuk goes on: Then the Lord answered me and said: Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so that a runner may read it. For there is still a vision for the appointed time...  In other words, Habakkuk tells the people: Make the biblical vision of human life as God intends it---including children being fed and cared for---visible to others. Make it plain, so that it can be seen and spread. Or as Gandhi said, Be the change you want to see in the world. Quaker Jim Corbett speaks of what he calls civil initiative. The injustices of this world are resisted most effectively, he says, not by fighting or argument, but by the visible, lived alternative of a community that steadfastly affirms and demonstrates what is holy and good.  The question becomes: how will we make the vision of Gods will so visible that even those hurrying through their daily routines can see it? How will we take and spread the message, becoming heralds of the good news of Gods intended justice for children?v  This morning I want to make a proposal. I made it to our Church Council, the governing body of this church, two weeks ago. Theyll be voting on it in December. See what you think.  As you know, our overarching mission as a United Methodist Church is to make disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world. Here at Edmonds United Methodist Church, we live out that mission as we Worship God. Grow in faith. & Serve the world. Those have been our watchwords for the past seven years: Worship. Grow. Serve. And we have steadily worked at improving our ministries in all of those areas. What I want to suggest this morning is that under the area of Serve the world, we focus our efforts, so that instead of trying to do something about every cause that comes along, or becoming ineffective because were trying to address too many, we concentrate on doing one thing really well. We have to trust that other churches and groups will focus on other important causes. But let this be our piece. I propose that as a congregation, we adopt a mission focus on helping children and families in poverty, in our community and beyond, for the next 3-5 years.  You know, when you are trying to discern what God wants you to do in your life, one way to begin is to ask: what are my strengths? Writer Frederick Buechner defines vocation as the place where your deep gladness meets the worlds deep needs.vi So look at what youre already doing, and what you love to do, and see if you can identify a common thread or theme.  Here at this church, we are already engaged in major ministries that focus on the needs of children and families in poverty. Our food bank serves over 300 families each week. Our Childrens Center offers quality preschool and after-school programs. Our Toy Shop provides Christmas gifts to over 1000 families in need. Our tutoring ministry provides one-on-one tutoring to at-risk students as well as dinner for their families every week.  In one way or another, all of these help children and families in poverty. And if we decided to intensively focus our energies in this one area, we could do more! We could offer more scholarships so that poor children could come to the Childrens Center. We could do the same with Vacation Bible School. We could ask our Advocacy and Public Witness Team to continually alert us to opportunities to advocate for children and families in poverty.  Even seemingly unrelated areas of our church life could be turned to this end: our concerts could become benefits for these ministries, for instance. And we could seek out other churches and groups who are similarly focused, and work together common goals. We are doing that today as we establish a partnership with Washington Kids in Transition. We could become known as a church that cares deeply about children and families in poverty.  And as you know, weve recently sold a piece of church property. We will soon be engaged in deciding how to invest the proceeds so that some of the interest generated can be used for new mission projects. If the Council were to vote in December to approve this proposal, that would guide our decision-making about new and future ministries.  For instance, what if we were to renovate our parsonage and turn it into a center providing much-needed infant and toddler care for struggling families? Or transitional housing for homeless families? Or a home for an immigrant family that we might welcome and adopt? Hopefully, we will soon be soliciting what basically amounts to simplified grant proposals from you for how the land proceeds can best be used to write the vision and make it plain---as in, showing forth, in our community, Gods passionate desire that families be helped out of poverty, and Gods children receive what they need to live and grow.  You see? Im still your pastor. And there are exciting months of ministry ahead. Amen. i These figures come from the website of the Childrens Defense Fund, which sponsors the Childrens Sabbath.

102515tx_i_was_hungry,"I Was Hungry a sermon for Food Bank Sunday at EUMC 10-25-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Isaiah 58:6-9a & Matthew 25:31-36 Jim Wallis, the well-known Christian writer and social activist, tells of an experience that strongly shaped his life.i He was a first-year seminary student when he and a band of eager classmates decided to do a thorough study to find every verse in the Bible that dealt with the poor. They scoured the Old and New Testaments for every single reference to the subject of poverty, and how the people of God are called to respond. To their amazement, they found several thousand biblical verses on this subject! They found that Gods response to poverty is the second most prominent theme in the Hebrew Scriptures--second only to idolatry, with which is it often linked. And in the New Testament, one in every sixteen verses is about wealth and poverty! Then they decided to try what has become a famous experiment. One member of the group took an old Bible and a pair of scissors and began the long process of literally cutting out every single biblical text about the poor. It took him a very long time. As he worked, the books of the prophets were decimated. He found God speaking through the prophet Isaiah, for instance, in our first reading for today: Is not this the fast that I choose: to share your bread with the hungry, and bring the homeless poor into your house; [and] when you see the naked, to cover them? He cut that passage out. He cut out everything the prophets had to say about how nations, rulers, and all of us are instructed to treat people who are poor. Much of the Psalms---in which God is seen as the defender and deliverer of the poor---also disappeared. And when the seminarian got to the New Testament, he had a lot of work to do. He began with the prayer of a peasant woman named Mary, whose Magnificat prophesied the meaning of the coming of Jesus: He haslifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich empty away. Then there was Jesus first sermon in which---hearkening back to Isaiah---he proclaimed his own mission statement: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because God has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. In the Sermon on the Mount, and especially the Beatitudes, Jesus declared that in his kingdom, the blessed ones are the poor, the meek, and the persecuted. Clearly, those passages had to go. Same with the accounts about how, after the Spirit had come upon them, members of the early church began to practice economic sharing. And the apostle Paul saying that there was not a needy one among them. And the stuff from John about how you dont have the love of God in you unless you open your heart to the needy. Snip, snip, snip. When the seminarian was finally done with all his editorial cuts, that Bible was so sliced up, it was literally falling apart in his hands. Which was a dramatic way of uncovering a simple truth. That is: the great bulk of the Bibles teachings about how Gods people are to live in this world have to do with how we respond to people who are poor. Nowhere is this emphasis clearer than in todays gospel reading, from Matthew 25, where Jesus says: 1When the Son of Man comes in glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left. Then the king will say to those at his right hand, Come, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me. Jesus says, As you did it to one of the least of these, my sisters and brothers, you did it to me. Jesus seems to be promising---to those of us born centuries too late to meet the historical Jesus in person---that the closest we can come to a transformative face-to-face encounter with Christ is to aid and be fully present to poor. Conversely, Jesus says, If you failed to do it to the least of these, you failed to do it to me. That is, if you walk past someone who is hungry or thirsty or poor or sick or ill-clothed without helping them, youve walked past me. Which is sobering, isnt it? Mother Teresa once said about this Scripture: Jesus comes to us in the distressing disguise of the poor.ii Whats so striking about this passage is that most of the people gathered before the throne of Christ in this story really believe that they are his followers! Theyre stunned to learn that they will be separated and judged by how they have responded to the poor! It comes as a shock to hear this message from Jesus, that Gods ultimate measure of our lives will not be about how often we pray or go to church, or about our sexual ethics, or about church leadership and success in ministry, or even about the right religious beliefs---its not about beliefs at all! According to Jesus, its not our religiosity, but our human kindness, that determines our eternal destiny. You and I might contemplate that sliced-up Bible that Jim Wallis holds up---a Bible minus its teachings about wealth and poverty, reduced to paper lace---and start to shut down inside. Its justoverwhelming. We might long to go home and put a pillow over our heads, to drown out the crying of all the impoverished people in the world. We might listen to this teaching of Jesus about the sheep and the goats, and think sadly, helplessly, even angrily: well, I guess Im a goat, then. Because Im not Mother Teresa! Im not ready to make helping the poor the focus of my life. Besides, there is so much need in this world, its staggering. What could I possibly do to change anything? Im helped, at this point, when I go back and read our gospel text again: I was hungry and you fed me, I was naked and you clothed me Notice that the pronoun Jesus uses is singular, I. Its not plural. Its not on a grand scale, but a personal one. Jesus doesnt say, All the millions of poor people in the world are your responsibility, and you must help them. He says simply, Im the person right in front of you, the one in need, the one you can help, or from whom you can turn away. 2I like the story that former President Jimmy Carter tells in his book, Sources of Strength. Its about a Cuban pastor named Eloy Cruz who had a wonderful rapport with Puerto Rican immigrants, very poor people. He seemed to be able to influence the direction of their lives in positive ways. So President Carter asked about the secret to his success. Pastor Cruz was embarrassed to be signaled out, but he finally said this, We only need to have two loves in our lives: for God, and for the person who happens to be in front of us at any time.iii A woman named Heidi Baker, who helps to care for 3,000 orphans around the world, says the same thing. When asked for advice about how to deal with a world of massive pain and need, she answers with the words that are printed at the top of your worship guide this morning: Its not complicated. Just love the one in front of you. She calls it loving the One, with a capital O. Thats what Jesus did, she says. Whomever the one in front of him was, he was devoted to their well-being. He helped them. He loved them. Think about that for a moment. Imagine yourself leaving the house tomorrow. Who will be standing in front of you? Is it the child at the bus stop, who hasnt had breakfast? Or the tattooed barista at Starbucks, who could really use a generous tip? Is it the single mother who drops her child at the same school that your child attends, the one who is on her way to work and already looks exhausted at 8:00 in the morning? What about the neighbor who is older, and confused about the month or day? Even if you cant save the world, you can affect one person. You can love one. You can help one. A card for the cashier at the grocery store, a meal for the homeless, an offer to babysit, an evening of tutoring for one student, once a week. Thats not so hard. In doing that, one will change one, which will change one, and maybe you really will change the world. So often we think we cant make much difference, so we dont do anything at all. Many of us have never done so much as sold an old lawn mower and used the money to help the poor! Mother Teresa used to say, We cannot all do great things. But we can do small things with great love.iv Start with the person in front of you, the one in need. Extend kindness to them, in whatever way you can. And see where that takes you. We have an example of that right here in this church. Peggy Kennedy, one of our beloved long-time members, is as close to Mother Teresa as I will probably ever get. You may know the story of how she and Gretchen Dixon, 34 years ago, responded to a request to provide food for our hungry neighbors here in Edmonds. They started with bags of canned goods in a closet downstairs---it was actually an unfinished restroom, which is about as humble as you can get. They were soon feeding 20 people a week, and thought it might last for as long as six weeks. But the need kept growing. And Peggy and Gretchen, gradually joined by other volunteers, kept offering foodalong with warmth, humor, and human kindness----to everyone who came seeking help. One, one, one. After a few years they moved into a larger room downstairs, which is now used for sorting food. They acquired refrigerators and freezers. They purchased trucks for transporting donations from local grocery stores. They moved into the even larger area in Fellowship Hall. Peggy came onto our church staff as Food Bank Director. She partnered with other organizations, and welcomed volunteers from other churches and the wider community. 3Have you ever gone down to the Food Bank here at church, on a Tuesday morning? It is an incredible operation! It now serves an average of 1500 people every week! You go downstairs and you see piles of produce, bread and meat. And people from all walks of life, some with children in tow, people with shopping carts so that they have the dignity of choosing what their families will eat, people laughing, talking and working side by side, men and women, young and old, volunteers and friends---you feel the presence of Christ down there, in their midst. You feel renewed hope for the world. Its not that responding to poverty doesnt include trying to influence public policies on a larger scale---not long ago our congregation mobilized to write over a thousand letters to our legislators. Its that you start where you are. You do what you can for the person who is in front of you, the one who is hungry or poor. After a time, you will start asking why they are poor. And you go from there. Each person in need, an opportunity to encounter Jesus Christ! Challenging, yes, and sobering. But also a promise of the Presence of holiness. As you do it to the least of these, my brothers and sisters, you do it to me. Amen. iJimWallishastoldthisstorymanytimesinthecourseof preachingandpublicspeaking.it canalsobefoundinhisbook,GodsPolitics:WhytheRightGetsItWrongandtheLeftDoesntGetIt(NewYork:HarperCollinsPublisher,2005)pp.212-..214iiThis is awell-..knownquotation,widely availableinbooksandon-..line.iiiJimmyCarter,SourcesofStrength:MeditationsonScripture foraLivingFaith(NewYork:ThreeRiversPress,1997)ThisisthelaststoryinhisIntroductiontothebook.ivAgain,thisquotation byMotherTeresaiswidelyavailable,in manybooksand on-..line.4"
11115tx_saints_preserve_us,"Saints Preserve Us! preached at EUMC on All Saints Day 11/1/15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Hebrews 11:29-12:2 & II Cor. 13:11-12  This week, as my mind turned toward today, All Saints Day, I remembered a person who I hadnt thought about in a long time.  His name was Muddhata. He lived in a tiny house just on the other side of the fence in my backyard. My family lived on the edge of the American naval base in Yokohama, Japan. Just beyond our backyard fence was the world of Japanese civilians, a world into which I, as a kindergartner, was forbidden to go by myself. But I did go. When my mother wasnt looking, I crept through the gate between our house and Muddhatas, and went to visit this old Japanese man who was my friend.  I was five years old. Muddhata was 88---I know because even though he spoke no English and I spoke very little Japanese, he showed me his age by holding up his fingers and letting me count, all the way up to 88. Muddhata and his wife lived in a wooden house with paper walls and sliding doors. They fed me crackers flecked with green seaweed. When I showed Muddhata that I had lost a tooth, he laughed and opened his mouth, revealing that he had only one yellow tooth in his whole head.  Somewhere along the line, my parents learned about my friendship with Muddhata. On my sixth birthday, they let me take pieces of pink birthday cake over to him and his wife. In return, Muddhata said, he had a present for me. But in order to receive it, I had to come to his house very early the following morning, just as the sun was beginning to rise.  You can imagine my excitement the next day, when I got up, put on my jacket and sneakers, and crept in the half-light of dawn through the fence to Muddhatas house. He was there, waiting for me. But instead of taking me into the house as usual, Muddhata took my hand and began to lead me down the winding flight of wooden steps, built into the earth, that led past his house and down to the village below, where I was forbidden to go. Down and down we went, past clumps of bamboo, past the old bicycle that Muddhata and his wife used for transportation, past tall rushes and a bubbling pond.  But then Muddhata stopped suddenly, placed his hands on my shoulders, and turned me slowly around. There before us, suspended between the rushes, was his gift. It was a huge, intricately woven spider web, as large as myself, and hung with dewdrops flashing fire in the morning light.  I will never forget that childhood experience. It comes singing and soaring to me, down through the years: the memory of an old man and a little girl, standing together in silence, mesmerized by the beauty of a spider web. Muddhatas gift, the gift of helping me to see ordinary life in all its splendor, is one of the most precious I have ever received.  Muddhata is long dead by now. My family moved back to the States when I was in second grade, and I never saw him or heard from him again. All these years later, I wonder if he ever had any idea of the gift he gave to my life. But whether he knew it or not, Muddhata was a saint.  The word saint is one that needs some reviving in our time. Five hundred years ago, when Western Christianity split into the Roman Catholic Church and Protestantism, many of our Protestant forbears decided that one of the things they didnt believe in was saints. Thats what Roman Catholics believed in. My Southern Methodist grandparents would have been shocked by what we are doing here today, celebrating All Saints Sunday. Thats what Catholics do, they would have said. Protestants dont do saints!  But the ecumenical movement of the last seventy years changed that. It was as if members of the same family, whose ancestors split apart four hundred years ago, began to get together. They discovered that each branch had kept some family treasures in custody all those years, treasures that were lost to the other branch, but belonged to the heritage of both. All Saints is one of those treasures.  So, for instance, we are learning that in the early church of Britain, which I explored on my renewal leave two years ago, it was believed that the veil that separates the living and the dead is thin---so thin that we can talk to departed loved ones, in the most matter-of-fact way. We can seek their guidance, and receive their help and support. And this, Celtic Christians said, was especially true at the autumn Festival of All Saints, which they understood to be a thin place in time.  In recent years, then, Protestants have been rediscovering All Saints, and restoring it to its rightful place as one of the four high holy days of the Christian year, along with Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost. All Saints belongs to all Christians.  Something else has been discovered, too, in the reclaiming of All Saints Day. That is that the word saint originally did not refer to a group of people whove been canonized by the pope. When Paul writes, in todays reading from I Corinthians, All the saints greet you, he is referring to the members of his churches! The word saint, as it is used in the Bible, simply means someone through whom the love of God is revealed. All of us are called to be saints.  Muddhata was a saint in my life, because the love of God---for this beautiful world, and for a little girl like me---was communicated through him. I could list other saints in my childhood for you. Aunt Alice, the kind neighbor lady who treated me to bedtime stories and Beemans gum. Mr. Boothby, the 5th grade teacher, who believed in me and expected the most from me. Marie Long, the babysitter who sent M & Ms for my Christmas stocking every year, even after I was grown  I could go on and onif you let me!---with my own catalogue of saints. Which is what the author of the letter to the Hebrews is doing, in our second reading for today. In a famous passage known as the roll call of the saints, he lists individuals from biblical history who have communicated the Spirit of God through the quality of their lives: Abraham and Sarah, who trusted in Gods promises. Moses, who led his people out of slavery; and Rahab, who helped them enter the Promised Land. He continues: And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jepthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets. This goes on for some time, working up to the saints of his own time, men and women who were martyrs of the early church. A roll call of the saints has a particular function: to remind us of the people who have gone before us, whose lives have contributed to our own. For all of us have been shaped and formed by the influences of others. If you yourself have any strength of character, any sense of your own worth, any values to live by or dreams to live for, you probably owe that to certain individuals who you can name today. Who is on your personal roll call of the saints? Today is the day to remember and thank God for them. They have given you the foundation on which you have built your life.  Two weeks ago, I had the joy of welcoming a new grandson into the world. At one point, I sat holding him, rocking to help him go to sleep. I sat there in the dimmed room, rocking and crooning a lullaby, and suddenly I had a mental picture of all the mothers before me---my mother and her mother and a host of nameless other mothers and grandmothers, going all the way back in time, who must have done exactly the same thing, singing and rocking their babies to sleep.  I thought of all the generations of parents who have prayed over their children, laughed and cried over them, made sacrifices to give them a better life. I thought of my father, who died of a heart attack at age 54, without ever getting to retire and enjoy the fruits of his labors. And I wished I could lift up my grandson, finally asleep in my arms, and say, Daddy, look! Look at who has come after you, and inherited the legacy of your love for us, and all your hard work. And I wondered, there in the dusky light, if my father saw.  The roll call of the saints has another function, too. Not only does it remind us of the people who have gone before us, whose lives have blessed our own. It also helps us to take our place in the grand scheme of things, knowing that what we do, and the way we live, will contribute to the lives of those who come after us.  The writer of Hebrews expresses this with a vivid image. He says: we are like runners in a race, and all of these saints are like runners whove gone before us, and who are now in the grandstands, cheering us on. Imagine all the saints who have been part of this congregation over the years, encouraging us today. Our race is run, they say, and now its your turn. Now its your turn to open a childs eyes to the beauty of a spider web. Your turn to extend the kindness, make the pie, write the book, work the garden, rock the baby----or whatever is given to you, in your particular vocation as a saint, to do.  Therefore, says the writer of our text in Hebrews, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is before us. For thats how we thank them, the saints we have known. We honor them by keeping alive and sharing with others the love, the strength, the faith, and the hope they have shared with us.  In just a few moments, we will be taking communion together, and lighting candles for those whose lives we are remembering and celebrating today. I will be lighting a candle for Muddhata. I will be thinking of my mother and father. Who will you be thinking of?  Let us celebrate our communion with God, with one another, and with all the saints. Amen. "
111515tx_redeemingdarkness,"Redeeming Darkness a sermon preached at EUMC 11-15-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Exodus 20:18-21 & Ps. 139:1-12  On Monday of this past week, my friend Anne came for a visit. Weve known each other since college days. We call each other our same time next year friend because, although weve lived in different parts of the country for almost forty years now, weve been getting together at least once a year to catch up on each others lives.  This year Anne had lots of stories to tell, because she and her husband had just returned to the States after living for three years in Kenya. There, as the caretakers of a huge wildlife reserve, they had lived in the center of vast open spaces. I was eager to hear all about it, and at one point I asked, Now that youre back, what do you miss about your time in Africa?  Without hesitation, Anne answered: I miss the darkness. She explained, I miss the dark nights---home now, in the city, we can hardly see any stars! You might even forget they are there! And I miss the silenceWell, not exactly silence, she amended. On the reserve at night, it was so quiet that you could hear the insects, and small animals in the grass, and large animals on the move.  It was strange, hearing Anne say, I miss the darkness. Because as she spoke, I was in the process of reading a book in preparation for todays sermon, and to which I am greatly indebted this morning. The book, by Barbara Brown Taylor, is called Learning to Walk in the Dark. i  Taylor, who is an Episcopal priest, acknowledges that darkness is often associated with the things that scare us. In our Bible, for instance, there are about a hundred references to darkness, most of them suggesting danger and death. When God is angry with people, they are plunged into darkness. Plagues of locusts darken the land. Darkness becomes biblical shorthand for that which is sinister, sinful, or tragic. Jesus comes as light into the world, the gospel writer says, but the world loved darkness rather than the light. On the day Jesus dies, from noon until three, darkness covers the earth.  Visit almost any church today, including this one, and you can still hear this kind of religious language: Deliver us, O God, from the powers of darkness. Shine into our hearts the brightness of your Spirit, and protect us from the perils of the night.ii So we learn that darkness is evil, scary, and just plain bad. Light, on the other hand, is synonymous with goodness, holiness, and life.  There are some problems, however, with representing and understanding the world in this way. For one thing, what does it say to---and about---people with dark skins? Or those who are blind? For another, is it really helpful to divide up the world, and all human experience, into light and dark, holy and unholy, as if God were not everywhere?  And f we associate God only with the sunny aspects of human experience, what happens when darkness falls on your life: when you lose your job, say, or your marriage falls apart, or you become depressed, or you lie in bed at night despairing over the ice caps melting or the latest terrorist attack, or you pray hard for something that doesnt happen, or you begin to doubt that God exists at all? Is the darkness your own fault, because you dont have enough faith? And if God is identified only with the light, does that mean we are left to deal with great portions of human experiencethings like loneliness, loss, uncertainty, suffering and death---on our own?  We go back to the Bible and look again, more deeply. And we make a discovery. We notice that in the Bible, lots of important things happen in the dark. In Genesis, God creates in the darkness. God takes the patriarch Abraham outside at night to look at the stars, and there in the darkness Abraham decides to trust God. Abrahams grandson, Jacob, wrestles with an angel through the night, and is blessed. Jacobs son, Joseph, dreams at night and receives Gods messages. Once you start looking for it, all through the Bible you find God showing up and doing things in the dark!  The Exodus from Egypt happens at night. Manna falls from heaven during the night. Jesus is born in the darkness of a cave---what we picture as a wooden stable in Bethlehem was actually a cave---and the resurrection, too, takes place in a caves thick darkness. Through the prophet Isaiah, God says, I will give you the treasures of darkness and riches hidden in secret places, so that you may know that it is I, the Lord, the God of Israel, who calls you by your name.iii  Turn to our first reading for this morning, from the Book of Exodus. Having escaped from slavery in Egypt, the Hebrews have entered the wilderness of Sinai. Theyre encamped at the base of a mountain. Three times they send their leader, Moses, up the mountain, to receive a word from God. On his third ascent there is thunder and lightning, the blast of a trumpet, and a dense cloud of smoke on the mountain. In fear and trembling, Moses ascends all the way to the summit, where, as our text puts it, he drew near to the thick darkness where God was.iv He encounters God---the mysterium tremendum, the Holy Mystery---in the midst of deep, dazzling darkness.  Have you ever noticed this before? In the Bible, God is present in both light and darkness. In our second reading for today, the Psalmist proclaims, the night is as bright as the day, for darkness is as light to you.v God acts in the darkness as well as in the light. God shows up in the midst of darkness, and meets us there.  One of the early church fathers, a monk named Gregory of Nyssa, read this text in Exodus as a description of the spiritual life. He wrote, Moses vision began with light. Afterward God spoke to him in a cloud. But when Moses rose higher and became more perfect, he saw God in the darkness.vi This is how the spiritual journey goes, he said. It takes you on a path that winds through shadows as well as patches of light, and God is in them both. In fact, you should not be surprised when you go through times when God seems hidden: this is a sign that like Moses, you are drawing closer to the splendor of God, which shines forth in darkness.  A Christian mystic, writing in the 14th Century, says the same thing. Perhaps in college you too read the book called The Cloud of Unknowing. I still have a battered copy in my study. The anonymous author writes, This darkness and cloud is always between you and God, no matter what you doand it prevents you from seeing [God] clearly by the light of your own understanding in your reason... So set yourself to rest in this darkness for as long as you can, always crying out after [the One] who you love. For if you are to experience or see [God] at all, insofar as it is possible here, it must always be in this cloud and in this darkness.vii  There is great wisdom here. I think of our emotional lives: isnt it true that when we experience what might be called the dark emotions---things like fear, grief, and despair---the way to healing and transformation isnt by trying to avoid, deny or distract ourselves from the darkness, but by willingness to enter it with courage and trust and curiosity? It may not be what we want to hear, but when it comes to the dark forest of these emotions, the only way out is through.viii  I think of our intellectual lives: isnt it true that the more we learn, the more we realize we dont know? And the more we know, the more aware we are of the enormity of what remains unknown? This is why ignorance is cocky and wisdom is humble. Sometimes I think that if I live long enough and become wise enough, I will realize that I dont know anything at all.  And I think of my own spiritual life thus far. Yes, there have been times when God has seemed gloriously present and real! Like bright sunlight on a summer day, obvious and undeniable. But there have also been times in my journey when Ive stumbled along in the dark, having to let go of my concepts and certainties about God, learning to trust the God who refuses to be defined or contained. And Ive learned that although I cannot grasp and hold God, God holds me.  There have been times in my life that Ive experienced an absence of God so dense that it feels like presence. And Ive cried out in the darkness for the Holy One, who, as it turns out, will not appear on demand, but who shows up in the most unexpected ways.  Is this true in your spiritual journey, too? I have to say, at this point, as I am growing older, and friends are beginning to die, and the end of my own life is appearing on the horizon, I appreciate anew what the Psalmist means by the valley of the shadow of death. But I am learning to walk in the dark. Im learning that it is possible to trust God in all things. And Im learning that there are some things you can see in the darkness---like the brilliance of stars in a night sky---that you cant see in the light of day. As the poet Wendell Berry writes, the darkness, too, blooms and sings.ix  Barbara Brown Taylor comes to the same conclusion. She write this: When, despite all my best efforts, the lights have gone off in my life,plunging me into the kind of darkness that turns my knees to water, nonetheless I have not died. [Instead] I have learned things in the dark that I could never have learned in the light, things that have saved my life over and over again, so that there is really only one logical conclusion. I need darkness as much as I need light.x  We are now heading into the darkest time of the year. Soon well enter the season of Advent, which is traditionally marked by somber joy and quiet expectation.  Shall we approach this time, together, with courage and curiosity? Shall we dare to speak into the gathering darkness, speak of our fears and hopes and longings? Shall we listen attentively, like my friend Anne, who learned in Africa to love the living, breathing darkness?  Shall we trust that God will meet us there? Amen. i Barbara Brown Taylor, Learning to Walk in the Dark (New York; HarperCollins Publisher, 2014) I love this book and thoroughly commend it to you! ii Taylor quotes this prayer, p. 6. It may be from the Episcopal prayer book. iii Isaiah 45:3 iv Exodus 20:21b v Psalm 139:12 vi I learned about this in seminary, and Taylor quotes it on p. 48.

112215tx_blessedtogive,"Blessed to Give Commitment Sunday at EUMC 11-22-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James texts: Proverbs 11:24-25 & II Cor. 9:6-15  Last Sunday, you may remember, I preached a sermon called Redeeming Darkness. Two days later, we had the windstorm and power outage, plunging many of our neighborhoods into darkness! And I enjoyed the text messages that some of you sent, saying things like: Kathlyn, there is something peaceful about this darkness. And this: I was planning to work tonight, but instead Im playing cards with my family by candlelight. Were redeeming the darkness!  Last week, too, we lifted up the biblical scene in which God takes Abraham outside to look up and marvel at the night sky. God promises Abraham that he and his wife Sarah will be blessed with descendants as numerous as the stars. Not only will they be blessed, God says, but they will be a blessing to others. Their family will become a great nation, and all the families of the earth will be blessed through them.  Which brings us to our theme for today. That is: that God desires abundance for all people, and this is how its accomplished. Abraham and Sarah will receive great blessings, and blessing will flow through them to others, for the benefit of all.  Notice this theme in all of our scripture readings for today. Theres the saying of Jesus, printed at the top of your worship guide: Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over.i And our reading from the Book of Proverbs: Whoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered. And from the apostle Paul in his Second Letter to Corinthians: The one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.  In all three of these scripture lessons, the picture is one of mutuality and reciprocity, blessings flowing back and forth. I love how the evangelist Billy Graham describes this biblical principle. He says: God has given us two hands--one to receive with and the other to give with. We are not cisterns made for hoarding; we are channels made for sharing.ii  We might picture it this way. Imagine that each of our lives is a cup, or a chalice. Blessings from God pour into it, as God poured blessings into the lives of Abraham and Sarah, for the blessing of the world. Thats how its supposed to work: the cup is perpetually being filled, and perpetually flowing over into the lives of others. As the Psalmist says, My cup overflows.iii  But if the cup is never poured out---if Gods blessings are received and hoarded rather than shared---there reaches a point where nothing more can go in. The life-giving flow is stilled. In the same way, if the cup is poured out and poured out but never filled, there comes a time when its store is depleted. And again, the circulation stops. In order for Gods blessings to be multiplied for the good of all, there must be a continuous process of both inflow and outflow.  Or picture it this way, with the symbol of infinity. [It appears on screen.] In the divine economy, the continuous circulation of blessings leads to abundance for all. What God intends for us is a never-ending process of giving and receiving, giving and receiving. This principle of circulation may seem like a no-brainer. And yet, like many of the Bibles teachings, its counter-cultural in our time. If you watch television commercials, for instance, or read popular magazines or pop-up ads, you get the strong message that abundance of life isnt found by giving and receiving, but by getting and keeping as much as you can.  I know a man who was captivated by this illusion. Growing up, he was taught to strive mightily for awards and applause. And he internalized the belief that this is what life requires, this is what abundance means. He learned to see other people---friends, lovers, associates, customers---as means to an end, commodities to be acquired and attached to his life. As the saying goes: he used people and loved things, rather than the other way around. And in worldly terms, you might look at him today and say that hes been successful.  But when you look more closely, you notice that this man, now in his late fifties, lives alone in a big, empty house. He has been married and divorced five times. His ex-wives say, All that man can do is take; he doesnt know how to give. His children, scattered around the country, have little to do with him. They angrily tell their therapists that their father never loved them. He cared only about how they made him look, rather than loving them for who they were.  When Thanksgiving comes this week, this man will go to a restaurant for dinner. He will come home, pour himself a scotch, and stare in genuine bewilderment at a phone that doesnt ring. Where did he go wrong? He did what he was taught to do. He worked hard; he went after what he wanted, believing that this was the key to abundant life. Now his life is like a cup thats filled to the brim but never poured out, never shared. His house, filled with showcase furniture, is still.  Im sure you know other versions of this same story, of the person who takes in and in and in, but only knows how to hoard and hold, rather than let go and give. What you see when you look at such a person is the tragic consequence of not knowing---or disregarding---the spiritual law that abundance of life requires not only receiving, but also giving.  However, as I look around this room this morning, my guess is that more of us who are here probably err in the other direction. I am talking about those among us who, as a result of our conditioning, hold the belief that abundance of life is not about receiving at all, but about givingand giving  and giving of ourselves, even to the point of giving ourselves away.  I think of a woman I know. She was taught, early on, that her role in life was to be endlessly nurturing of others. In high school she listened to everyone elses problems. Her mother liked to say that she was always taking in strays: stray animals, and stray people. She was married at a young age, to a man who had problems that she hoped her unstinting love would fix.  This woman became a nurse (are you surprised?). She works long, hard hours at a hospital, doing her best to care for each patient assigned to her. But there are too many patients, and she keeps a killing pace. She habitually skips breaks and works overtime, neglecting her own needs for things like rest and renewal. And others have come to count on her to do so, again and again and again.  This womans husband left her because, as he said, she couldnt meet his needs. They had both shared the belief that she should have, and, that if shed just tried harder, she could have. Her friends tell her to stop being a doormat. Her grown children, however, call her a saint. She never thinks of herself, they say; she is always thinking of other people, putting them first.  This week, when Thanksgiving comes, this woman will cook a meal for twelve members of her family, plus a few strays. Later, she will stand at a kitchen sink overflowing with dishes. Up to her elbows in soapy water, she will catch her own reflection in the steamed-up kitchen window. She looks tired; her inner resources are depleted. She wishes she could juststop. But what would all the people who are depending on her do then?  We all know someone like this woman. Some of us are her, to some degree. And the odd thing is, this woman, who gives and gives to others, like a cup that is continually being poured out but not adequately replenished, has much in common with the man who only takes and takes. Both of them, in their own ways, lead diminished lives. Both feel confused and alone. For both have impeded the essential flow of life, by refusing--or not knowing how--to give and receive.  What about your life? Is it out of balance, in one direction or another? Is there too much receiving, and not enough giving of yourself to others? Or too much giving, and not enough receiving? What would it look like if you found a healthier rhythm between the two?  We might ask the same of any relationship we are in---at work, at home, and in our social lives. Is one party in the relationship doing too much givingof time, say, or attention, or affection---and the other too much taking? Or is there a good ebb and flow? Are both parties being blessed by the relationship? Or do some adjustments need to be made?  The same question can be applied to groups and whole communities. In your family, for instance, is there an expectation that every member has something to contribute, as well as much to receive? And in a larger group, like this congregation, say, is there a healthy circulation of the gifts of time, energy, money, work, and prayer, for the blessing of all? Or, as is the case in many groups, are 20% of the people doing 80% of the giving?  Do you remember the description of the thriving early church described in the Book of Acts? Were told that all its members gave what they could, and received what they needed, so that there was not a needy person among them.iv And day by day, as they spent much time together in the temple, they broke bread and ate their food with glad and generous hearts.v  Now, Im not implying, this morning, that we should give to others in order to receive back. Thats just another way of plotting how to gain more and more for ourselves. The biblical principle of circulation has to do with freely and joyfully participating in a blessing economy, in which God plots goodness for all. It means giving and receiving with glad and generous hearts. It mean asking not, What can I spare? but What can I share?  I recently came across something called a commitment to the law of giving and receiving.vi Let me commend it to you, this morning, as a spiritual practice that might be especially good during the approaching holidays. The commitment has three parts, which are to say: i Luke 6:38 ii I dont know the original reference for this quotation by Billy Graham, but it is widely available in books and on-line. iii From the 23rd Psalm iv Acts 4:34a v Acts 2:46-47b vi This is also widely available, in various forms (and from a surprising range of sources!) I found it through the Chopra Center on-line at http://www.chopra.com/the-law-of-giving-receiving. I have adapted it for this sermon. 1. Wherever I go, and whomever I encounter today, I will bring them a gift. The gift might be a compliment, a flower, some material resource, a word of encouragement, a smile, or a prayer. And each time I meet someone, I will silently wish them peace, fulfillment, and joy. 2. Today I will gratefully receive all the gifts that life has to offer to me. I will give thanks for the gifts of nature: the sound of birdsong, or the first snow of winter. I will likewise seek to recognize and receive the blessings that come to me from and through other people. And: 3. Today I will make a commitment to participate in the process of circulating Gods blessings, in my life and in the lives of others, especially by giving and receiving lifes most precious gifts: the gifts of attention, caring, help, appreciation and love.  Which reminds me of something else that happened, this past week. On Wednesday night, the power in my neighborhood was still out. I was anticipating a dinner of crackers and cheese and another early bedtime in a chilly house. Instead, the phone rang: a neighbor inviting me to come to her motor home, parked in the driveway and equipped with its own generator. She said, Come on over! We have heat and lights!  What happened next was like a parable for todays theme. Neighbors came out of their darkened houses: kids in pajamas, adults in bathrobes, bearing gifts of food, cookies, wine, and cider to be warmed on the stove. Soon there was an impromptu party going on! Neighbors happily squished together in that motor home, with golden light spilling from its windows into the street. People eating and drinking, laughing and talking, giving and receiving, with glad and generous hearts.  In a few minutes we will have the opportunity to bring our pledges and offerings to the altar, dedicating them to Gods good purposes for all. After the [second] service we will gather downstairs to celebrate the abundance in this place through a dessert potluck, kids running around, holiday crafts, a short story for Thanksgiving, and conversation with friends, old and new. Today is a feast of good things! Its also an act of faith and commitment as, like Abraham and Sarah, we participate in Gods way of blessing the world.  Amen.      "
112915tx_mangerjohn,"Faces at the Manger: John the Baptist a sermon for Advent I 11-29-15 by the Rev. Dr. Kathlyn James at EUMC text: Matthew 11:2-11, 14:1-13a  Today is the first Sunday in Advent, the season in which we prepare our hearts for the coming of Christ. And at the beginning of Advent, in all three years of the lectionary cycle---that is, the prescribed scripture readings for Sunday morning---we always encounter John the Baptist.  You remember that John the Baptist is a wild character in the gospel stories. He ate locusts for breakfast and lived out in the desert, where he called people to prepare for the coming Messiah by repenting of their sins. In our texts for today, John has dared to speak that way even to the king. John has said to King Herod: Your behavior is a disgrace to our nation and an affront to God! Herod has responded, as you might expect, by saying, Youre under arrest. So now John the Baptist has been thrown into prison in the dungeon of Herods palace, near the shore of the Dead Sea.  The Herods had been the ruling dynasty of Israel for several generations. We hear about two King Herods in the gospel story. First there is Herod the Great, who was on the throne when Jesus was born. Herod the Great was something like the Godfather of the Herodian dynasty. He was famous for his cowardice, ambition, and greed. (Actually, looking at Herods family tree, I think somebody could make money by basing a television series on it. It would be every bit as sensational as ABCs hit series, Scandal. The Herodians---dont you think that has a nice ring to it?)  Anyway, Herod the Great married ten times, an abomination to the monogamous Jews. With all those wives and children in the palace, a lot of intrigue went on, especially since Herod was terrified that a member of his family would someday kill him and seize his throne. So he beat them to it: he poisoned several wives and murdered three of his own sons. It was this paranoia that prompted the terrible slaughter of the innocents we read about in scripture. When Herod heard that the successor to his throne had been born in Bethlehem, he ordered that all male infants in that city be killed.  Thats Herod the Great. And the second Herod we hear about in scripture, known as Herod Antipas, was one of his sons (one who survived). Herod Antipas ascended the throne after his father died, amazingly, of natural causes. This is the Herod in todays text, the king who threw John the Baptist into prison for criticizing him publicly. This is also the Herod who would one day preside over the crucifixion of Jesus.  Herod Antipas continued his family traditions of scandal, including incest and murder. The particular incident that provoked John the Baptist to condemn him was his recent marriage to his niece, Herodias, who was also married to Herods brother at the time. Herod had eliminated that obstacle, however, by killing his brother. John spoke out against all this. He preached that even kings are not exempt from Gods moral laws. So now hes in prison, in the basement of Herods palace.  The story goes on, and I think I know how the producers of a TV series called The Herodians would film it. Theyd show the revelry, one night, in the dining hall of the palace. There would be Herod, surrounded by smiling flatterers, carefully groomed women, and slaves with expressionless faces. Hed be lying on a couch and gorging on food and wine. Then music with a sensuous, pulsating rhythm would begin, and Herod would watch, with a lecherous smile, while his stepdaughter, Salome, danced for the whole company.  At the end of her performance, Salome bows before the king. Expansive with wine, Herod looks her over, slowly, and makes a grand gesture. He offers to give Salome anything she wants, anything at all. Salome glances at her mother, Herodias, who sits in jewels on a cushion near Herod, her new husband. Then Salome looks back at Herod, and says, Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter.  There is a shocked silence. Herod himself regrets his rashness; this is sure to cause a furor among the Jews. But hes the king, and hes given his word. So he issues the order, and within an hour, there it is: a decapitated head with Johns glittering, dead eyes, looking up from a serving dish. Salome takes the platter and presents it to her mother, revealing who it was who had instructed her to make this request. Herodias looks coolly down at the head of the foolish prophet who had dared to condemn her marriage to the king. Then she smiles, snaps her fingers, and the party goes on.  Thats how a TV producer might tell the story. And thats how it was circulated at the time, reported in much the same way that our news media today focuses on stories about violence, crime, and corruption in high places. Its the way Josephus, the Roman historian from whom we get most of our information about the times of Christ, reports the story. A prophet challenges the tyrant king; his head rolls; and the party goes on. The end.  But there is another kind of writer who tells this story, one who is also a dramatist, a news analyst and a historian, but who sees and interprets events through a different lens. These are the gospel writers. And this morning I want us to look at how Matthew, one of the gospel writers, tells the story a little differently than the other interpreters of his day.  Like the others, Matthew tells about whats happening on the dance floor in Herods palace. He tells the whole gruesome story, ending with Johns head on a plate. But before that, Matthew drops his lens from the dance floor of the palace and invites us to look beneath it, down in the dungeon where John the Baptist, with chains around his ankles, paces in the dark.  John knows that his own death is imminent. Nobody openly defies Herod and lives. But his own personal fate is not what John is agonizing over now. He has believed himself called to be a prophet, the forerunner of the Messiah, and he wants to know: Did I accomplish what I was supposed to do with my life? Is my work finished? The uncertainty is tormenting him. He anxiously sends his disciples to Jesus with the question, Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?  I want you to notice the poignancy of this passage. Remember John in his earlier days, when he baptized Jesus in the River Jordan? In those days, John had stood knee-deep in the river and roared like a lion to all who came out to hear him preach. And crowds of people had responded, asking to be baptized. Johns faith had been strong in those days. When Jesus came to the Jordan, John had recognized him immediately, saying, This is the Son of God.  But now, in the darkness of a prison cell, faith comes harder to John. In his glory days, when things were going well, he had known that Jesus was the Messiah. Now, with the executioner sharpening his sword down the hall, he is not so sure. What once was easy to believe is now terribly hard. Its a poignant scene in the Bible: John the Baptist in prison, struggling to believe. He sends a messenger to Jesus with the agonized question: Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?  Johns disciples soon return, bearing a reply from Jesus. They whisper through the barred window: Tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and then poor have good news preached to them John recognizes these words from Hebrew scripture, where the prophet Isaiah says: Strengthen the weak hands and make firm the feeble knees. Say to those who are of a fearful heart, Be strong, and do not fear! Here is your GodThen the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped; then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless shall sing for joy.  John strains to listen, searches the faces beyond the window, hears of Isaiahs prophecies being fulfilled. Weve seen him, John, his disciples tell him. Hes come. John leans back against the stone wall of his cell, and closes his eyes.  The disciples relate what Jesus said next, how he eulogized the man who is about to be executed: Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist. At this, tears slide from beneath Johns lids, and down his matted beard. He has accomplished what he was called to do. His lifes work is finished, and approved by God. He can die in peace.  Why do we look at this story on the first Sunday of Advent, four weeks before Christmas? Why are we to ponder the grisly death of John the Baptist, right before we celebrate the birth of Christ? Because Advent is a season of hope, and John the Baptist, bound in chains but sending a messenger with the question, Are you the one, or are we to look for another? is our model of hope. And because this story in Matthew, focused on whats happening in the basement while Herod and his friends revel in the palace, is a story about our grounds for hope in this world.  Matthew tells the story differently than a TV producer or a newscaster might tell it, and differently than a historian who chronicles history in terms of wars and the machinations of political powers. Matthew tells whats going on behind the scenes, telling us that even though we live in a world where Herod always seems to be on the throne and John the Baptist always seems to be in chains, there is another kind of power at work in the world and in our lives. Unnoticed, unseen, quietly working in the basements beneath the thrones, the power of God will outlast all empires and outlive all tyrants.  Do you believe that? Thats the question our text puts to us this morning. Its the age-old question of how we can have hope in a world in which there is so much evil. John the Baptist is a prisoner on death row. Herod gets to keep his head, and everything else too: his crown, his wives, his wealth. Herod has the greater power here.or does he?  The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead once observed, The most important thing you can say about evil is that is has no power to endure. Evil destroys and kills, so what is left by the work of evil is something that has no life. Evil cant be sustained except by violence, and violence ultimately destroys itself. Every evil empire that has ever existed in human history has collapsed. There never has been one that has endured.  Goodness, on the other hand, has power to endure. From a gospel writers point of view, goodness should not be thought of as some titanic force that will match the forces of evil violence for violence, and ultimately win out. No. Goodness doesnt work that way. It doesnt try to crush its opponents; it simply goes about the business of serving the cause of life. Evil writes history in terms of rulers and regimes that rise and fall. Goodness is an underground river that turns the wheels of history, and carries life forward.  What was it that Jesus said, in his message to John in prison? The blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the poor have good news preached to them. In other words, while all the scandalous uproar is taking place on the palace dance floor of history, the power of God is quietly at work wherever people are healing, teaching, serving, liberating, loving, and caring for one another. Archbishop Desmond Tutu puts it this way: Here is our basis for hope in this world: not the absence of darkness, but the presence of light.  Well, what do you think? Where is the greater power located---with King Herod in the palace, or with John the Baptist in the basement?  You see, as we begin to prepare our hearts for the coming of Christmas---when Herod will be on the throne and a baby in a manger---the gospel writer wants us to ponder these questions. With which of these powers will we cast our lot? On whom will we pin our hopes?  Amen. "
