April-19-2015-sermon,"we give; its the size of our risk that impresses Jesus. Think about it. The person that the New Testament and Jesus handed down to history as a great example of faith was a person who threw in two bucks in the offering plate. The person Jesus wanted us to remember was a poor widow who could barely rub two dollars together! It was the size of her risk that impressed Jesus! If we put all that we have and all that we are at Gods disposal he can accomplish things through us beyond our imagination. Remember the parable of the mustard seed? It was the smallest of seeds yet it grew to be the biggest of bushes so that birds would nest in its branches. How did something so small grow into something so big? The power of God! If you are someone here today who thinks you dont have much to offer, I will say this to you: Sometimes God prefers small, simple things because it showcases his power! Sometimes when big things are given, attention is given to the giver and not on what God can do through the giver. But when God is given something small he loves impressing us by doing something extraordinary with it! Small things risked greatly for God can do awesome things. I close with a powerful example of what I am talking about. Here is a picture of Andrea and her family. She writes a blog called True stories of a Midwest Yankee. She and her family were going through a very difficult time last year. Her husband was let go from his job because of cut backs. They were barely surviving. One day she went to the grocery store with her kids and the EBT machine was down and she couldnt use her government assistance card. A lady behind her she didnt know graciously paid her bill. She was so moved by the gesture that she posted this letter on her blog: ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org Dear woman behind me in line at the grocery store, You don't know me. You have no clue what my life has been like since October 1, 2013. You have no clue that my family has gone through the wringer. You have no clue that we have faced unbelievable hardship. You have no clue we have been humiliated, humbled, destitute. What you do know is I tried to buy my kids some food and that the EBT machine was down so I couldn't buy that food. I didn't have any cash or my debit card with me. I only had my government assistance card. All you heard was me saying ""My kids are hungry now and I have no other way of paying for this."" You didn't judge me. You didn't snarl ""Maybe you should have less kids."" You didn't say ""Well, get a job and learn to support yourself."" You didn't look away in embarrassment or shame for me. You didn't make any assumptions at all. What you did was you paid that $17.38 grocery bill for us. You gave my kids bananas, yogurt, apple juice, cheese sticks, and a peach ice tea for me; a rare treat and splurge. You let me hug you.. That $17.38 may not have been a lot for you, but it was priceless to us. In the car my kids couldn't stop gushing about you; our ""angel in disguise."" They prayed for you. They prayed you would be blessed. You restored some of our lost faith. One simple and small action changed our lives. You probably have forgotten about us by now, but we haven't forgotten about you. You will forever be a part of us even though we don't even know your name. Youll never know how much the Lord can do through you until you are willing to take a risk for Him!

Many of us spend crazy amounts of time and energy trying to impress people. And the ironic thing is most of the time we dont really care for the people we are trying to impress! We dont like their company. We wouldnt go bowling with them. Our need for approval and recognition is strong that its not enough to impress the people we do like. Its like the old saying, Too many people buy things they dont need with money they dont have to impress people they dont like. Its true. Advertisers prey on our need to impress all the time. Many of the ads you see are about buying a product so you can impress other people  a car that will make people look twice, a golf club that will hit the ball farther than your buddies, a workout system that will give you a body people will envy. Of course, sometimes we try to impress people because we fear rejection. We are so afraid people will not like us for who we are that we try our very best to impress them so they will accept us. It never occurs to us that any relationship built on trying to impress rather than genuine friendship is never healthy and never lasts. But often we go ahead trying to impress anyway and it can get us into trouble. We can go into debt buying things to impress people. We can say things we would never say or tell jokes we would never tell just to impress people. We can give into peer pressure and put ourselves in comprising positions just to impress people. We can compromise our values and principals just to impress people. And often times the people we are trying to impress dont care and arent even paying attention! And we have risked and given up so much. And for what? To try to get the approval of someone we probably dont even like. The truth is a life spent trying to impress people is miserable and exhausting. I mean have you ever seen an unhappy horse or a depressed bird? No! Why? Because they are not trying to impress other birds and horses. Trying to impress others simply leads to unhappiness because we betray the person God created us to be. I like what Paul said in Galatians when he was talking about preaching the gospel instead of pleasing people. Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ. Galatians 1:10 Paul really simplifies it for us. We have two lives to choose from: A life spent pleasing people or a life spent pleasing Christ. But we cant do both. So it begs the question: Have you ever thought about what impresses Jesus? Have you ever thought about the qualities in people that he loves and admires? Have you ever thought about what causes Jesus to look twice in amazement? Lets face it. In the end, it doesnt matter what other people think of us. What matters is what Jesus thinks of us. Thats what counts. On our death bed, we are not going to be thinking about all the ways we failed at impressing people. We are not going to be thinking about the expensive car we wish we had owned or the big house we wish we could have had or the power or the money or the fame we missed out on. We are not going to be thinking about the people we failed to impress. But I tell you what we will be thinking about  the moments we made Jesus proud, those moments when we impressed Jesus. Those will be the moments that matter. Those will be moments that count. So what exactly impresses Jesus? Do we really know? What are the things he really loves and admirers? What really pleases him? Well fortunately, the gospels make that clear. The gospels provide several fascinating accounts of Jesus encountering people who really impressed and amazed him. So for the next several weeks we are going to take a look at these encounters and I hope this series motivates us to dedicate our lives impressing Jesus because that is the only life worth living. We begin with a keen and perceptive observation Jesus made about a woman who was unaware that Jesus was even watching her. And the same is true of us. We often go about our lives unaware or forgetting that Jesus is observing us. Are we acting in a way that impresses him or disappoints him? Well the lady Jesus watched one day impressed the heck out of him. Lets look at what happened: Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Mark 12:41 So Jesus was hanging out around the temple and he decided to do some people watching. Have you ever done that? Just sat in a public place and watched people? Brandy and I love doing that. You can learn a lot about people just by watching them walking through an airport, shopping at the mall or interacting with someone at the bank. Well, Jesus was doing just that. He decided to watch people walk into the temple and throw in their offering. In those days when you walked into the temple there was a container you could throw your offering into. It looked like an upside down trumpet. This money was used to take care of the expenses of the temple. So Jesus was just sitting there close enough to the entrance to the temple to watch people walk by and throw their offering in. What did he observe? Many rich people threw in large amounts. But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents. Mark 12:42 As Jesus is people watching near the temple he sees a bunch of wealthy folks casually throw in large amounts of money. For them these large amounts were just a drop in the bucket. They had so much. It was nothing for them to give large amounts out of their abundance. But then Jesus watched carefully as a poor woman with no husband, children in tow and very little in her pocket walked humbly to the offering container and dropped in two small coins. Now, heres a picture of what the two coins this widow threw in probably looked like (the widows mite). For us, those two Roman coins would have been worth about two dollars. And thats all she had! This really impressed Jesus. Take a look: Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. Mark 12:43 Jesus was so impressed with this woman that he called over his disciples and said, Hey guys, come over here. Get over here! You see that woman over there? Take a good look at her. She just gave more than anyone who came through the temple today! How much money are you talking about Lord? replied the disciples. Im not talking about money Jesus said. Well what was Jesus talking about? They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everythingall she had to live on. Mark 12:44 You see, Jesus was amazed at this woman because she didnt know where her next meal was coming from. She didnt have any means or resources. In those days women had no rights and if they did not have husbands they were left completely in the cold. She was barely scraping by. Barely surviving! And yet she put everything she had into the treasury. For Jesus it wasnt about the size of her donation; it was about the size of her risk. It was about the size of her trust. What impressed Jesus was that she risked everything for God. He said those who gave a lot didnt risk anything. Dropping those large donations in the bucket didnt cost them anything! But what the widow gave cost her everything! Jesus was impressed because she risked everything for God. Have you ever impressed Jesus that much? Have you ever risked that much for God? I tell you it does impress the heck out of Jesus. Have you ever put everything you are and all that you have in the hands of God and have been terrified about what was going to happen? If youve ever done that, Jesus is impressed. Jesus is impressed with folks who get to a place where they have risked so much, given so much, sacrificed so much, that all they can do is rely on God. Have you ever done that? I have discovered in my life and faith that when we arrive at that level of risk Jesus is so impressed that he jumps in and does extraordinary things through us. Pasadena Community Church is the vital church it is today because the ancestors of our church were willing to take a great risk. Back in 1929 the Bishop of Florida appointed J. Wallace Hamilton to this church. Guess how many they had in his first service? 34. Guess what the total offering was? $5.75! It was 1929. It was the great depression. So what did Hamilton do? He decided to risk the life of the church by moving it to a new location seven miles away, where we stand today. Back then there was nothing here. It was like moving the church to a ghost town. People thought Hamilton was nuts! But he took a risk, knowing that God was calling him to do it. He also knew if he did it, the church would grow. And grow it did! What God did through Hamilton and Pasadena Community Church was no small miracle. From the churchs humble beginnings, which included sparse crowds, living through the Great Depression and a second world war, Hamilton was able to grow Pasadena Community Church to a membership of over 3,500 members. Attendance on some Sundays reached over 10,000. People would be here on vacation and if they couldnt get a seat in the sanctuary they would stay in their cars and listen to the service in a drive in church type of setting. The church grew because Hamilton and the ancestors of PCC took a great risk for God! Just imagine what God can continue to do through us if we are willing to take a great risk for him! Jesus is impressed with those who take greats risks for God! Hes impressed with those who are willing to go outside their comfort zone and not always play it safe. This is what I have learned: Youll never know how much the Lord can do through you until you are willing to take a risk for Him. A group of California high school students had spent three months preparing and planning to go to Mexico during Easter break to help the poor. They had prayed that God would use them in a mighty way. Anticipating an exciting week of ministry, they journeyed to a small church near Mexicali. Upon arriving at the small rural village on a Sunday morning, the students saw that the church where they were going to serve had been badly burned. The roof had caved in, and only the four walls remained. They cautiously made their way into what was left of the building, while a hymn was being sung in Spanish. They were greeted by the puzzled stares of a weary, discouraged Mexican pastor and nine parishioners who were midway through their Sunday morning service. It was apparent that the congregation had never received the groups letters explaining their plans to serve and had no idea that the group was coming to spend the week with them. At the end of the hymn, the pastor stopped the service, walked back to the group of high school students and said, Qu pasa? (Which the group interpreted to mean, What in the world are you rich white kids doing in our church?) After a long silence, one of the students spoke: We are Christians, and we are here to serve. On hearing this the pastors eyes brimmed with tears. Some people in the village burned down our church six months ago, he explained. Weve been praying that God would send help, but we had given up hope that help was ever coming. Praise be to God! The thirty-five high school students were stunned silent. They had heard many times that God wanted to use them; now they were experiencing it for the first time. Amazed, one of the students turned to another and said, I cant believe it. Were an answer to prayer! God does want to use us and he willif we will only put our lives in his hands and be willing to take a risk. We can be the answer to someones prayer. We can make a difference in this world if we are willing to take a risk for God. Youll never know how much the Lord can do through you until you are willing to take a risk for Him! Does this mean God wants us to make dumb choices and be reckless and foolish? No, but it does mean that the only way we can do great things for God is if we are willing to take a great risks for him. And there are times when God calls us to do that. You may ask, How will I know if God wants me to take a risk for him? All I can say is, youll know. If youve prayed about it, youll know. You will know in your heart. Is God calling you to risk something  time, money, resources, yourself? Remember we may fail God, but God never fails us! You may be thinking, Well I dont have much to risk. I dont have much to give. What do I have to offer? Remember, its not the size of what "
April-26-2015-sermon,"doubt your doubts and experience the hope of God in your life! If you are someone struggling with doubt today, here is your homework: Pick one thing you have doubts about or are struggling with today. Just pick one thing. Give it to God and pray, Lord, Im expecting you to act on this. I expect it. Just give it to God with an expectant faith and watch what happens. He may not act or answer in the way you want him to, but he will act. I promise you that! I will give you one of the greatest examples of expectant faith in my life. Ever since I was in junior high I prayed and expected God to provide a wonderful woman for me to marry. I got started early because I knew I would be a challenge! In high school I dated a few girls. They were nice but none of them were the one. Then I got to college and I surely expected God to provide the right woman there. I dated a couple of strange girls and became friends with many wonderful girls but still did not find the one. I saw my buddies finding the right women and was jealous but I kept expecting God to provide. Then when I went off to seminary I definitely expected God to provide the right woman for me there. I dated couple of girls in seminary who were stranger than the ones in college! I didnt expect some of the women in seminary to be that strange, but they were! Wow! I was disappointed but I kept expecting God to provide. In my second year of seminary I got a job as Minister of Evangelism at Northside UMC near downtown Atlanta. One of my roles was to help new people join the church. I heard that there was a woman named Brandy working in our recreation department who was interested in joining. So one afternoon I went to look for her in the gym. When I walked in the gym I noticed a beautiful woman in a red dress. I found out it was Brandy. I thought, It would be my honor and privilege to speak with her about joining the church. Im just a humble servant and this is my job. ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org Needless to say, there was immediate chemistry. The second time we talked we talked for over three hours. We were engaged in three months! She swept me off my feet. I often joke that Brandy wanted to join the church and when she met me she got a lot more church than she bargained for! Im so blessed to call Brandy my wife. What a woman! Jesus is impressed when we expect him to act in our lives. When we expect the Lord to act in our lives, our confidence in him moves him and he responds. David understood this well. Thats why the Bible calls David a man after Gods own heart. David's verses throughout the Bible are filled with expectation. Take a look: ""In the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation."" (Psalm 5:3 NIV) Psalm 130:5 (TLB) says, ""I wait expectantly, trusting God to help, for He has promised."" I can't guarantee that every time you give something to God expecting him to act that you'll always get what you are expecting. But I can tell you this: If you expect Jesus to act in your life, you can expect two things  Jesus will act and respond in some way and your percentage of answered prayer will increase dramatically. I have seen it in my own life as well as in the lives of others. Maybe most of all when we have an attitude of expectancy about the Lord there will be a peace and joy in our hearts that we cant find anywhere else. Repeat this Psalm with me: ""I will keep expecting you to help me. I praise you more and more""! (Psalm 71:14 TLB) Jesus is impressed when we expect him to act in our lives. Amen. Pasadena Community Church WWWWWhhhhho ooooAAAAArrrrre eeeeYYYYYooooou uuuuTTTTTrrrrryyyyyiiiiinnnnng ggggttttto ooooIIIIImmmmmppppprrrrreeeeessssssssss? ????~ The Greatest Compliment Jesus Ever Gave Sunday, April 26, 2015 Matthew 8:5 -13 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today I continue our series, Who are you trying to impress? If we are honest, we all have the desire to impress people. We want to be like, accepted, recognized and so we often spend a lot of time and energy trying to impress others. But a life spent impressing people is exhausting and miserable because we often compromise who God created us to be. We have two choices: we can spend our lives impressing others or impressing Jesus. But we cant do both. Real life is found when we spend our lives impressing Jesus. At the end of our lives we are not going to be thinking about all the ways we succeeded or failed at impressing others. We will be thinking about all the ways we succeeded or failed at impressing Jesus. Those will be the moments that matter. Those will be the moments that count. So what exactly impresses Jesus? Do we really know? What are the things he really loves and admirers? What really pleases him? Well fortunately, the gospels make that clear. The gospels provide several fascinating accounts of Jesus encountering people who really impressed and amazed him. So for the next several weeks we are going to take a look at these encounters and learn from them. I hope this series motivates all of us to dedicate our lives to impressing Jesus because that is the only life worth living. Last week we discovered that Jesus was very impressed with a poor widow who gave everything she had to God. Jesus observed a woman give her last two dollars to the temple. Unlike the wealthy people who gave out of their abundance, the women gave everything. We learned that Jesus is impressed with those who take great risks for God. With that in mind we learned that we will never know how much the Lord can do through us until we are willing to take a great risk for him. Today we turn our attention to another person Jesus was extremely impressed with. In fact, he impressed Jesus so much that he received what is perhaps the greatest compliment Jesus ever gave anyone. Yeah, I know! Pretty impressive, huh? Imagine getting a huge compliment from Jesus! Thats worth living for, isnt it? Funny thing is the person who received the greatest compliment from Jesus was the most unlikely person in the world. And therein lies the lesson for us today. Before I introduce you to this unlikely person and why and how he impressed Jesus so much, I want to tell you how important todays message could be for you. Todays message has the power to help you overcome your doubts. I imagine there is a lot of doubt in the sanctuary today. None of us are immune to doubt. As humans, it is often natural to doubt. We doubt our faith. We doubt God. We doubt the people we are supposed to trust. We doubt ourselves. To a certain point, doubt is healthy and normal. It leads to greater truth and answers. But doubt can easily turn into a dark diabolical demon in our minds and hearts. We can get stuck in our doubts. Instead of being a motivating tool for deeper answers, doubt can pull us down into the pit of sadness, discouragement, bitterness and cynicism. Ever been there? You may be there right now. Maybe you have doubted your faith and God for so long that it has been forever since you were hopeful about anything. Maybe an experience of betrayal has caused you to doubt people when they get close to you and its hard for you to have healthy relationships. Perhaps you have been suffering so long with an illness that you doubt you will ever find relief and healing. Maybe a shattered dream has caused you to doubt new dreams. Or maybe all the pain, war and violence in the world has caused you to doubt humanity. I get it. I certainly have gone through periods of great doubt and darkness. I know what it is like to feel stuck in the darkness of doubt. It is a very hopeless and helpless feeling. If you are there today, you are not alone. However, I want to share with you today how I have learned to doubt my doubts and live with confidence in God. I want to share with you how you can experience the hope and power of God again in your life. And that lesson comes from the most unlikely person in the gospels. His story appears in both Matthew and Luke. Today we are going to look at his story from Matthew. We find it in Matthew 8, beginning with verse 5. Lets take a look. It is a powerful story that just may turn your life around: When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him seeking help. Matthew 8:5 We find Jesus at the height of his ministry. He is going to town to town teaching and healing people. Word about him is spreading like crazy. Everyone is starting to hear about this Jesus of Nazareth. So when he enters this town of Capernaum everyone in the town finds out about it. And the first person who approaches Jesus is not a devout Jew or someone who followed Jesus, but a Roman centurion! A Roman Centurion was a high ranking officer in the Roman army. Only the strongest, loyal, and most disciplined men became centurions. This man had command over hundreds of men who followed every order he gave. What I want you to know about centurions is that they were considered pagans by Jews. They worshipped other gods and did terrible things. And yet here was this centurion asking Jesus for help. What did he need help with? Lets take a look: Lord, he said, my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly. Matthew 8:6 The centurion had a servant. Shows you how important he was in that society. But this centurion was not like other centurions. He had compassion on his servants. Most misused and abused their servants. If servants disobeyed them or were not useful, they would kill them or sell them off to another abusive centurion. But this Centurion cared about his servant. His servant was suffering terribly, unable to move. Who knows what his malady was. All we know is that the centurion cared enough about this man that he sought help from Jesus of Nazareth. This was a very odd move for a Roman centurion who worshipped other gods and lived a pagan lifestyle. But I want you to notice something about what the centurion said to Jesus and what he didnt say. Notice that the centurion simply stated his problem to Jesus. He didnt make any request. He didnt cry out, Lord youve got to do something.youve got to heal him.youve got to.. . Thats what most of us do isnt it? When we pray to Jesus, we make it plain what we want and what we need, dont we? Thats not what the centurion did. All he said to Jesus was, My servant is at home suffering terribly. Why didnt he make a request? We are going to find out why in a second and the why is huge. So how did Jesus respond to the centurion? What did Jesus do? Did he say, Away with you wicked centurion! Away with you, you pagan violent man! No. This was Jesus who had great love for everyone, especially outsiders. Look at Jesus response: Jesus said to him, Shall I come and heal him? Matthew 8:7 Jesus response was, Okay your servant is suffering.and..what? Do you want me to come to your home and heal him? Is that what you want? Everyone tells me what they want me to do.you just stated your problem.just tell me what you want you want me to come to your house, just tell me where you live and I will come over and heal him. Watch what happens next: The centurion replied, Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. Matthew 8:8 What? Why would the centurion seek Jesus out for help if he thought he was too unworthy for Jesus to enter his home? You see, the centurion was knowledgeable of the Jewish faith. He knew no self respecting practicing Jew would enter the home of a pagan centurion. Their homes were unclean to Jews. Centurions were vile characters to Jews and they would not dream of entering their home. The centurion knew this and he probably thought Jesus wouldnt go near his home. But this is Jesus we are talking about and he never let rules stop him from loving and helping people. Still, the centurion did not want Jesus to come to his house. This is strange, isnt it? He stated his problem to Jesus. His servant was suffering and yet he did not want Jesus to come to his home to heal him. Jesus must have said, So you tell me your servant is suffering but you dont want me to come to your house and heal him? Well then, what do you want me to do exactly? Look at what he says to Jesus. It is astounding: Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, Go, and he goes; and that one, Come, and he comes. I say to my servant, Do this, and he does it. Matthew 8:8-9 Amazing! He said, You dont need to come to my house to heal him. Just say the word. You can do it right now, right here. Just say hes healed, and he will be healed. I mean, thats how it works in my world. I command a huge army. I follow orders and many men follow my orders. If I want something done, its done. Period. Isnt this how this works? Ive heard you have great power. You can just heal him right now. Just say the word. Wow! Now, understand, this centurion still has not made any request of Jesus. He has simply stated his problem and said to Jesus, Just say the word. Simple, confident and clear. No begging. No bargaining. Well Jesus was wowed. Look at what Jesus said next. It is the greatest compliment Jesus ever gave anyone: When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. Matthew 8:10 This is unbelievable. Jesus said this centurion had greater faith than all the amazing characters in the Bible  Abraham, Moses, Jacob, David, the Prophets, etc. Jesus said this centurion had greater faith than all the heroes of the Bible who did amazing things for God! Thats huge! Think about it! That is a grand statement! And it wasnt as if Jesus was saying this about a devout Jew. That would have been astonishing enough. He said it about an unclean, pagan man who the Jewish leaders hated and avoided! What does that tell you? Human beings judge people by their outward appearance but God looks on the heart. And when Jesus saw this centurions heart and heard what he said, he was so impressed, so amazed, that he basically said, The faith of this centurion is the greatest faith I have ever seen. Only twice in the gospels do we find Jesus amazed at anyone or anything. First, Jesus was amazed at the lack of faith of his own people. Second, we find in our text for today that Jesus was amazed at the great faith of a man who was considered an outsider. What was it about the great faith of the centurion that amazed Jesus? What moved Jesus so much that he gave him the greatest compliment in the world? Well, we find the answer to that in the last thing Jesus said to the centurion: Then Jesus said to the centurion, Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would. And his servant was healed at that moment. Matthew 8:13 Let it be done just as you believed it would. What was it about the faith of the centurion that amazed Jesus and impressed him so much? He expected Jesus to act. Okay, its done, just as you expected it to be done. The centurion didnt hope or wish or beg or plea or bargain or doubt when he approached Jesus that day. He simply expected Jesus to do something. He expected Jesus to respond to his problem. He expected Jesus to help. He never made a request. He never even said, Please heal him. He simply heard Jesus had the greatest power in the world, simply stated his problem and simply expected Jesus to respond with his power at that very moment. And Jesus did, just as the centurion expected. So what is the lesson for us today? What impresses the heck out of Jesus? Jesus is impressed when we expect him to act in our lives. The key word there is expect. Jesus is impressed when we expect him to act in our lives. Sounds simple, doesnt it? It is. Too simple for most of us. When was the last time you were so confident in God that you expected him to act in your life? Has the ever been a time you were expectant about God doing anything in your life? Do you have a problem in your life today? Do you expect God to respond to it or do you wish or hope he will? Do you have an issue in your life today that you cant solve on your own? Do you expect God to help you solve it or do you bargain with God about it? You see, for most of us, our faith often takes the form of wishing or bargaining with God. Some of us just wish and hope and cross our fingers to God. And some of us bargain with God, Ive been good, Lord.remember when I did that nice thing the other day.throw me a bone, God. And while we are bargaining with God we forget we have a God of grace who has graciously loved us, saved us, and forgiven us. We dont have to bargain with a gracious God. When was the last time you expected God to act in your life? For example, when you got up, got dressed and came to worship today, were you expecting to hear or experiencing something from God that would make a difference in your life or did you wish that the preacher wouldnt go long today so you could beat the Baptists to Waffle House? When you read your Bible and pray, do you expect to be inspired by God? Do you expect to be moved by God? When you get up in the morning do you expect to experience God during the day? Do we, at PCC, expect God to do great things through our church or do we simply expect to pay the bills and be a religious shop? Perhaps you are thinking, I would love to have that kind of confidence but my doubts are so heavy and strong. Well let me proclaim boldly today: Its time to start doubting your doubts and expecting God to act in your life! Its time to doubt your doubts and expecting Gods power in your life! Its time to "

So Carl makes a promise to Ellie that one day they will travel to Paradise Falls. Well, unfortunately Ellie dies before Carl can fulfill his promise. Years later, Carl is an elderly man who is forced by the court to live in a retirement home. But Carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Elliehe turns his house into an airship using thousands of helium balloons. On his voyage he also brings along a boy named Russell who needs to earn his final merit badge by helping the elderly. Along the way Carl and Russell pick up a bird named Kevin in search of his baby chicks. They all become good friends on their trip to Paradise Falls.

Carl chooses to save his house and he and Russell finally arrive in Paradise Falls.

I am going to tell how you can experience new life today. Because the promise of Easter is that the same power of God that raised Jesus from the dead can give you new life today. Its not just about when you die, although that is true as well. Easter promises that our lives can be resurrected from disappointment, discouragement, defeat, shame, guilt, and anything else that has kept us down in life. Thats what the eggs and the lilies and the music and the energy of today is about. Because Christ lives we can live! His Spirit can give us joy, meaning, purpose, hope, and love and those things can be the dominant forces in our lives. I am sure for many of you that sounds really good, doesnt it? Youre sick and tired of the way your life is. Its been a long time since you have been happy and joyful about anything. Life has just become a rote routine of work where you pray for Friday. Life is the same thing over and over again with no end in sight. Or maybe some of you have experienced set backs or tragedy and you wonder if those events will be the defining moments of your life. Perhaps you have made some bad decisions and you feel that those bad decisions will follow you around like a grim reaper the rest of your life. You are ready for a change. You are ready for new life and joy. You are ready for a resurrection. Of course, I am sure there are some of you who think that all of this sounds too good to be true. You consider yourself a realistic person, perhaps even a bit cynical and skeptical. Youre here because it is tradition or because you get a good brunch out of it. But, truthfully, you dont believe all this resurrection business. You cant really believe any of this is true. A nice story, yeah, but fictional. And even if it was true maybe you think your life is too far gone to be resurrected in any way. You are who you are, life is what it is, and thats that way it will always be. Now I am certain there are many of you here who do believe in the resurrection of Christ but you just cant believe that same resurrection power can make any difference to your life today. There was a time as a child when you believed in it and you had a lot of hope. But now those ideas seem like a dream. Life now is more life taking than it is life giving. Well, what I am going to reveal to you today from the Easter story will help you discover the hope you are desperate for and the new life you have been looking for. If you give me just a few minutes I believe you will truly see and believe that God can resurrect your life. For the resurrection of Christ is just as real today as it was 2,000 years ago. I remember one Easter a few years ago a lady came through the receiving line to greet me and she said something to me that I will never forget. She said, Nice message pastor, but you left something out. I said, What is that? She said, You never told me how. I replied, How what? You never told me how to experience new life. Then it dawned on me. For so long I had just told the Easter story and I thought that was enough. But that isnt enough. I had never really told people how to apply the Easter message to their lives. So thats what I am going to do today. I am not just going to tell you the story of Easter which you have heard a million times. I am not just going to proclaim that Jesus is risen and that he is alive. I am not just going to tell you that because Jesus lives you can have hope. I am going to tell you how you can experience the resurrection for yourself not matter who you are or what you have done. I am going to tell you how you can apply the power behind the most important event in history to your life today. So lets take a closer look at what Christians believe is the most pivotal event in history  Easter. And I want us to take a look at the Easter story from the gospel of Mark because I believe Marks perspective on the Easter story is the most fascinating of all four gospels. This is how it begins: When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus body. Mark 16:1 Now that seems rather odd doesnt it? Jesus is dead. Hes been shut up in a tomb and yet these three ladies went to Bed, Bath and Beyond right after Jesus died and bought some spices to put on Jesus dead body? Why anoint a dead body? Thats weird. Whats going on? Well, it wasnt to embalm the body. It was to reduce the stench of the decomposing body. They believed Jesus was dead. And they were just following Jewish custom. But they had a bigger issue to deal with. Take a look: Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb and they asked each other, Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb? Mark 16:2-3 So these three ladies who loved Jesus so much and wanted to do one more nice thing to honor his memory were walking to Jesus tomb. And you can imagine their pain. They had just witnessed their beloved teacher and friend getting executed in the most brutal way imaginable. Their hopes and dreams were shattered. They were probably numb with grief as they walked to the tomb. Suddenly it dawned on them that they would not be able to roll the stone away from the tomb. It was just too big, too heavy. And I imagine they thought, Well, we probably wont be able to do this because we simply will not be able to roll that big stone out of the way. We probably will not be able to do one more honorable thing for our Lord. But lets just go there so at least we can say we tried. Look what happens next: But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. Mark 16:4 Heres a picture that is a good representation of what the tomb of Jesus looked like with the stone rolled away. This is something of what these women found when they got to the tomb. The stone had been rolled away! They had not prepared for that! They thought the tomb would be sealed shut with something that could never be moved. But when they got there it had been rolled away! Look what happens next: As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. Dont be alarmed, he said. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. Mark 16:5-6 Wow! So they enter the tomb, not sure what they would find. And there is this young messenger in a white robe sitting in the very place Jesus body had been. We dont know if he was an angel or a human messenger. But whoever he was he scared the living daylights out of them. Did someone move his body? What happened? And the messenger made it clear that Jesus had risen from the dead! He was gone? Where did he go? Well lets look: But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you. Mark 16:7 The messenger said to the women, Dont just stand here with your mouths open! Did you hear what I said? Your Lord has risen! Go tell everybody the good news! Everything he said is true. He is alive. He is risen! Tell his disciples! He will be in Galilee! So you can imagine how thrilled these three ladies must have been, right? Their teacher, their Savior was truly the Savior! They thought, Everything he said was true! He is risen! Halleluiah! Lets go spread the good news! Thats what they thought and did, right? Nope. Look at the end of the story in Mark. Here it is: Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid. Mark 16:8 What? Huh? Thats it?! They ran away. Didnt say a word. They were terrified. The end. Now, I know some of you are thinking, Wheres the rest of it? Where are the dramatic appearances of Jesus to his disciples found in the other gospels? Wheres the joy? This is no way to end a resurrection story! Well, the church in later years thought so too, which is why they added the rest of the story to the gospel of Mark in later years. But most experts believe this is how the original manuscript of Mark ends. This is how Mark wanted to end his gospel and Easter story, with the word afraid. Doesnt make sense, right? I mean, Mark knew the stories of Jesus appearing to his disciples after his death. He knew them well. But he chose to leave them out. He chose not to include them. And the big question is why? And, even more importantly, why were these three women so afraid? Why were they paralyzed by fear after receiving the greatest news in the world? The answer reveals why so many of us are held back from experiencing resurrection in our lives. The answer reveals why so many of us dont have the joy, hope and peace of Easter in our lives. So why did Mark end his gospel with the women being afraid even though he knew the rest of the story? Because he wanted us to know the most important thing about Easter: Resurrection Brings Profound Change As the women stood there with their mouths to the floor, they were not terrified because Jesus had risen. They were terrified because they were confronted with the reality that everything in their lives was about to change. Their lives were about to be turned upside down by the living power of Christ. And, folks, when you are confronted with that truth it is terrifying. And so as Mark ends his gospel he is saying, Jesus is really alive. Are you ready? Are you prepared for the transformation he comes to bring to your life? If that scares you, you are in good company. It scared the three women at the tomb. I like how Sara Ofner-Seals puts it, Whenever we encounter new things in life we arent prepared for, it often scares us. We try to ignore it. We look the other way or we run in the opposite direction. We just arent ready to let go of what was in order to receive what may be. We just arent ready to roll back that stone and look inside. We like to cling to what is familiar, even if the familiar is unhealthy (parkchurchnorwich.org). So often what prevents us from experiencing resurrection is our unwillingness to let go of those things in life that are taking our life away. The power of Christ is available, but we are unavailable. The question of Easter is this: What are the stones in my life that need to be rolled away? What do I need to let go of, what am I afraid to let go of, in order to experience resurrection? Am I willing to let go of those things that are preventing me from experiencing resurrection in my life? Am I willing to let go of that bitterness, that resentment, that habit, that relationship, that attitude, that anger, that pride, that sin, that secret? Am I willing to roll those stones away to find new life? If you are, here is the good news: the moment we are willing to roll that stone away and receive Gods resurrection power we find what the women found at the tomb  God has already rolled our stone away. Again, Ofner-Seals gives a great insight: When those three women arrived at the tomb that morning they found that even in the midst of their doubt and fear God had already been at work. The key was they showed up and were willing to roll the stone away. And thats all God asks of us  to simply let go of those stones and desire to roll them away to make room for Gods resurrection power. We dont have to do the heavy lifting. God does that. All we have to do is let it go and allow God to roll it away. You see, its okay if you are afraid and have doubts. Thats normal. The three women were terrified. The disciples were terrified. They had scattered. We just have to trust God and know that our resurrection is on other side of our fear. The resurrection we desire is on the other side of our fear. We simply must be willing to step out of our fear and step in to Gods best for us. I am a true connoisseur of great art and film. And this week as I was preparing this message I thought of a film that only true lovers and critics of great film can appreciate  the Pixar movie UP. How many of you have seen this movie?

August-16-2015-sermon,"Not too long ago, Swift received a message from a 14 year old fan named Hannah. Hannah expressed to Swift how she was being bullied at school and how much it was affecting her. Swift could have just messaged back some sappy line or even quoted her song, Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate Shake it off. Instead, Taylor took the time out of her crazy schedule to write a long heartfelt message on Instagram to Hannah. Here is a portion of it: ""Reading this made me so sad because I love seeing you in your videos and photos being so happy and wide eyed, like the world isn't as harsh and unfair as it actually is. I hate thinking about your pretty face covered in tears, but I know why you're crying because I've been in your place. This isn't a high school thing or an age thing. It's a people thing. A life thing. It doesn't stop. It doesn't end or change. ""People cut other people down for entertainment, amusement, out of jealousy, because of something broken inside them. Or for no reason at all. It's just what they do, and you're a target because you live your life loudly and boldly. You're bright and joyful and so many people are cynical. They won't understand you and they won't understand me. ""But the only way they win is if your tears turn to stone and make you bitter like them. Don't let them change you or stop you from singing or dancing around to your favorite song. ""Every time someone picks on me, I'll think of you in the hopes that every time someone picks on you, you'll think of me and how we have this thread that connects us. Keep walking in the sunlight. ""Forever on your side, Taylor."" Hannah was overwhelmed by this note and she said she would never forget it. Let me tell you something. That note that Taylor wrote was more important than all of her hit songs, success, money and achievements put together. And she knows it. Thats why she keeps doing it. Let me give you a quiz. I want you to try to answer these questions: 1. Name the five wealthiest people in the world. 2. Name the last five Heisman trophy winners. 3. Name the last five winners of the Miss America Contest. 4. Name ten people who have won the Nobel or Pulitzer Prize. 5. Name the last half dozen Academy Award winners for best actor and actress. 6. Name the last decade's worth of World Series winners. How did you do? None of us remember the headliners of yesterday. The applause dies. Awards tarnish. Achievements are forgotten. Accolades and certificates are buried with their owners. Here's another quiz. See how you do: 1. List a few teachers who aided your journey through school... 2. Name three friends who have helped you through a difficult time. 3. Name five people who have taught you something worthwhile. 4. Think of a few people who have made you feel appreciated and special. 5. Think of five people you enjoy spending time with. Its easier to answer those questions isnt it? What does that tell you? The people who make a difference in your life are NOT the ones with the most credentials, the most money, or the most awards. They are the ones who care. They are the ones who are faithful, who serve, who show unusual kindness and love. You really want to be a servant of Christ who makes a difference? Show unusual kindness every day. And dont just be a Bible studier; Be a Bible doer! -J.D.

Its been pretty straight forward. The world tells us we should measure our lives by how much money we have, what cars we own, the achievements we have made, and the power and status we have attained. But, in the end, is this really how we should measure our lives? In the end, is this how we want to be remembered? This series is based on a great book by Clay Christiansen entitled How Will You Measure Your Life? Christensen is a Harvard Business professor who surprisingly tells his students that their lives should not be measured by their success and achievements in business. In the prologue Christiansen explains that as a Harvard alumnus he has learned through attending many class reunions and observing many of his classmates that success does not bring true happiness and meaning. Although many of his classmates have high paying jobs and are at the pinnacle of success they are personally miserable and their lives are a mess. So Christiansen warns his students not to make success the source of their happiness because it will never bring contentment and meaning to their lives. So what will bring contentment and meaning to our lives? How should we measure our lives? Well, the Bible is real clear about that. The first week we learned that God measures our lives by how well we love. Last week we learned that God measures our lives by how much of ourselves we give away. If you are loving you are giving. Gods love leads to generosity. Today we focus on serving. God measures our lives by who and how we serve. The love of God inside us leads us to serve, not to be served. Jesus said, The greatest among you will be a servant. Jesus also said of himself, I came not to be served but to serve. I have given you an example that you should do as I have done for you. It is clear. God measures our lives by how well we serve others. In the Kingdom of God servants are the celebrities. If we are serious about showing the world that God is love we will be serious about serving others. This is what translates in our culture today. People have grown tired of religious trappings and talk. The world doesnt need another sermon; it needs servants. The world doesnt need another religious platitude; it needs caring people. The world doesnt need more Christians screaming in judgment; it needs people who will give a cup of cold water in Jesus name. The world doesnt need more guilt laid upon it; it needs more people who will embody the love of Jesus. The world needs people who will rise above hate, cynicism, and complacency, and penetrate this hurting world with loving service and sacrifice. Thats when people will start wondering who Christians are and, more importantly who Jesus is. Thats when people will start asking us about Jesus and desire a relationship with him. People dont respond to words; they respond to action. And serving is putting Gods love into action. I know someone who lives near a church and every time he walks his kids to school he checks out what the marquee of the church has to say. Usually it is a clever quote like Its hard to stumble when you are on your knees or Dont give up. Moses was once a basket case. But there was a span of about a month when the marquee advertised an upcoming sermon series. It invited folks to come to worship every Sunday in November and hear a life changing message on faith and family. As he walked his kids to school he thought, Does this church think that Ive been ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org waiting on just this moment when someone would solve my problems with a sermon series in November? I cant imagine someone who doesnt follow Jesus giving up their peaceful-easy-feeling Starbucks Sunday morning to go to a place where they didnt know anyone because they saw a church sign about an awesome sermon series about faith and family in the month of November. Well, as a preacher, that stung a little. I have a high view of preaching. I think it does make a difference. Otherwise I wouldnt do it! But the guy had a point. Engaging sermons may attract some people but not everyone, especially those who have no interest in Christianity or have had bad experiences in churches. If people dont follow Jesus and are happy with their lives why would they give up going to the beach, playing golf, or sleeping in and reading the Sunday paper to hear a sermon? So what will attract people to Jesus? What will make them stop and think about what Christianity is really all about? Quite often it is not a sermon; it is someone who is serving in Jesus name. When people see followers of Jesus serving they take notice because they are not all talk; they are all action. And that translates in our cynical culture today. So what does it really mean to serve Jesus? How do Christ followers serve? Jesus didnt give us an instructional manual on how to serve. He simply gave us an example and a very powerful one. But what made it so powerful? And what has made Christian service so unique and powerful over the last 2,000 years? Well, I think there is one distinguishing characteristic of a servant of Christ that can help all of us be more effective at serving in Jesus name. It is a characteristic that will cause people to stop and take notice and want to know more about Jesus. In fact, through the years it has been this particular characteristic that has drawn people to Christ more than anything else. There is a text in scripture that expresses this distinguishing characteristic. It is found in the book of Acts. It appears in a powerful story of the Apostle Paul getting shipwrecked with 275 other prisoners. For 14 days Paul and the rest of the prisoners were on a ship headed to Rome. They were tossed about by terrible storms. They didnt think they would survive. Eventually they got shipwrecked near the island of Malta. Paul and the rest of the prisoners jumped from the sinking ship and headed for land. 276 prisoners were tired and cold. They didnt know what they were going to find when they got to the island. Much to their relief and delight, they were given a warm welcome. Take a look: Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta. The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold. Acts 28:1-2 Now thats a powerful picture! Paul and the other 275 prisoners were exhausted and tired and cold. I am sure they half expected to be seen as invaders and attacked by the natives of Malta. Instead, they received a warm and kind welcome. The natives of Malta showed unusual kindness to them by having a warm fire and a friendly smile ready for them when they showed up on shore. Now, think about it. What if the 276 half dead people who washed up on shore saw a sign on the shore line that said Join us each week in November because we will have a great fire each Sunday? We probably wouldnt be talking about it two thousand years later! And some think that is enough today. Just put up a sign about a sermon or program and they will come. No, that wont cut it! Instead, we need to do what the natives of Malta did. Meet people at their point of need and show them unusual kindness. Unusual kindness. Thats it, you know. When Christ followers serve the distinguishing characteristic is unusual kindness. The distinguishing characteristic of Christian service is unusual kindness. You see, the church grew not through coercion, force or manipulation; it grew through fascination! Christ followers have always been unusually kind. That is what has caused people to stop and take notice. Unusual kindness is what Christ shared with the world and it is what Christ followers are to be known for. It is what our churches are to be known for. Because there are many cold, tired, and lonely people in the world who have experienced rejection, betrayal, crisis, and pain and they desperately need someone to show them unusual kindness. Thats what I want our church to be known for! And we are well on our way to doing that! I want people to say, Oh you go to Pasadena! Thats the church that shows unusual kindness in our community. They dont just put up a sign and say come worship with us. They dont just have good programs and invite others to join. That church goes out into the neighborhoods, schools, communities and builds fires for those who are cold. They welcome those who have been rejected. They encourage the discouraged and nourish the hungry. I love that church. They are all about action! You see, if we are going to really make a difference in this community for Christ its going to take unusual kindness. Its going to take well built fires and the kind of welcome that doesnt wait for the hurting and broken to come to us. Instead we must go to them. Gods love is not the kind of love that waits for people to come. It actually goes out in search of people who desperately need love. Our church is already doing this in powerful ways. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago I joined our hospitality ministry, Love in Action at Pinellas Hope. Pinellas Hope is a powerful ministry to the homeless. They create a community for the homeless and offer them ways to heal and get back on their feet. They also provide meals for them every day. Our church felt called by God to use our glorious kitchen for more than just feeding ourselves. We are using it to prepare delicious meals for the hungry. So a team of us went out there to serve a meal to 200 of the homeless in this community. Here are some pictures. And let me tell you folks, to the 200 homeless it was like we were serving a banquet from heaven. We served BBQ pork, mac n cheese, corn bread, vegetable salad, and cookies. They came through the line and their eyes got real big! Then they came back for seconds and for thirds! There was a touching moment. A man came running in to the kitchen and said, Ive got to know! Who made the mac n cheese? And we pointed to Anita. He ran over to Anita, gave her a big hug and said, That is the best mac n cheese I ever had in my life! As Al Tompkins said, That day we were the mac n cheese of Christ. Later, I was speaking to one of the men living in the Pinellas Hope community. He said, Thank you so much so much for coming. I have never seen us so happy to eat a meal. You have no idea. Today we felt like we were eating at the Ritz Carlton! You want to know how much it costs us to feed such a delicious meal to 200 of the homeless at Pinellas Hope? $400 dollars. It only costs that much to show unusual kindness to those who are hungry and tired. I love what Bob Goff has to say about serving Christ in his book Love Does. He said the way he learned how to really serve Christ and show unusual kindness was by quitting Bible study. Thats right. He said he became a better Jesus follower when he quit Bible study. He said Bible study just didnt do it for him. It was like studying about God instead of bonding with God and doing something with him. He said he would just forget what he learned in Bible study because he never did anything with it! So Goff said about 15 years ago he started to get together with a group of guys each week and instead of calling it a Bible study they called it a Bible Doing. At his Bible Doing they read what God has to say and then focus all their attention on what they are going to do about it. He says if you get engaged like that you will be able to remember Bible verses because you are living them instead of just reading them. Amen to that! Dont get me wrong. Im all for Bible studies. They are critically important. But whats the point if we are not doing something about what the Bible says? I was convicted about this just this week as I was preparing this very sermon. I was in my study in the middle of what I thought was an important thought. And then my phone rang. It was an old friend of mine who is really struggling. And I thought, Ill call him back. Ill just finish this thought and call him back later. And then I sensed God saying to me, Charley, whats more important? Writing this sermon or being this sermon? So I stopped everything and picked up the phone and we had a great conversation that he said really helped him. Listening to my friend was ten times more important that finishing some point for a sermon. Bible doing instead of Bible studying. I like that! What if we called all of our Bible studies and Sunday school classes Bible doings instead of Bible studies? What if everyone one of our groups had a Bible doing component to it. What if every group was required to ask, Based on what we have learned this week what are we going to do about it? How are we going to show unusual kindness to the beaten, broken and bruised? How are we going to build a fire for those who are cold and tired? How are we going to be a source of light, warm and strength in a dark and cold world? In the end that is what matters. Ill tell you someone who gets this  Taylor Swift. Whether you like her music or you dont, this young lady is grounded in her faith and does not let the spotlight blind her to what is most important in life. She uses her celebrity and resources to build great big fires for those who are cold and hurt in the world. She sends gifts to fans, shows up at hospitals to play with fans who are sick, donates to schools, crashes parties, pays for dinners, writes letters and visits fans who are depressed. "
August-2-2015-sermon,"When I or some other pastor brings a legal pad into the office to discuss your funeral with your family what will they say about you? What will really matter to them? Have you ever thought about that? What will matter to them will be how well you loved. Our lives will be measured by how well we loved. Love never fails! Everything else will cease. Everything else will be stilled. Everything else will pass away. These three remain: faith, hope and love and the greatest of these is love. Years ago a John Hopkin's professor gave a group of graduate students this assignment: Go to the slums. Take 200 boys, between the ages of 12 and 16, and investigate their background and environment. Then predict their chances for the future. The students, after consulting social statistics, talking to the boys, and compiling much data, concluded that 90 percent of the boys would spend some time in jail. Twenty-five years later another group of graduate students was given the job of testing the prediction. They went back to the same area. Some of the boys -by then men -were still there, a few had died, some had moved away, but they got in touch with 180 of the original 200. They found that only four of the group had ever been sent to jail. Why was it that these men, who had lived in a breeding place of crime, had such a surprisingly good record? The researchers were continually told: ""Well, there was a teacher..."" They pressed further, and found that in 75 percent of the cases it was the same woman. The researchers went to this teacher, now living in a home for retired teachers. How had she exerted this remarkable influence over that group of children? Could she give them any reason why these boys should have remembered her? ""No,"" she said, ""no I really couldn't."" And then, thinking back over the years, she said musingly, more to herself than to her questioners: ""I loved those boys...."" (Bits and Pieces). God will measure our lives by how well we loved. So I have a challenge for you this week. I challenge each of you to do five acts of love this week. And I mean acts of sacrificial love, sacrificing time or something in your life for another. Can you do that? Do the math. This time of the year about 800 people will hear or read this message. At the end of the week this church will have done 4,000 acts of love in the name of Christ. Wow! We are called to be Gods agents of love in this world. That many acts of love will change lives. Christ showed us by his act of love on the cross that agape love is what changes lives. This is why we celebrate Communion on a regular basis, to remind us Jesus ultimate act of sacrificial love for us that redeemed us and for us to remember that it is our own expression of sacrificial love in the world that heals, changes and transforms. Amen. Pasadena Community Church How Will You Measure Your Life? By Who and How You Love Sunday, August 2, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today we begin a three week series entitled, How will you measure your life? Its pretty straight forward. The world tells us we should measure our lives by how much money we have, what cars we own, the achievements we have made, and the power and status we have attained. But, in the end, is this really how you want to measure your life? In the end is this really how you want to be remembered? This series is based on a great book by Clay Christiansen called How Will You Measure Your Life? Christensen is a Harvard Business professor who surprisingly tells his students that their lives should not be measured by their success and achievements in business. In the prologue of his book he explains why. Christiansen also went to Harvard and he explains his experience attending class reunions. He said at his fifth year reunion his fellow classmates seemed to be doing really well. They had high paying jobs and great marriages and families. They were polished and prosperous. Their lives seemed to be going well on every level. But by the tenth reunion he experienced something he never expected. Several of his successful classmates didnt come back for the reunion. As he asked other classmates where they were, he discovered that although many of his classmates achieved life changing success and were making enormous amounts of money they were not happy and did not enjoy their lives. Many of them had unhappy marriages and some were already divorced. One classmate had not spoken to his children for years. Christiansen observed that although many of his classmates were professionally successful they were personally miserable and their lives were a mess. Things just got worse. He said at his twenty -fifth and thirtieth year reunions he found out that one of his classmates, Jeffrey Skilling, was sent to prison for his role in the Enron scandal. Christiansen knew him in school as a good, smart man who loved his family and had good values. But over time something went drastically wrong in his life. Something had sent him in the wrong direction. But Skilling wasnt the only one. Many of his Rhodes Scholar classmates had also made a mess of their lives. One was arrested for insider training. Another ended up in jail for having a sexual relationship with a minor. Some of them were on their third and fourth marriages. Christiansen tells his students this story every year as a cautionary tale. Do not measure your life by success, money and achievement. Those things are great and they have their place but they will never bring real meaning and satisfaction to your lives. Maybe some of you feel like I am talking directly to you today. You have gotten the awards, success, money, notoriety, power, recognition, praise and glory. And yet you are still empty inside. There is a hole in you that cannot be filled. All the things you have done and achieved are really not how you want to measure your life. And you are in worship today because you know you need to change direction in your life. So how should we measure our lives? Well, the Bible is real clear about that. And in this series we are going to see how God wants us to measure our lives -By who and how we love, By what and how we give, By who and how we serve. We start with the most essential way God wants us to measure our lives  By whom and how ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org we love. Love is where our faith begins and ends. In the end our lives will be measured by how well we loved. But what exactly is love? How do we define it? Love is thrown around like a punch line in our culture. If you look up love in the dictionary you will find it is defined as having affection for someone or having romantic feelings. Well, the love God calls us to express is much deeper than that. There is no better place to understand this love than from one of the most known chapters in the entire Bible, 1st Corinthians 13. If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 3 If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of -1st these is love. Corinthians 13:1-8, 13 The word love Paul uses here is seen about 540 times in the Bible. In the Old Testament it is the word, hesed. In the New Testament it is agape. Agape is self-giving love, a sacrificial love, an unconditional love  a love that works in the best interest of others regardless of how we may feel about them  a love that sacrifices for others regardless of what they have done to us. It is the word used to describe the unconditional love of God. Agape is love in action. It is an action word. Thats why Paul chooses to define this love through action words. What does this love look like? It is patient. It is kind. It is selfless. It is humble. It is forgiving. It rejoices in the truth. It always protects, trusts, hopes, and perseveres. In other words, true Christian love is not something you talk about or think about; it is something you do! Love does. Agape love is also a decision. It is not based on feelings. Although right feelings often come after we express this love, agape love is choosing to love regardless of how you may feel. When that guy cuts you off, you choose to be patient and not give him a particular kind of wave. When the waitress gets your order wrong, you choose to be kind, loving, and tip them well, regardless. When you see the homeless man, you choose not be judgmental or critical but see him with the eyes of Christ and recognize his worth. When you see the old couple walking slowly down the cereal aisle you choose to be patient and kind. Perhaps they just came from the doctor and received a bad pathology report. These are the few precious moments they have together. When five oclock rolls around and you are tired and ready to go home, you stay a little longer to listen to a coworker who is upset. When people betray you, you choose not to retaliate but forgive because you know that is what Christ did for you. 1st John 4:16, 19-21 says, God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him.We love because he first loved us. If anyone says, I love God, yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. And he has given us this command: Whoever loves God must also love his brother. Let me tell you church: Agape love will change the world  not politics, not education, not money, not technology. Agape love, Christian love, the love of God revealed in Jesus Christ is what will heal this word. This love is the acid test of being a follower of Jesus. The central thrust of Jesus teaching and ministry was that sacrificial love wins and forgiving enemies overthrows evil. If we dont believe this we are just another charity organization. Lets face it. Every other group in society can do everything else Christians do. Christians have programs. So does every other group. We recite creeds. So do many other groups like Rotary and Kiwanis. Christians sing songs. So does every other group from the National Anthem to 99 bottles of beer on the wall! Christians raise money. So does every other group. So what makes us different? What makes us unique? What do we as Christ followers do that is different from a non-profit organization? We love unconditionally! We forgive our enemies? We love sacrificially! We do not return evil for evil but choose to do good when evil is done to us. We do what is best for another regardless of who they are or what they have done. We see others not as the world sees them but as children of God who have sacred worth. Harold Warlick once said, The greatness of our faith is our expansive loving spirit that overthrows resentments, takes in enemies, embraces rivals, and seeks the best for everyone. Lets bring this down to a personal level. On a general level agape love is fairly easy to take, but what about our personal relationships? Reverend James Moore recalls visiting a woman who was dying in a local hospital. She was in her mid-80's. Her son flew in to be with her. Moore was there when he arrived and entered the room. He walked over to the bedside of his dying mother, leaned over and kissed her on the cheek. He was so moved by her weak and vulnerable condition that he said to her: ""Mom, you have been such a good mother to me. And, I want you to know I love you."" The mother started to cry and through her tears she said: ""Son, that's the first time you've ever told me. Last Friday was your 63rd birthday and that's the first time you ever told me."" Moore comments by saying, Isn't that something? It took him 63 years to say I love you to his mother (A Mothers Love). Is there someone you need to express your love to today? Dont wait! Do it now! If your parents are still living, when was the last time you told them you love and appreciate them? When was the last time you told your spouse, family and friends that you love them? When was the last time you told your children how proud you are of them? When was the last time you loved someone by spending time with them. Are you estranged from a loved one? Forgive them as Christ has forgiven you. Life is too short and Christ calls us to take the first step because that is what he did for all of us. Your forgiving love will bring healing to you and perhaps healing to the one you are forgiving. Agape love is powerful and transforming. People who dont feel loved and nurtured dont get very far in life. Studies have been done on infants. When infants are not hugged and nurtured, they have a greater chance of developing handicaps and illnesses as they grow. Leo Buscalgia is a writer and speaker who goes around the world and talks about one important subject: love. He says that when he finishes speaking there is usually a long line of people waiting to see him. Buscalgia says that most of them are not waiting in line to talk to him, but to receive a hug. He says he comes across so many people who tell him that they have not been hugged or touched in years. They walk away from this encounter new people! When we know we are loved, we can do anything, conquer anything, overcome anything! The Apostle Paul said it best in Romans 8: We are more than conquerors through Christ who loves us. Love wins! The love of God always wins. This is the essence of our faith and what the gospels teach us over and over again. Jesus sums it up by telling us that the world will know we are Christians by our love  not by the way we worshipnot by our knowledge of the Biblenot by our sophisticated theologynot by our judgmentsnot by our denominationbut by our love for each other! In John 15 Jesus tells us that his purpose for us is that we bear much fruit. And what is that fruit supposed to be? My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down ones life for ones friends. John 15:12-13 Now, most of us are not going to be called to die for another but all of us are called to love sacrificially. And this doesnt mean just opening a door for someone. For most us it means sacrificing time  helping someone with a flat tire, baking cookies for a new neighbor, listening to someone when you would be rather be home watching television, throwing the ball with your kid when you would rather take a nap. In the end, those are the moments that count. Oh how we need to learn this lesson. I cant tell you how many people I have visited and how many people who have crossed the threshold of my office door who wished they had lived their lives motivated by love. They talk about the times spent arguing about trivial matters. They talk of the energy spent resenting. They talk about the money wasted on needless things and the time wasted on a ridiculous pursuit. They wish they had learned the importance of love earlier. I have done many funerals in my ministry. You know what I have never heard at a funeral? I have never heard anyone mention how much money the deceased person had in their bank account when they died. No one has ever mentioned how many houses or boats they owned, or their golf handicap. You know what has been mentioned? The love they shared with others  the laughter and joy they shared with family and friends  the transforming moments. "
August-23-2015-sermon,"confessed that he did not know her husband. She replied, I thought so. I didnt recognize you. But it doesnt really matter. Then she squeezed his arm so hard it hurt and said, Youll never, ever know, what this means to me. When I talked with people about those who have helped them the most, they never name a philosopher. You know who they usually name? A quiet, unassuming person who was there whenever needed. Someone who listened more than talked. Someone who didnt keep looking down at a watch, but instead hugged, touched and cried. Someone who was available. There are a lot of lonely and hurting people out there. Take a risk and reach out to them. You never know the difference it might make. Well, Felicia, Caitlyn and Amanda taught me a lot. But you know what? Watching the customers at Caddys over the years has also taught me a lot. You have people from all walks of life, all backgrounds, all socio-economic levels playing together, laughing together, eating and drinking together. You have Asian people, black people, white people, all people, having a good time together. It is really a picture of what the Kingdom of God is going to be like  a big party with all kinds of people from all over the world playing together and praising God. Caddys reminds me that God is happiest when his children are at play. G.K. Chesterton said that God is the last child left in the universe. He said the rest of us have just lost our joy. I have thought a lot about those words and I believe Chesterton was on to something. When we read Genesis we see that joy radiated through God as He created the universe. When God created you and me, there was great joy in His heart. This is why when C.S. Lewis was asked the question, What is the greatest theological discovery you ever made he replied, I exist to enjoy Gods enjoyment of me. Did you hear that? God enjoys you! God wants you to enjoy him, to enjoy life, to enjoy the world he has created, and to enjoy the people he has put in your life. Do you know what Jesus first miracle was in John? It occurred in a small town called Cana at a wedding party. Now, a wedding party back then could go on for an entire week! Jesus was invited to this party. So, I want you to appreciate this. One of the first scenes of Jesus in John is not him teaching in the plains or holding a sick persons hand; it is Jesus at a party! Well, after a few days they ran out of wine. What do you think Jesus did? Help clean up and say goodnight? No! He told some folks to fill several large jars with water and he performed his first miracle by turning all that water into wine. So, Jesus first miracle in John was not healing the sick, feeding the hungry, walking on water, or raising the dead. His first miracle was making 180 gallons of wine so a party could continue! Now dont freak out. This doesnt mean that Jesus gives us permission to go out and get drunk, crazy and careless. The point of the story is not alcohol. It is about extravagant joy  God came to us in Jesus so we would have joy and our joy would be full. You can read the story of Jesus turning the water into wine over and over again. You can send it to scholars and theologians trying to find some great theological point, but you will never find it. The great truth of that story is this: sometimes Jesus did things for fun! Jesus was showing us how to get our joy back and for our joy to be full. So go out to Caddys today! Its beautiful at Sunset. Ask for Amanda, Felicia or Caitlyn. Enjoy Gods enjoyment of you. Make a new friend. Play. Enjoy the life God has given you! Enjoy the burgers. They are the best in town, believe me. I have had many of them! And to get you in the mood for Caddys I have brought something that might help. Lets see how long you can keep these beach balls in the air! I bet this is the first time this is has happened in this sanctuary! God is happiest when his children are at play. Pasadena Community Church What I Learned at Caddys on the Beach Sunday, August 23, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Well as you can see I am preaching a unique message today. I want to talk to you about what I have learned going to my favorite restaurant and hangout  Caddys on the Beach. I have received a variety of responses to the prospect of todays sermon. Some have said, Thats cool! I love that place! Others have said, This should be interesting. I wonder what you are going to say about that. And then, of course, I have heard, Why would you preach about a bar and grille on the beach? Its a fair question. The truth is there are a few reasons why I am preaching this message and I will talk about them throughout this message today. But right off the bat I want to say that a big reason why I am preaching this message is that Christians and churches need to re-imagine and rethink how we engage the community and world. Church is not what we do one hour a week in this facility or the Bible study or the Sunday school class we attend. Those things are great and they nourish us but that is not when or how church happens. Church is what you and I do every day with our lives to reflect the love of Jesus Christ. The church is not a building or a worship service. It is us! We are the body of Christ. So church happens at the grocery store, during a play date, on the golf course, at a neighborhood birthday party and, yes, at our favorite restaurant! The spirit of Christ is certainly with us as we worship and study the Bible but the spirit of Christ is also out in our community around everyday people. And Christ calls us to join him in giving people hope and helping them to realize how much God loves them. In order to do that we have to take a good look at how we engage people in our everyday lives. We have to be mindful of our attitudes and behaviors when we give a server our order or we pick up our dry cleaning or when we interact with other parents at a soccer game. Gods love doesnt wait on people. It lovingly pursues people and meets them where they are and where they live. And if we believe the love of God is in our hearts that love is going to pull us to lovingly engage people in the everyday world. Gone are the days when people assume faith and the church are relevant to them. For various reasons, many people in our culture have an aversion to faith and church. If we are going to ever convince them that Gods love is real and can change their lives we must be willing to connect with people on their turf and engage them, understand them, respect them, love them and have fun with them. People need to see that we as Christ followers are real, human, and have the same struggles as everyone else. They need to see that we dont think we are better than anyone else. We simply believe we were created by love for love. We rely on Gods love and power to help us and we believe that Gods love can make people whole. If people can begin to see Gods love in us then we can start making a difference. But in order to do that we cant just show up on Sunday and hope other people will wake up and say, Maybe I will go to church. Thats not going to cut it. We have to take Gods love with us into the world, to places like Caddys on the Beach. You know who gave us the best example of this? Jesus Christ. If Jesus did ministry in our context today he wouldnt be hanging out in churches; he would be going to places like Caddys on the Beach. The Bible tells us so. The religious leaders were surprised at the places Jesus went and the people he hung out with. Take a look at what Jesus said to some religious leaders: The Son of Man, on the other hand, feasts and drinks, and you say, 'He's a glutton and a ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!' Luke 7:34 Basically, they accused Jesus of being a party animal! They thought Jesus was having too much of a good time. They thought God was not into fun, games, and play but Jesus proved them wrong. Jesus was filled with the love and joy of God and he wanted everyone to experience it. There was no place he would not go or person he would not hang out with in order to share Gods love. So inspired by the witness of Christ, I want to tell you what I have learned by going to a fun hang out in this community. I want to tell you my observations as I have enjoyed myself at Caddys over the last several years. For those of you who dont know about Caddys on the Beach, it is a beach bar and grille located on Sunset Beach in Treasure Island. The reason it is called Caddys is that if you wish, a caddy will set out chairs and umbrellas for you on the beach and serve food and drinks as you bask in the sun. Of course, you can sit on picnic tables or you can sit inside the restaurant and listen to live music and dance as you enjoy great food. They also have a top deck above the restaurant where you can hang out and get a great view of the sunset. Its a very laid back and friendly atmosphere. And the staff is a big part of that. And that leads me to what I want to share first about what I learned at Caddys. This week I went out to Caddys for sermon research! I know. Its a tough job. The lengths I will go to serve you and the sacrifices I will make for sermons is remarkable, isnt it? While I inhaled a delicious cheeseburger I had conversations with three employees I have connected with in prior trips to Caddys. Here is picture of them. The one on the very left is Felicia. She has worked at Caddys for six years. Next to Felicia, in the middle, is Felicias sister Caitlyn. She has worked at Caddys for five years. Both of them are servers. And on the very right is Amanda. Amandas dad used to own Caddys and she told me that his vision was that Caddys be a fun family friendly place to eat and enjoy the beach. Amanda has been a bartender at Caddys for over 12 years. All three of them told me that most employees have been working at Caddys for many years with very little turn over. They are one big family and they have one anothers back. I casually interviewed all three of them about Caddys and their experience working there. I asked them what their experience at Caddys has taught them about life and people. Felicia turned away from the register and said, Everyone should work in the service industry for a week. When I asked her why, she said, Most people have no idea what we go through serving people. I said, Yeah, I have often said that you can tell a lot about people by how they treat the people who serve them. She said, That is so true! Some people are very nice and polite but some people treat us like slaves. We are not robots. We are people. Treat us like people. We are happy to serve you but treat us with respect. It is true. You can tell a lot about people by how they treat those who serve them. You want to get to know people? Take them out to eat and watch how they interact with the servers. You will find out all you need to know. I think Felicias advice is great. We should experience working in the service industry and consider what it is like to serve others. More than that, we ought to be serving others on a regular basis. After all, Jesus called us to serve. He sat down and washed the disciples feet and told them to do the same for one another. He said the greatest in the kingdom are those who serve. So you could say that waiters and waitresses are celebrities in the kingdom of God. We, as Christians, should know this better than anyone else! So next time you are in a restaurant call your server by name. Be kind. Get to know them. And tip them well! Christians ought to be known for their generosity, not by their cheapness! I turned to Amanda and asked, Well, being a bartender for 12 years at a place like Caddys must have taught you a lot about people. What have you learned? She didnt hesitate. She said, Never judge a book by its cover. I said, Tell me more. She replied, Well, the truth is there is something about people being in their bathing suits at a bar that causes their true selves to come out. Millionaires and celebrities have sat at my bar. Rays players and other famous athletes have sat at my bar. And, you know, people will tell a bartender everything. We are like counselors. I get to see the real people behind the titles, prestige, money, judgments and assumptions. Amanda told me that some people you think would be really nice and have it all together have the most miserable lives. And some people who have the reputation of being mean and hateful are very generous people who are misunderstood. Some of the wealthiest people have been the worst tippers and some of the most financially humble people have been the biggest tippers. Amanda said, I have learned not to make assumptions about anyone. Dont be so quick to judge. People will surprise you. Amanda gives great advice. How often are we quick to judge people? We see people dressed in a certain way or look a certain way and we stereotype them or put them in a category. We make assumptions about their character. We are all guilty of it at one level or another. I remember being in Austin, Texas many years ago. It over the New Years holiday and I was there to spend a week with an old college buddy of mine. The first place he took me to was La Lona Rosa in downtown Austin. It was a bar and concert venue. He knew I loved the blues and especially Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble. Well, this was after Stevie Ray had passed away. However Double Trouble was still very much alive and they were playing that night at La Lona Rosa with an up and coming blues guitarist! I was thrilled! We were standing around talking, waiting for the opening band to come out and along came this really tall and skinny guy. He was all alone with a drink in his hand. He came up to me and asked me where we were from. I told him and I asked where he was from and we started a conversation. He was a nice guy. Very soft spoken. Well, the opening band came out and played and he kept talking to us to about music. I thought to myself, Hope this guy is not going to do this all night, especially when Double Trouble gets on stage! The opening band finished and this guy looked at his watch and said, Well, it was really nice meeting you guys. Im here a lot when Im not in town. Maybe Ill see you out here again. I gotta go! I said, You go to go? You will miss Double Trouble! He said, Well, I am half of the double in trouble. Thats why I have to go. We are up to play next. Im Tommy Shannon, the bassist for Double Trouble. I replied, You mean to tell me I have been talking to Stevie Ray Vaughans wingman for the last 30 minutes? Why didnt you tell me? He said, Well, you never asked! I made the assumption that celebrities arent that nice. They dont just walk around and talk to average people like me. I was wrong. Never judge a book by its cover. The Bible talks about this in 1st Samuel. The Lord is talking to Samuel about seeking the next King of Israel. He sends him to Jesse because the Lord has chosen one of his sons to be King. Samuel went and he looked upon Eliab who was big and strong and he assumed that he was the one the Lord had chosen to be King. But look at what God says to Samuel in 1st Samuel 16:7: But the LORD said to Samuel, Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the LORD does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart. Then God called David, the youngest one of the bunch, and Samuel anointed him King. David was very young and was taking care of the sheep. He seemed to be the last one qualified to be King. Yet God saw his heart and what he could become. Thats who God is. He sees more than what others see. God looks at our hearts. He sees what we can be. Therefore we should never judge a book by its cover. God doesnt do that to us, thankfully. We should not do that to others. Caitlyn added to the conversation and said, There are a lot of lonely and hurting people who come here. They come here because it is a fun place with lots of people and music and it makes them feel better. Caitlyn said that she knows people who will come in and buy drinks for a bunch of people they dont know because they just want friendly people to hang out with and they think if they buy drinks for strangers they can buy friends for the evening. Caitlyns right. There are a lot of lonely and hurting people in the world who just want to be listened to and loved. I mentioned a couple of weeks ago that we live in what sociologists call the Age of the Lonely Crowd. It is true. There are many people in the midst of a great crowd who are lonely and hurting. They are in restaurants, in shopping malls, at school, and in the house next door to you. Jesus said. I want to you to love one another as I have loved you. You want to know the truth. It is not our words or insights that lonely and hurting people want most. It is simply our presence. I learn this over and over again as a minister. Most of the time people arent looking for words or insights from me, as if I had that much to offer. Most of the time people simply want my presence. Tony Campolo tells the story of going to a funeral to pay his respects to the family of acquaintance of his. By mistake he ended up in the wrong parlor. It held the body of an elderly man and his widow was the only person present. She seemed so lonely that Campolo decided to stay for the funeral. He even drove with her to the cemetery. At the end of the graveside service as he and the woman were driving away, Campolo finally "
August-9-2015-sermon,"Whitesnake concert. Well, especially at a Whitesnake concert! Now for those of you who are appalled that I, your pastor, went to a Whitesnake concert, I have news for you: Guess who Jesus hung out with! If Jesus came back today he wouldnt come to church he would go to a Whitesnake concert! And I believe he would enjoy it! Tony Campolo tells the story of one of his deacons who was depressed. Campolo told him that if he would go out and help others he would feel better. So, the deacon went to a nursing home and got to know a man. He went to see him every week and would hold his hand during a chapel service. One day the deacon arrived at the nursing home to find his new friend not in his usual spot. He checked with a nurse, and she informed him that he had taken a turn for the worse. The deacon went into the hospital room, and all the tubes were hooked up to his body. The deacon picked up the mans hand and prayed that God would receive his friend into his everlasting arms. The man squeezed the deacons hand and opened his eyes. The deacon knew he had connected with him. The next day the deacon went to check on his friend, and he discovered that he died shortly after he had left the day before. But he met a middle-aged woman while he was there, and he found out that she was his friends daughter. She said, Thank you! Thank you! You did so much for my dad. Because of you he died in peace. Deacon asked, What do you mean? She replied, He told me that every week Jesus would come by and hold his hand and he did not want to die until he held the hand of Jesus one more time. I dont know what you think being a Christian is, but I believe it is being the hands of Christ in this world. It is being the arms of Christ in this world. It is being the feet of Christ in this world. It is being the heart of Christ in this world. Paul Tournier once said, Every Christian needs two conversions  one out of the world, and one back into it. I believe that. The Christian faith is not just about personal piety, reaching up to God and reaching in to ourselves. The Christian faith is only complete when our reaching up and reaching in leads us to reach out to others. Have you ever asked, Someone should do something about this? Well, could it be that someone is you? God wants to do extraordinary things in this world but He needs the resources He has given you to do it! Dont hold back. Sources: -Clay Christiansen, How Will You Measure Your Life? -Mike Slaughter, Putting God First in Living and Giving -Martin Thielin, Whats The Least I Can Believe and Still Be a Christian? -Tony Campolo, Let Me Tell You a Story Pasadena Community Church How Will You Measure Your Life? By How and What You Give Sunday, August 9, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today we continue our three part series entitled, How will you measure your life? Its pretty straight forward. The world tells us we should measure our lives by how much money we have, what cars we own, the achievements we have made, and the power and status we have attained. But, in the end, is this really how we should measure our lives? In the end is this really how we want to be remembered? This series is based on a great book by Clay Christiansen called How Will You Measure Your Life? Christensen is a Harvard Business professor who surprisingly tells his students that their lives should not be measured by their success and achievements in business. In the prologue of his book he explains why he gives his students this advice. Christians explains that as a Harvard alumnus he has learned through attending many class reunions and observing many of his classmates that success does not bring true happiness and meaning. Although many of his classmates have high paying jobs and are at the pinnacle of success they are personally miserable and their lives are a mess. So Christiansen warns his students not to make success the source of their happiness because it will never bring contentment and meaning to their lives. So what will bring contentment and meaning to our lives? How should we measure our lives? Well, the Bible is real clear about that. And in this series we are going to see how God wants us to measure our lives who and how we love, By what and how we give, By who and how we serve. Today our focus is giving. God will measure our lives not by how much we get but by how much we give. Jesus told us that it is better to give than to receive (Acts 20:35). He also said, Whoever loses their life, gives their live away for my sake will save it, will find life, but whoever holds on to their life for themselves, will lose life, will never find life (Luke 9:24). Its clear. Jesus tells us that God measures each of our lives by how much of it we are willing to give away for him. Now why? Well, first because living a life of giving is the only way to find meaning and happiness in this world. If you are looking for fun, joy, meaning and satisfaction, give your life away in service to Christ. The happiest people I know are the most generous people I know. And the most miserable people I know are the stingiest people I know. Throughout my ministry I have learned with few exceptions that the ones who complain the most in the church give the least to the church and the ones who are the most joyous give the most. But the other and even more important reason why God measure our lives by how much we are willing to give away is this: When God wants something done in this world he counts on us to do it! Thats right. We are Gods agents in the world. Take a look at this passage that spells it out: God can pour on the blessings in astonishing ways so that youre ready for anything and everything, more than just ready to do what needs to be done. He gives you something you can then give away, which grows into full-formed lives, robust in God, wealthy in every way, so that you can be generous in every way, producing with us great praise to God. -2nd Corinthians 9:8 and 11 Did you see that? God gives you (us) something we can give away, and as we give it away the more we get back so that we can continue to be generous! You know what this means? We are to be the channel through which Gods blessings and redemptive power flows to the world! As we receive blessings from God, we are to give those blessings away. Our talents, gifts and resources are what God will use to carry out his redemptive work in the world! So, God is TRYING to meet the needs of others and heal the pain in this world, but God can only give as much as we are willing to give away. We are His vessels! When God wants something done he counts on us to do it! You want to know something that will blow your mind? There is only one incident in the Bible ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org where God meets the needs of others WITHOUT using his people  God providing manna to the Israelites in the desert. Note that the manna stopped once the people reached the Promised Land. Every other time God wanted to help others he did it through his people. We are the hands and feet of Jesus in the world! We are the body of Christ in this world! What do we think that means? When the people of God do not give financially to the church something God wants done does not get done. It is as simple as that. We are the only bank account God has. There is no other way for God to meet the needs of people except through us. When the people of God are not faithful to their vows to serve with their gifts, something God wants done does not get done. We are the only hands God has! When the people of God are silent when injustices occur across this world, something God wants done does not get done. We are the only voice God has! When we ask God, Why arent you doing anything about all of this suffering? Gods response is, I am and I have. I have given my people all the resources they need to change and heal this world. I will never stop giving blessings so you can be a blessing, so why arent you doing anything about it? Mike Slaughter reminds us that Gods blessing and our giving are interconnected in our lives. They go hand in hand. That is how God made us. That is how God made this world to work. We are blessed, we give blessings away, and God multiplies our blessings so we can give even more away. The more we give the more God gives for us to give away! Look at the story of Jesus feeding five thousand families in the wilderness in Mark 6. That was Jesus great demonstration that God releases his resources through his people! A big crowd was hungry. Jesus told the disciples to feed them. The disciples said, What? We cant do that? Do you know how much money that would cost? Well, Jesus didnt accept their excuse of what they didnt have and he doesnt accept that excuse from us today. Jesus said, How many loaves do you have? Slaughter interprets Jesus question to mean Dont look at what you dont have, look at what you do have! Look at what God has given you to give away. The disciples found five loaves and two fish. Jesus told the disciples to seat the people on the grass and tell them to get ready for a feast. The disciples thought Jesus had lost his mind. Jesus blessed the bread and fish and fed five thousand families with it. You see, God blessed and multiplied what they had to give away. The disciples had enough faith in Jesus to give him what they had and he multiplied it! Thats what God always does  when we give Him what we have He multiplies it so that there is more than we could ever imagine. In the story, after everyone is fed, there is such an abundance that there is more left over! You know what is also important in that story is that Jesus didnt serve the crowd; he gave the disciples the food to serve the crowd. They were his hands then and we are his hands today. And if a church forgets this it begins to die. The effectiveness of a church rises and falls based on its willingness to be the hands and feet of Christ in this world. The problem is that many Christians have bought into the unbiblical notion that faith is personal but not public. It is one of the deadliest heresies to face the church in 2,000 years! If you look at many of the churches in America today they only emphasize personal faith and ignore public faith. They want people to affirm their faith in Christ, which is in important. And they want people to have good morals, which is very important. But they seem to completely ignore the biblical mandate to care about social issues like poverty, peacemaking and the environment. In short, there is a hole in our gospel and it is the biblical mandate to join Jesus in the world and help him free the oppressed and bring justice to his children  to do something about human trafficking, genocide, to do something and poverty  to do something about the children who die of starvation every day. Martin Thielen reminds us that when many of the churches in America address social issues they limit their involvement to only two issues: abortion and homosexuality. Thats it. Now, there is no doubt those are two very important issues, but they dont begin to cover all the social issues that God cares about! If you read the Bible, and I mean really read the Bible, it is abundantly clear that God deeply cares about poverty, the environment, race relations, peacemaking, health care, immigration, taxes, debt relief, just court systems, fair wages, prisons, and hunger. Thielen writes, Since these issues matter to God, they should also matter to Gods church. You want to know what young people care about today? They care about social justice issues. When they dont see the church caring about these issues, they write the church off. Why should they care about the church when they see that the church doesnt care about the important issues they care about? You want to know how the church is going to reach the next generation and be a relevant force in the future? By being faithful to Jesus call to care about social justice. When we take social justice issues seriously the world will take us seriously. Of course when I named all of these issues, what did you think about? It wasnt the church. It was politics! And that is our problem. These issues have become so politically charged that the church just runs away from them. And evil loves that! Here is the truth and you can take it to the bank. All political parties are equally sinful. Jesus is not a Democrat, a Republican, or an Independent. And Jesus is certainly not an American! You know who Jesus is? He is the Savior of the World! Jesus does not want the church dividing and corrupting itself in politics. You know what Jesus wants! Jesus wants us to join him in the world and help him let the oppressed go free! I want to be very clear about something. God cares deeply about personal faith. God cares about our personal salvation and being in a relationship with him. God cares about our moral behavior and being pure. God cares about evangelism and making disciples. That Bible is clear about that. And I am passionate about these things too. If you have heard me preach for any length of time you know these are important issues to me. But a healthy biblical faith is personal and public. You cant have one without the other! As Jim Wallis reminds us, Faith is personal but never private! The closer you get to Christ the more he draws you into the community and world for you to see the suffering that he sees and inspires you help him! Jesus is out in the world begging us to help him lift up the weak. The prophet Micah declares, What does the Lord require of you? To do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God! Jesus says an astonishing thing in John 14. Take a look. Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. John 14:12 Wow! What a verse! How is that possible? Let me explain. Christ has always existed. The first chapter of John explains this fact. But when Christ was in bodily form in Jesus, he was limited. He could only touch and love one person or one group at a time. However, when Christ went back to the Father, his Spirit was able to infuse each of his followers. This means that his ability to love is multiplied, and Christ is able to reach millions of people through us. We are literally the body of Christ reaching out to the world! And Jesus is chomping at the bit inside of us to reach out and love and change others. The opportunities are all around us. We just have to open our eyes. My colleague told me about a minister who likes to go to Nordstroms department store at Christmas. Her name is Claire. She really does not buy anything. She just fills a Nordstroms' bag with paper and walks around enjoying music, lights and other sights and sounds of Christmas. One year she was on the top floor where womens clothing was located. An elevator opened and a bag lady appeared. She was caked in dirt. She had a shopping bag in her hand that contained all of her belongings. Claire noticed a nice saleswoman approach the lady and ask, Can I help you? The bag lady replied, Im looking for a cocktail dress. Well, it was obvious to Claire that the lady could never afford a cocktail dress. But the saleswoman continued to be gracious and said, Oh, we have a great selection! She found three dresses for her, the cheapest being around $3,000, and then led her to the dressing room. Claire was really intrigued by all of this, and so she moved closer in order eavesdrops on them. A few minutes later the bag lady came out of the dressing room and said, Ive changed my mind. I am not going to buy anything. Saleswoman replied Oh, thats okay. If you are ever in Nordstroms again, heres my card. It would be a pleasure to wait on you again. Claire could not believe the attitude of the saleswoman. So, after the bag lady had walked away, she approached the saleswoman, intending to find out exactly what had gotten in to this saleslady. Before Claire could open her mouth, she found her answer. On the saleswomans blouse was a pin with the letters WWJD  What Would Jesus Do? In Romans 8 we are told that the same Spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwells in us! It is Christ who is alive in us, and he wants to love and connect with others through us. The world needs this so bad! We live in an age that sociologists call, The age of the lonely crowd. This means that we are with each other but we dont connect with each other. We e-mail and text each other, but we dont connect with each other. When was the last time you really connected with someone? When was the last time you treated someone as a child of God and connected with them? They are a lot of lonely people out there. This issue came into focus for me this week as I attended a very uplifting concert at Ruth Eckerd Hall. It was a Whitesnake concert. I just love the arts! For those of you who dont know, Whitesnake is a hard rock band that was very popular in the 80s and early 90s. And, like many hard rock bands of that era, they have gained a second life touring around the country reminding folks of my generation how much fun their music was and is. If you look up the band and listen to their music many of you may not like it, but I admit I am a fan of hard rock. Well, Brandy and I arrived at the concert and when we arrived at our seats we found a young man, about 20 years old, sitting by himself. He greeted us like he had known us for years! Hey! Arent these seats awesome? Im so excited! This is going to be great! I wonder what song they are going to sing first. And this kid would not stop talking! He told me he came to the concert alone because he couldnt find anyone to come with him. He said his parents didnt want to go. I said, They dont like Whitesnake? Well, its their loss, right? Well, the entire concert the kid kept hitting my shoulder in excitement and yelling, This is awesome! Have you ever seen anything like this? Wow! How cool! Look at that! Look at that! I still cant hear anything! I must admit that the experience touched me. It reminded how lonely people are. The kid just wanted someone to connect with him. I am sure he was hoping someone would sit next to him and share his excitement. And I did! We had a ball! There are a lot of lonely people out there and Jesus is dying to connect with them through us, even at a "

We are taking a look at the real meaning of Christmas through some of our favorite Christmas movies. Many of us watch these movies over and over again every year because they inspire us. And when we look closer at these movies we find the real meaning of Christmas  which is the love that Christ comes to bring us. I actually conclude this series on Christmas Eve at the 11:00pm service with the movie A Christmas Carol. So join us for that! But today we are going to be taking a look at the movie Elf. Now I know many of you have been looking forward to us looking at the movie on Sunday morning. And some of you have just been strangely curious about it. Really? He is really going to preach on that! What is he going to say? Well, you are about to find out! Now how many of you have seen Elf? Believe it or not there is a powerful message in this movie. Let me give you the back story of it. The movie begins with a baby in an orphanage on Christmas Eve. Santa visits the orphanage to bring gifts and begins to eat the cookies and milk left for him. As Santa is enjoying the cookies the little baby crawls out of his crib and into Santas toy sack. Santa returns to the North Pole and celebrates with his elves on how successful Christmas was. As Santa is celebrating with the elves, lo and behold, something comes out of his toy sack! And it is this baby! Santa and the elves end up adopting the baby and name him Buddy because that is the brand of pampers he is wearing! Buddy grows up with the elves doing elf like duties, making toys and shoes and cookies. He is much bigger than the other elves and not as astute at elf like duties. One day he finds out he is not an elf. He is human and he goes on a quest to find his real dad. This is how the movie begins. Now, I thought a lot about how to organize this message today. And, truthfully, the outline of todays message is contained in the movie itself. It is the Code of Ethics for the Elves. Let me show you the clip where Buddy and the elves learn their code of ethics: (Show code of ethics clip) Treat everyday like Christmas; There is room for everyone on the nice list; The best way to spread holiday cheer is to sing loud for all to hear. Believe it or not there are solid spiritual truths behind these Elf Code of Ethics. We are going to take a close look at each of them today. I want to begin with the second rule first: There is room for everyone on the nice list. This is where the movie really begins. Buddys real dad is on the naughty list. He is a burned out publisher of childrens books working in New York City. He is mean, insensitive and selfish. He is numb to life. But buddy makes a trip from the North Pole to New York City to find his dad. Buddy pursues his dad who is on the naughty list because he loves him and believes there is room for him on the nice list. So he makes the long journey and finds his dad working in the Empire State Building. I know someone who pursues us and will not stop until he finds us. I know someone who loves us no matter how bad we are and always makes room for us. His name is Jesus. Jesus pursues each one of us. In fact, a poet once called Christ The Hound of Heaven because he is relentless in his passionate pursuit of each of us. It doesnt matter what we have done, he loves and pursues us and wants to live in our hearts. That is what we celebrate at Christmas. Love came down at Christmas. Thats right, God in Christ made the loving choice to pursue us so we would know how much he loves us and surrender to that love. Jesus said, I came to seek and save the lost. He came to seek those of us on the naughty list and those of us on the lonely list or the broken dream list or the discouraged list or the cynical list. He came to seek us and save us and love us and make us whole. I dont know what list you are on today. But I know Jesus can find you and love you and make you whole. There is always room for anyone on the nice list. The love of Christ can transform anyone. Whoever you are, whatever you have done, open your heart to that love and Christ will transform you. And when you do that you discover the profound and powerful significance of the second rule of the elves: Treat every day like Christmas. And that means to engage life the way God intended for us to engage it  to live our lives with wonder, love, joy, and creativity  to treat every day as a gift from God because it is! The best illustration of this is Buddy himself in the movie! Now he treats every day like Christmas. I want to show you a clip that captures it well. This next clip shows Buddy experiencing New York City and the world outside the North Pole for the first time. Take a look: (Show clip of Buddy in New York City) Now Buddy knows how to enjoy life and treat every day like Christmas! His behavior reminds me of a story about a group of theologians and scholars who once cornered C.S. Lewis and asked him, What is the most important theological discovery you have ever made? Lewis smiled and responded, I exist to enjoy Gods enjoyment of me. Did you know that God enjoys you! God wants you to enjoy him, to enjoy life, to enjoy the world he has created, and to enjoy the people he has put in your life. He wants you to live every day like Christmas! Scripture backs up Gods call to enjoy life in 1st Timothy 6:17: Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. You want to know one of the first things the ancient church taught those who were converting to Christianity? It is known as the Short Catechism and here it is: What is the chief end of humankind? To glorify God and enjoy Him forever! I come across so many people who wont allow God into their lives because they think God is going to make them give up fun. Many misguided Christians have perpetuated this nonsense. They give off the impression that to become a Christian means the party is over  that being spiritual means being miserable. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, to become a Christian means the party is just beginning. We begin to see what joy really is! After all, God is the one who created fun! God created us to play and to enjoy the life he created! The Bible tells us so. In the tenth chapter of Mark we read that Jesus was teaching and a bunch of playful kids ran toward him. The sour disciples were appalled. You can imagine their reaction, Children ought to be seen and not heard. Where are their parents? Cant they see these kids are interrupting Jesus? Get these kids out of here! The Bible says that Jesus became very angry at the disciples. He felt the kids were treated unfairly. He said, What are you doing? Let the children come to me. Dont get in their way. In fact, unless you can receive the Kingdom like these kids, you will never be able to enter it. What did Jesus mean by this bold statement? Children are receptive, dependant and trusting. They bring nothing but themselves and their joy. Jesus said that unless we are able to receive God and his Kingdom like that we will never understand God and his Kingdom. G.K. Chesterton wrote something that I have never been able to forget. He wrote that God is the last child left in the universe. He said the rest of us have just lost our joy. I think he was right. I dont know what you think about God but one of his biggest qualities is joyfulness. Imagine how much fun he had creating this world! You see, we forget this. We forget that we were created from joy to be joyful. This next clip reveals that. (Show clip of Buddy smiling) So often this is what we become. We become like that manager. We lose our joy. We forget how to play and have fun. Life gets busy. We make work more important. Our priorities get out of whack and we forget that in working so hard to make a living we have forgotten that God want us to live! Has work become your favorite? Has busyness and getting ahead and being successful become your favorite? Have you forgotten to enjoy the life God has given you? Have you forgotten to live life with wonder, playfulness, and creativity  those qualities that God gave you, that you knew as a child, but you have become numb to them over time. When was the last time you just smiled at someone? When was the last time you were so engaged joyfully with life that you forgot to check your cell phone or the time? I was at the hockey game the other night. I love cheering on the Lightning. Those games are so much fun! Well, I was able to sit right behind the boards! Right behind the glass! Thats the way to watch a hockey game! And, of course, when they fight I look down and say, Thats terrible! Thats terrible! No, Come on!!!! Is that the pastor down there? I got to know the family sitting next to me. It was a mother and father and their two teenage daughters. We were having a good time joking around and screaming for the Lightning. Then there came a moment when the players were tussling against the boards, right in front of us! It was awesome. But the guy next to me elbowed me and pointed at his daughters. What were they doing? They were texting on their cell phones, deeply immersed in a conversation! Right behind the glass in the middle of a hockey game! Isnt that an illustration of how life gets sometimes? There is this great big world all around us that God has created and so often we get stuck by being preoccupied with trivial things. We forget to open our eyes and ears to Gods blessings all around us! There is reason why we call it recreation. RE  Creation  when we stop to enjoy the life God has given us it is life giving  we are recreating ourselves! And when we dont take time to recreate ourselves we can become miserable, grumpy, mean, and bitter. We can get lost in our trivial pursuits that take our life away. Maybe your stress has sucked the life, love and joy right out of you. It is time to let yourself be loved by God and enjoy life. I think of it this way. When I was a little boy and would get grumpy and grouchy, my dad had a clever way of changing my mood. He would not lecture me. He wouldnt tell me that I should be grateful for what I had and not complain. He would get on the floor with me and find a place just above my belly button and blow air bubbles on my tummy. He would do it until I smiled and gave into laughter. Quite simply, this is what God did for us in Jesus. God got down on our level and embraced us so that we might get joy back in our lives. You have homework to do. Go out and let yourself be loved. Go hack at a golf ball. Take dance lessons and learn how to dance. Turn on your favorite song and sing like no one is listening. Go watch your favorite comedy and laugh your way to joy! We have all seen the bumper sticker that says Wag more, Bark less. Well, todays message is simple: Elf More, Grinch Less. You know the biggest regret people have when they die is not that they wish they had made more money, were more successful, powerful or famous. Their regret is about something they did not do  pursuing a dream, a hobby, or a relationship. What would you say if you had to finish this sentence: If I had to live my life over, I would...? Dont wait! Treat every day like Christmas. This leads right in to the third rule for elves: The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear. When we experiencing the love of Christ and live life each day with love and joy and gratitude, we come to see how important our witness is to the rest of the world. I dont need to tell you that so many people live in darkness and they desperately need the light of Christ to shine through us. Jesus said, Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven (Matthew 5:15-16). John 1:5 says, The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. We are to let our light shine. God has called us to be the light of the world! Here is a clip from the movie of the change that happens when we choose to let our light shine: (Show clip of Buddys dad really singing) "
Feb-1-2015-sermon,"with this wonderful book that is a favorite for so many of us. Psalms is really the heart and soul of the heart and soul of the Bible. It answers the question How Do I Cope with Difficulty? There are 150 Psalms covering the spiritual journeys and history of the Jews. They are broken up into five books representing the Torah, the first five books of the Bible. The Psalms was a hymnbook for the Jews. They read it and sang from it as they worshipped. But what is powerful about the Psalms is that if you look deeper you see that the Psalms reflect the cycles of life. The Old Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann was the first one to recognize this profound aspect of the Psalms. In the beginning of the Psalms you see expressions about the blessings of life and how wonderful life is. It feels good to praise God. We see this in Psalm 8: LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens. Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger. When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them? 5 You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor. Life is good! But then life happens, right? We make mistakes or turn away from God and hurt ourselves or someone else makes a mistake and we suffer. Or the unfairness of life hits us. And the Psalms also reflect and give voice to those difficult times in our lives when we are hurt and angry with God. We feel this in Psalm 22:1-2: My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish? My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, but I find no rest. ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org The Psalms give us permission to question God and complain and get angry with God. Its okay! God can handle it! When we are in a relationship with God, he wants all of us, including our anger and pain! But then the Psalms also reflect those times when we realize our only hope is God and that he has been faithful in the past and we can trust him. We remember all the good things he has done. We see this in Psalm 13:5-6: But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation. I will sing the LORDs praise, for he has been good to me. And then of course the Psalms reveal those glorious times when we come out of the valley  when the suffering is over  when forgiveness comes  when the burden has been lifted and we feel alive again in God. Psalm 66 expresses this well: Come and hear, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me. I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue. If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened; but God has surely listened and has heard my prayer. Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me! We remember that God is so good and faithful. We remember that in difficulty and put our trust in God. He will see us through. So do you think the Bible is relevant to your life? Do you think it has something to say to you today? I believe it does. It certainly has many things to say to me. In fact, I will tell you a secret Ive never told. I often repeat a Psalm to myself whenever Im afraid or tempted or sad. It is Psalm 118:14: The LORD is my strength and my song; he has given me victory. And this I know for the Bible tells me so. Amen. -The Interpreters Bible Commentary, The Psalms and the Life of Faith by Walter Brueggemann, and Adam Hamiltons message on the Wisdom Literature were helpful resources for me as I prepared this sermon. Pasadena Community Church JJJJJooooouuuuurrrrrnnnnneeeeey yyyyTTTTThhhhhrrrrrooooouuuuugggggh hhhhttttthhhhhe eeeeBBBBBiiiiibbbbbllllle eeee~ The Wisdom Literature Sunday, February 1, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today we continue our series Journey through the Bible. In this series we are taking an exciting and informative journey through scripture. Many of you want to learn more about the Bible and the story of the Bible and this series gives you the opportunity to do that. Sometimes the church forgets to tell the story of scripture and this series allows you to immerse yourself in the biblical story and learn how God speaks to us through scripture. My hope is that these messages inspire you to go home, read your Bible and be transformed by it. Up to this point we have focused on the historical books of the Old Testament. These are the first 17 books that cover creation and the fall, Moses and the Exodus, the Hebrew people conquering the land of Canaan, the period of the Judges and the great Monarchy, the separation of the southern and northern kingdoms and their demise, and the eventual return of the Jews to the Promised Land. To learn more check out the first message of the series, The OT in 30 Minutes. Now we get to the heart and soul of the Bible  what is known as the Wisdom Literature. These are the five books of poetry that capture the phases of spiritual journeys that help us learn more about God and ourselves. They tell of the spiritual wisdom the Jews learned throughout their history and that wisdom is very relevant for us today. These books help us understand why we do what we do and the meaning of what we do. They articulate and give voice to all of our spiritual and emotional yearnings and what those yearnings teach us. In fact, the Wisdom Literature reveals just how relevant the Bible is to our lives. If we take time to read it, we will find the Bible is a very relevant book. I think the issue of relevancy is what prevents a lot of folks from reading the Bible. A lot of people think the Bible is filled with good ancient stories and proverbs but it really cannot speak to where and how we live in modern day. Perhaps that is how some of you feel today. You have a Bible at home. Maybe youve had it in your family for years. Maybe you got it as a gift from your grandparents for graduation years ago. Maybe your name is engraved on it! But, honestly, you havent read much of it on your own because you just dont think it will speak to your life. Or maybe youre someone who has had read a lot of the Bible but quite often you have a difficult time interpreting what it really means to you. You start reading it and it just doesnt make any sense. You want to grow in your faith by reading the Bible more but it is difficult for you. I believe this message today will help all of us see how relevant, encouraging and inspiring the Bible is to our lives and how God can speak to us through it. Because, believe or not the Wisdom Literature addresses five of some of the biggest questions people have about life and God. It addresses other questions, but these are the questions I want to focus on today. Have you ever asked these questions before: -Why Does God Allow Suffering? -How Does God Want Me to Live My Life? -What is the Meaning of Life? -How Does God Feel About Sex? -How Do I Cope with Difficulty? You may have never realized this but the Wisdom Literature of the Bible addresses those five questions. Does the Bible sound more relevant to you now? I bet it does! So lets dive right in and see what the Bible says about those five questions! We begin with a question that most of us have asked at one time or another. We often ask it when we are suffering  Why Does God Allow Suffering? The first book of Wisdom Literature is about that very question. It is the book of Job. Job is a poetic book that addresses a flawed belief about suffering, a belief that is still very popular today: If your life is good and everything is going well that means you are being good and God likes you. If life stinks and you are suffering that means you did something bad and you are not Gods favorite person. The book of Job corrects this flawed and harmful theological belief. Job is a story of a righteous man who suffered, and he suffered terribly. His crops and flock died. His servants died. His children died. And he got painful boils all over his body. So what did Jobs wife do? She told Job to just curse God and die? You have been faithful to God. You have been righteous. And yet God allows this to happen to you! Just curse God and die! There is no reason for you to go on living! Job replied, Thanks, sweetheart! I appreciate the encouragement! If thats not bad enough, Jobs friends began to drop by Jobs place to try to comfort him. But after all the condolences were offered they said, Come on Job, fess up. There is only one explanation for why your life is a mess. You did something that really made God mad. What was it? Why dont you just repent and your life will get better? Job replied, I didnt do anything wrong! Im not going to repent. I am righteous. I am going to trust God in the midst of my suffering even when I dont have the answers and even if I dont understand. Eventually Job began to question God about his suffering. He was righteous. Why did he suffer? Have you ever asked that question? Ive been good. Ive done all the right things. Why did this happen to me? Gods answer to Job and to us is found in Job 38:4-5: Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding. Who determined its measurements -surely you know! In other words, the question of suffering is beyond our scope. We cannot comprehend how God created the world. How can we comprehend the complexities of suffering in this world? So God never really gives an answer that we like. All God asks us of Job and us is that we trust him to walk us through the difficult times. Life is unfair sometimes. Life is painful sometimes. We dont have all the answers. But if we hold on to God he will see us through and redeem our suffering. And thats what happened to Job. He never gave up on God and God saw him through it and he ended up being blessed. Look how Job expressed his faith in the midst of suffering: I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand on the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; I myself will see him with my own eyesI, and not another. How my heart yearns within me! Job 19:25-27 We dont know why God allows suffering. We dont have all the answers. Freedom is only a partial answer. But we know, as Job knew, that God will see us through our suffering and will redeem it when we keep our trust in him. With God, the worst thing is never the last thing. Another book of Wisdom Literature addresses this important question: How Does God Want Me to Live My Life? Have you ever asked that? Have you ever wondered that? How does God want me to navigate my life? How do I make good decisions? Well the book of Proverbs addresses that question in a profound way. Proverbs is a book of pithy sayings that are attributed to Solomon who wrote them in the middle of his life. Solomon has grown up. He is no longer a young buck. He has learned a thing or two about life and how it works and he wants to share his wisdom. And what we learn from Solomon is that there is a big difference between knowledge and wisdom. What is that difference? It has been said that Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit; wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad! In other words, knowledge is knowing the truth. Wisdom is knowing how to apply it. If we are smart we will apply the wisdom of Proverbs early and often! The book of Proverbs helps us navigate through life by applying Gods truth. It explains the life God intends for us to live. It gives us Godly principles that, if we follow, will bring about life the way God intended. Now there are exceptions in life, as we just learned from Job. But, as a general rule, most of the time, if we follow the wisdom of Proverbs life will work and we will be blessed. Here is a passage from Proverbs that can stand on its own as a good summary of this wise book: Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and humankind. Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight. Do not be wise in your own eyes; respect the LORD and shun evil. This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones. Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the first fruits of all your crops; then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine. My son, do not despise the LORDs discipline, and do not resent his rebuke, because the LORD disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in. Proverbs 3:3-12 The next book of Wisdom Literature is the book of Ecclesiastes. Besides being the biblical book that Kevin Bacon quoted in Footloose to convince the stuffy preacher to allow a high school dance in his conservative town, it is a book that goes much deeper than telling us there is a time to dance! It answers the common question, What Is The Meaning of Life? Ecclesiastes is also attributed to Solomon, except this time Solomon is writing at the very end of his life. He is an old man reflecting on his long life and what he has learned. He realizes life has not been so simple and neat all the time. Life is not always black and white. As we read through Ecclesiastes, we see that Solomon came to see that sometimes we cant figure life out, but we can still trust God even though we dont understand. In other words, at the end of his life Solomon came to recognize the importance of mystery. We see this wisdom in key figures like Billy Graham. Over the years, he has become less and less black and white about every issue of faith. He is more broad minded in his twilight years. James Fowler, a brilliant scholar of faith development, said that the fifth and final stage of spiritual growth is being able to enjoy and appreciate paradox and mystery. At this stage trust and doubt can live together. We can trust God even thought we have doubts and questions and dont understand everything. We eventually learn that life and faith is not always about what we know but what we dont know. I have learned this in my own life. The older I get and the more I grow in my faith the bigger God gets and the more open I am to discovering and experiencing the depth and mystery of God. If God were small enough to contain and figure out he would not be big enough to believe in. But at the end of his life Solomon was certain about a few things. He was certain that life is seasonal. Growth comes in stages. He reflected on this truth in the most well known passage of the book: There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens: a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 Old Solomon also learned that most of what we think is important in life is empty and meaningless. Vanity, vanity, all is vanity. What does that mean? All of life is empty and meaningless. For example, if Solomon were preaching to you today he would say, Enjoy the big game today but just remember that in a hundred years no one is going to remember or care who won the Super Bowl in 2015. For Solomon, success, things, money, power and fame never satisfy. I like how he put it in Ecclesiastes 5:10: Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless. And so for Solomon what did have meaning? What really matters in life? What is the meaning of life? He tells us plainly in Ecclesiastes 12:13-14: Here is the conclusion of the matter: Respect and obey God! This is what life is all about. God will judge everything we do, even what is done in secret, whether good or bad. In the end, all that matters is our relationship with God and what we have done for God. Thats the meaning of life  to glorify God and enjoy him forever! Well, we come to the next question and book. And I think God had a smile on his face when he included this book in the Bible. It is the Song of Solomon and it answers the question How Does God Feel About Sex? I think God included this book because many people of faith have a tendency to get uptight about sex. The Jews were unsure whether to include Song of Solomon in their scriptures. And over the years Christians have mistakenly tried to explain it away as a metaphor for divine love. But the truth is Song of Solomon is a poetic letter Solomon wrote when he was a young man filled with passion and love for a woman he was about to marry. He was madly in love with her and you can see it expressed in the book. He describes his desire to kiss her and his longing to touch her. I want to keep this service G rated so I will not lift up those passages in worship today. But I bet I know which book of the Bible some of you will be reading when you get home today! I may get calls  Charley, I cant believe it! My husband is actually reading the Bible! Song of Solomon teaches us that God sees sex as wonderful. After all it was his idea, not Madonnas! It is a life giving gift as long as we enjoy it the way God intended. Finally we get to the book of Psalms. It does not come last in the collection, but I wanted to end "
Feb-22-2015-sermon,"Revelation is interpreted in many different ways but regardless of your interpretation Revelation teaches us that God has the Last Word! The opening chapters are important to understanding this unique book. They tell of seven churches in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) who had compromised their faith or were in danger of compromising their faith. The Lords message to them was simple: God would ultimately triumph over the Roman Empire and every other empire. God would have the last word. Those followers who remained faithful to God would triumph over evil and find life in this life and the life to come. In other words, those of us who rely on God as our strength know the worst thing is never the last thing. Revelation 21 expresses it eloquently: Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Look! Gods dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away. Revelation 21:1-4 Well, there you have it  the New Testament in about 30 minutes. The gospels reveal Jesus showing us the heart and character of God. The Acts of the Apostles teach us that the church is Gods best hope for the world. The Epistles teach us that each of us plays a key role in the church. And the book of Revelation teaches us that God has the last word. Amen. ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org Pasadena Community Church JJJJJooooouuuuurrrrrnnnnneeeeey yyyyTTTTThhhhhrrrrrooooouuuuugggggh hhhhttttthhhhhe eeeeBBBBBiiiiibbbbbllllle eeee~ The New Testament in 30 Minutes Sunday, February 22, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today we begin the second half of our series, Journey Through the Bible by turning our attention to the New Testament. Two weeks ago we finished our tour through the Old Testament and I hope it gave you an appreciation for the Old Testament and how God speaks to us through the history of the Jewish people. What you are going to see in the new few weeks is how rooted the New Testament is in the Old Testament. You often hear people say, Well, the Old Testament really doesnt matter. We have the New Testament and Jesus now and the Old Testament really doesnt apply. Well, that is untrue. We as Christians believe that the Old Testament and New Testament are grafted together. The New Testament grew out of the Old Testament. Having said that, today I am going to tell you about the group of books in the Bible which point to and get their inspiration from the most influential person in the history of the world. More songs have been written about this person, more artwork has been created of him and more books have been written about him than any other person who ever lived. In fact, this person had such an influence on history that we measure time by him. Our calendar is divided into the years before and after his birth  BC and AD. I am talking about Jesus Christ. As we take an exciting journey through the New Testament today and the next few weeks you are going to experience why Jesus was the most influential person in history. And you are also going to see why he was more than an historical figure  but a person who has transformed countless lives and can change your life too. Because the four sections of the New Testament express the world changing impact of Jesus Christ and we are going to break those down today. There are approximately 23,145 verses in the Protestant Old Testament, and 7,958 verses in the New Testament. This means that the Old Testament makes up three-fourths of the Bible, and the New Testament one-fourth. Oh, but what a one-fourth it is! If you want to learn more about how the New Testament came together, check out my message Making the Cut. But right now I want to lift up the four sections of the New Testament and what they teach us about Jesus Christ. Of course, the New Testament begins with the four gospels. And the gospels show us Jesus Revealing the Heart and Character of God. Have you ever wondered what God is really like? Have you ever wondered about Gods nature and what he wants with us? Then look no further than the Gospels. A lot of folks make assumptions about God  he is angry, he is distant, he is a divine policeman. Well, before you make up your mind lets take a look at what God actually said and did when he was in human form and walked this earth. The Gospels tell the story of the birth, life, teachings, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. And the gospel writers had one purpose in writing  to show us that God loves the world so much that he took human form in Jesus Christ to show us what he is like, to teach us how to live, and to go all the way to the cross to redeem us and give us new life. These gospel writers believed that Jesus over powered death and sin and by trusting him and following him we can find life, joy, peace, hope, wholeness and purpose. The Gospels show us that we dont have to search for God, but God has come searching for us in Christ to give us new life. So, if you want to know what God is like, just start reading the gospels and watch what Jesus says and does. The gospel of John puts it this way in John 1:14: And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. The Word in Greek is Logos. Logos means the mind, essence and creative energy of God. So, what this verse communicates is that Jesus is the mind, essence and creative energy of God in human form! Why would God go to such trouble? Jesus said that he came to seek and save the lost. Are you lost today? Have you made so many wrong turns in your life that you dont who you are or where you should go? Are you afraid of where you are going and where you might end up? Well the good news of Christ, and (gospel means good news) is that Jesus can find you. In fact, he has never lost you. He has always had his loving eyes on you. There is a passage in the gospel of Luke that is a powerful illustration of Jesus finding the lost: Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd. 4 So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way. When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today. So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly. All the people saw this and began to mutter, He has gone to be the guest of a sinner. But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount. Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost. Luke 19:1-9 Notice that Jesus knew exactly where Zacchaeus was. Zacchaeus didnt go to Jesus. Jesus came to him. Jesus knew Zacchaeus needed him. He knew he was lost. Wherever you are today I want you to know that Jesus knows where you are and he wants to come and live in the home of your heart. And it doesnt matter what you have done Jesus can find you and make you whole. He can find you and forgive you. He can find you and redeem you. When we make the decision to follow Jesus and live our lives inspired and empowered by him, he expects us to do one thing, the one thing he taught and demonstrated so well  live a life of love. It is the life of love empowered by Christ that will transform this world. What is this life of love? Jesus told us plainly in Matthew: Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law? Jesus replied: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments. Matthew 22:35-40 In each of the gospels, Jesus reveals the heart and character of God. So what can we surmise about God based upon Jesus as seen in the gospels? Jesus demonstrates: Gods frustration with religious hypocrisy, Gods compassion for those who are poor and oppressed, Gods mercy toward those who sin, and Gods healing power for those who are broken. Based on who Jesus is what are we called to do? Jesus calls human beings into right relationship with God. Jesus commands us to love God and neighbor, and insists that this love includes compassion for the hungry and forgiveness for those who sin against us. Jesus demands that we apply this love to our enemies. Whats great about what we read about Jesus in the gospels is that he didnt just walk the walk. He talked the talked. He went all the way to the cross to demonstrate Gods relentless love and grace for humankind. In fact, as he was suffering on the cross, he forgave those who were torturing him! After Jesus died the great love and power of God resurrected Jesus from the dead. Jesus resurrection demonstrated Gods triumph over sin, evil, hopelessness, despair, and death. And when we put our trust in Christ, the same power that raised him from the dead will live in us and give us new life now and life everlasting. After his resurrection, Jesus sent his disciples into the world to announce his power and love and to lead a revolution that would change the world. And he calls those of us who follow him to do the same. This call is found in Matthew 28:16-20, and it is called the Great Commission: Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. That is the gospel story. It is contained in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. We will take a closer look at them next week and see how each of the gospels tell the gospel story in their own unique way. The next section of the New Testament is the Acts of the Apostles. Acts is the second part to the gospel of Luke. Acts begins where the gospels end. Following the resurrection and ascension of Christ, the early Christians were filled with the Holy Spirit and, through the Spirits influence and power, continued the ministry of Jesus, healing the sick, casting out demons, and teaching and preaching about Christ and the kingdom he had announced. In other words the book of Acts tells us the story of the birthday of the church, its powerful beginning and how the Holy Spirit empowered the church to change the world with the gospel. Acts teaches us that The Church is Gods Best Hope for the World. Listen to how Gods chosen vessel got its start: When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. 2 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. 3 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. 4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit Peter said, Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far offfor all whom the Lord our God will call..41 Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. 42 They devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. 43 Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. 44 All the believers were together and had everything in common. 45 They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. 46 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, 47 praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved. Acts 2 When we read Acts and see the power of the early church and what God has called the church to do we come to the realization that Pasadena Community Church is not a charity organization or an event center or a concert hall or a recreational center. We are the body of Christ! We are Gods chosen vessel in the world! God has chosen the church to be his change agent in the world. When we pray and are faithful God can do extraordinary things! If you study church history you see the impact God has made on the world through the church  in education, in health care, in social justice, in poverty, in the healing of the world! The church is not perfect, but the church is still the greatest things God has going for him in this world and if God is going to do something significant he is going to do it through his church. The gospel is not something that just floats around on its own. It is rooted, sustained, supported and organized by the church through the power of Holy Spirit. What other institution in the world can do what church does? The church is Gods best hope for the world. The church is infinitely stronger than most people understand. It can withstand anything the world throws at it because it is sustained and empowered by God! The church thrives and provides love, affirmation and community to the left out, down and out, thrown out and the bruised, broken, and beaten. It changes lives with the gospel of Jesus Christ! After Acts, we find the Epistles or letters of the New Testament. Thirteen of the twenty-one letters of the New Testament are attributed to a man named Paul. Paul was a Jewish Pharisee who initially sought to suppress the Christian movement. However he himself was converted to Christ and became its greatest evangelist. He took the gospel across the Roman Empire, establishing churches everywhere he went. Adam Hamilton offers a great description of Paul and his letters: Paul started new faith communities, set aside leaders in these fledgling churches, and then would leave to go preach in another town. When those leaders had questions or concerns, they sent messages to Paul, who wrote letters in response. His letters taught, encouraged, and sought to offer practical advice and help to these new Christians. Others also wrote to various communities doing much the samechallenging, encouraging, correcting, and teaching. Twenty-one of the twenty-seven New Testament books are letters from the apostles, mostly from Paul. And what do these letters teach us? Well, a lot! But today I want to underscore that they teach us that Each Jesus Follower has a Key Role to Play in the Church. We all have a role to play in the church. In one of Pauls letters he articulates this message beautifully: Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. 13 For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one bodywhether Jews or Gentiles, slave or freeand we were all given the one Spirit to drink. 14 Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. 19 If they were all one part, where would the body be? 20 As it is, there are many parts, but one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, I dont need you! And the head cannot say to the feet, I dont need you! .If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. 27 Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. -1st Cor. 12 We all play an important role in the church. You see, you can be a Christian without going to church, but not a very good one! I dont know any Christian who is growing and serving effectively who is not active in a local church. In fact, I challenge anyone to find me one person who is a healthy Christian who is not active in a church. We need the church! There is no such thing as an isolated Christian. It is biblically impossible. Once you receive Christ as Savior you are grafted into the body of Christ. Paul told us in this passage that we all play a key role in the body of Christ and we need each other. Together, by the power of God, we achieve more for God. Finally, the New Testament ends with a book filled with peculiar visions of the conflict between God and evil and of evils final defeat  the book of Revelation. "
Feb-8-2015-sermon,"How can I do more? You can start by giving your time and gifts to the church because PCC is living out the message of the Prophets and we want to do more. I know many of you are already serving but I also there are others who need a little nudge. PCC is actively involved in caring for Gods people! I dare say if every person who came to worship each week, which is an average about 1100 people, would commit to serving those in need in some way for an hour or two a week St. Pete would be a beacon of Gods hope and healing to the rest of the country. Do you talk to God like you used to? Do you still care about God? Do you care about his people? When was the last time you spoke with God and listened to him? When was the last time you listened to his heart through scripture and heard his cry for his people in need? You know so often we only think of justice and mercy and caring for the weak in terms of those who are hungry or have some physical need. But the message of the prophets is broader than that. We are called by God to defend and help anyone who is helpless, powerless, oppressed and abused. So I want to end my message by bringing it home to where most of us live every day. Think about the folks we see and interact with everyday who need defending, who need our protection, who need for us to speak up for them. I think about the people who serve us. You can tell a lot about people by how they treat those who serve them. You want to really get to know a person? Take them to a restaurant and watch how they interact with those who serve them. I want to share with you the testimony of someone who lived out the message of the Prophets in a powerful way. The following testimony is from Rev. Jim McWhinnie, my predecessor, who brought many gifts to this church: ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org At a local restaurant last night, three elderly gentlemen were sitting in the booth next to where my wife and I were seated. When the young waitress delivered their orders, apparently one of the orders was not prepared as how the man had requested. I do not know if it was or not, we arrived after they had ordered. Well, he blew up and tore into the server long and hard ... she offered, ""Sir, I'm sorry I misunderstood. Let me take it back and get it right."" But that did not suffice ... he went on and on berating this young waitress. The other two men simply remained silent. On and on he tore into her. And in the end, he kept the order, dismissing her with disdain. I was impressed with the young waitress' endurance of his rage. After she left, I stood up -to my wife's horror and faced the man. He shouted at me, ""What are you looking at? Mind your own business!"" I responded ... I thought calmly yet forthrightly ...""I am looking at a mean, old man who likes to beat up on young women ... and how you treated that young lady IS my business ... did you ever think she might be my daughter?"" He started to rise but the other two men hushed him up. When we received our check, our waitress wrote on the check ...""Thank you for being a Dad when my friend needed one ... dinner is on all of us servers. Again, thank you."" (Taken from his journal entry on Face Book, dated January 21st, 2015). If we care about God, we will care about Gods people. Amen. Pasadena Community Church JJJJJooooouuuuurrrrrnnnnneeeeey yyyyTTTTThhhhhrrrrrooooouuuuugggggh hhhhttttthhhhhe eeeeBBBBBiiiiibbbbbllllle eeee~ Prophets and Kings Sunday, February 8, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Micah 6:Today we continue our series Journey through the Bible. In this series we are taking an exciting and informative journey through scripture. Many of you want to learn more about the Bible and the story of the Bible and this series gives you the opportunity to do that. This series allows you to immerse yourself in the biblical story and learn how God speaks to us through scripture. My hope is that these messages inspire you to go home, read your Bible and be transformed by it. Today we conclude the Old Testament section of this series. We have covered a lot of territory in a short amount of time. I began with a whirlwind tour of the entire Old Testament in 30 minutes. We learned about the historical books of the Old Testament. These are the first 17 books that cover creation and the fall, Moses and the Exodus, the Hebrew people conquering the land of Canaan, the period of the Judges and the great Monarchy, the separation of the southern and northern kingdoms and their demise, and the eventual return of the Jews to the Promised Land. Then we took a closer look at three key figures in the Old Testament: Abraham, Moses and Joshua. We learned powerful lessons about them and their faithfulness to God. Last week we summarized the next collection of books in the Old Testament called the Wisdom Literature. We learned why these five books are called the heart and soul of the Bible. They document the spiritual wisdom the Jewish people learned throughout their history. We came to see how relevant that wisdom is for our lives today. Today we conclude the Old Testament side to this series by taking a closer look at the last collection of books in the Old Testament  The Prophetic Books, the last 17 books of the Old Testament. We are going to hear the message the prophets gave to the Kings of Israel and Judah and, as we do, we are going to see how relevant that message is for us today. The message of the Prophets is perhaps the most important message for us to hear today as Christians. But sadly, it is probably the most ignored message of the Bible. For the message of the Prophets reveals what breaks Gods heart. Now I imagine you are thinking, Well, when you think about all the awful things going on in this world there must be a lot of things that break Gods heart. And you would be right. But there is a common thread weaved throughout the Bible which reveals what is at the top of the list of things that break Gods heart and conversely what warms Gods heart. And I cant think of a more critical time for us to hear the message of the Prophets than right now. It is difficult for us to hear this message, which is why Prophets then and prophets now are not very popular. And it also why the message of the Prophets is often ignored or overshadowed by other biblical messages. Think about it. Those of you who come to church a fair amount, I bet most of you can count on one hand the number of sermons you have heard based upon a Prophet. In fact, I will confess to you that over the years I have preached very few sermons on the Prophets. And shame on me for that. I had a professor in seminary who once told our class, A quick way to exit a church as a pastor is to preach a steady diet of sermons on the Prophets. Ouch! Why is that? Well because when you faithfully preach the message of the Prophets it is rather convicting. And when you convict people it doesnt always make you very popular. When you preach the truth in love by lifting up what we do that breaks Gods heart you dont win a lot of friends. In fact, when you take a closer look at the ministry of Jesus you see that Jesus was threatened and ultimately killed because he preached the message of the Prophets. And let me say a word to those of you here who dont consider yourselves religious or Christian. Maybe you have come for just this series. Maybe a friend invited you to church. Whatever the case, you are always welcome here. I am willing to bet that if you have had difficulty with the church or Christians or have been turned off by the faith in some way, a big reason has to do with what got the Prophets so riled up! So you are in good company! It has been the churchs failure to hear and apply the message of the Prophets that has caused much of the disdain folks have of Christians and the church. Folks, dont get me wrong. My intention today is not to discourage you. I love the church and believe it is Gods best hope for the world. The church is doing a lot of things right. And it is because I believe this that I feel led and compelled to lift up the message of the Prophets. Because I dont want to break Gods heart and I know you dont want to break Gods heart! I want to warm Gods heart and make him proud. And we cant do that unless we hear and apply the message of the Prophets. So lets take a closer look at the Prophets and their message to the Kings, to the people of God, and to us. Whats important to understand is that the Prophets emerged by the power of God to be the moral conscience of the Jewish people. And a big part of their job was to evaluate the work of the Kings. They challenged the status quo and spoke truth to power. And, as we all know, that can be a dangerous job. You will remember that the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms, Israel in the north and Judah in the south. These two Kingdoms for many years had kings who ruled over each of them. And if you look at the succession of kings in both of the kingdoms you quickly see that most of them were terrible kings. In fact, over and over you see that the Bible said this about most of them: They did evil in the sight of the Lord. A few kings in Judah were good, but most of them, according to the Prophets, did evil in the sight of the Lord. For example King Ahab was the seventh King of Israel who reigned somewhere in the middle of the 800s B.C. He lived in an ivory palace with his wife Jezebel. They oppressed the poor among them and turned away from God by worshipping other gods. You see, when the Prophets evaluated the kings they simply asked two questions: Were they faithful to God and did they care for people? And, believe it or not, most of the kings failed miserably in those two areas. Gods message to them through the Prophets was simple: Repent and obey God and you will receive grace and forgiveness. Turn away from God and you will no longer be protected and your corruption will destroy your kingdom. Now, most of the kings didnt start off corrupt. They started off feeling honored to serve the Lord as kings and take care of Gods people. So how did they go so far astray? How did these kings, knowing God was trusting them to be faithful, fail so miserably? What happened? Take a wild guess! The answer then is the same answer now. What happened to those kings also happens to leaders today. Wealth, power and vanity took hold of them and their greed and selfishness blinded them to the vision of who God. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. We see example after example of this today  from politicians to preachers  from corporate CEOs to revered leaders of the church. Power is seductive and throughout history power has corrupted good people and damaged countless lives. The story of the Kings of Israel is the same story now. Their story is our story. Not much has changed. As the Bible says, There is nothing new under the son. And one thing we learn about those who want more power than they should have is that they usually get it by taking advantage of the weak, vulnerable, and helpless. So the Prophets were the moral conscience of the people of God. Their message was that there would be consequences for not caring for the weak and vulnerable. And this message is everywhere throughout the Prophets. You cant get away from it. One of the most powerful passages concerning justice for the weak comes from Isaiah. Here Isaiah is condemning the city of Jerusalem for the way it has treated the weak (1:21-27): See how Jerusalem, once so faithful, has become a prostitute. Once the home of justice and righteousness, she is now filled with murderers. Once like pure silver, you have become like worthless slag. Once so pure, you are now like watered-down wine. Your leaders are rebels, the companions of thieves. All of them love bribes and demand payoffs, but they refuse to defend the cause of orphans or fight for the rights of widows. Notice that justice and righteousness are held together. To be righteous means to practice justice. And what did the Prophets mean by justice? They meant to practice grace and mercy towards those who have no power to secure it for themselves (Dennis Bratcher, Social Ethics in the Prophets). Biblical justice means to protect and defend those who are helpless and powerless, and widows and orphans were the most vulnerable and weak in their society. 150 years after Isaiah the prophet Jeremiah still saw the mistreatment of the powerless and defenseless people in society as one of the primary evidences of unrighteousness and sin. He had these hard words for Judahs king, Jehoiakim (Jer 22:3, 13-17): This is what the LORD says: Be fair-minded and just. Do what is right! Help those who have been robbed; rescue them from their oppressors. Quit your evil deeds! Do not mistreat foreigners, orphans, and widows. Stop murdering the innocent! And the LORD says, What sorrow awaits Jehoiakim, who builds his palace with forced labor. He builds injustice into its walls, for he makes his neighbors work for nothing. He does not pay them for their labor. He says, I will build a magnificent palace with huge rooms and many windows. I will panel it throughout with fragrant cedar and paint it a lovely red. But a beautiful cedar palace does not make a great king! Your father, Josiah, also had plenty to eat and drink. But he was just and right in all his dealings. That is why God blessed him. He gave justice and help to the poor and needy, and everything went well for him. Isnt that what it means to know me? says the LORD. But you! You have eyes only for greed and dishonesty! You murder the innocent, oppress the poor, and reign ruthlessly. I like how Dennis Bratcher explains this text: In Hebrew to know someone was a way to describe the most personal and intimate relationship between persons. Here, knowing God is equated with concrete social actions for the poor and needy. In fact, in these verses compassion and justice for the powerless is what defines the role of a king, not how great his buildings are (Social Ethics in the Prophets). So being in relationship with God means taking care of the needy, the oppressed and defending those who are weak. So what breaks Gods heart? What brings God to tears? When we do not take care of the weak, hungry, needy and oppressed among us! The bottom line is that If We Care about God We Will Care about His People. Does that message sound familiar? Jesus would come and tell us that he came to rescue the oppressed. He came and told us that when we do something for the least among us it is like we are doing it to him. He told us that the greatest commandment was to love God and to love people as much as we love ourselves. If we care about God, we will care about his people, especially the weak and the vulnerable. And if we dont then our relationship with God is called into question. That is an essential message from scripture. However, it is one we do not hear often enough. Growing up, the faith I was taught was primarily a personal one. I dont mean that my family and church did not serve others. Indeed we did! But social ethics and the call of God in scripture to defend and help the weak was not emphasized very much. I learned a lot about a personal relationship with Jesus, personal salvation, and personal prayer. I learned a lot about worship, telling others about Jesus and everlasting life. And I am grateful I learned these things because they are critically important and very biblical. But as I grew in my faith and read more of the Bible I saw the message of the Prophets ringing through. My faith in God is not just about me! My faith is not just personal, it is social! I have a responsibility to take care of Gods people! If I love God, I cannot ignore the needs of those others. If I care about God, I will care about his people. If I dont, it is seen as sin in Gods eyes. It breaks Gods heart because God has blessed me and blessed you to be a blessing. As good Protestants we believe we have been saved by grace. And we have! And thank God for that because without Gods grace we would all be in deep yogurt. But we have been saved by grace for something! And that something is to bring healing and wholeness to this world by the power of God. And the world needs it so bad. Let me give you some statistics. Did you know the world produces enough food to feed every person on earth? And yet the policies and power structures in this world leave millions without access to food, land, and water. Did you know there 805 million hungry people in the world? Did you know that every year 2.5 million children die from malnutrition? Did you know that over 49 million Americans do not have enough food to eat? (source: whyhunger.org). And now think of all the food that is thrown out at home, in restaurants and in grocery stores. In the US, there are 45.3 million people who are living in poverty, including 14.7 million children. The vast majority of farmers, those who grow, pick, and process our food, live in poverty and cannot afford to buy adequate healthy food. Half the worlds population live on less than $2.50 a day (source: whyhunger.org). Do you think the message of the Prophets is relevant to us today? Does our heart break for those who are broken? Compared to most of the world, most of us here are rich and covered in resources. How do we live when we have what we have and others are weak and vulnerable and lacking? How are we using our resources to help those in need, to care for Gods people? As Micah the prophet proclaimed: He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God? Micah 6:8 One of the things I love is that when I go out into the community I find out that people know PCC as a church that cares about those in need. We have so many ministries that serve those in need in our community (Pack a Sack, Food Pantry, Assistance Programs, Scholarships, and ESOL to name a few). But we could be doing so much more! Some of you know that we have a church kitchen that is the envy of restaurants, hotels and chefs. Its the Ritz Carlton of church kitchens. And we use it to cook meals for various events and programs. However, we could be doing so much more with it! A couple of weeks ago I had a wonderful conversation with Anita Marshall and Debbie Breitweiser, who head up our hospitality ministry and they shared something from their hearts about our kitchen. They told me they want to start using our wonderful kitchen to make meals for those in need in the community. They want to prepare meals and disperse them to other ministries and nonprofits who serve those in need. They wanted my blessing. I told them it was a no brainer! I was thrilled! So right now our hospitality team is taking time to plan a ministry that utilizes our kitchen to care for more of Gods people! So, you may be asking, How do I get involved? "
Jan-11-2015-sermon,"Just imagine where that obedience to God will take you. Remember that obedience leads to blessing. And thats what B stands for! B stands for blessing. Take a look again at what God says to Abraham in Genesis 12:2: I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. Abraham was blessed to be a blessing! At the end of the day, God blessed Abraham so that he could be a blessing to others! And what a blessing he was! Folks, we are blessed by God to be a blessing. Thats your purpose and my purpose in life. And until we figure that out, we will never find meaning and fulfillment in life. Mark my words: The happiest people in the world are the ones who have figured this out and the most miserable people on earth are those who havent. There are two types of people in the world  those who always look around for what they dont have, who always feel like they dont have enough, who take, take, and take. Then there are those who see everything they have as a blessing and ask each day, How can I bless others with my blessings? Which one are you? Do you look for ways to be a blessing to others with what you have or do you always feel you dont have enough? After people leave your presence, do they feel blessed to have been with you or do they feel like that time with you was time they will never get back? What do you have that will bless others? This is 77 year old James Harrison of Australia. When he was 14 years old he underwent major chest surgery and almost died. He required 3 gallons of blood to survive the surgery. Realizing the blood had saved his life, he vowed that when he was old enough to donate blood he would do it the rest of his life. James started donating blood in 1954 and soon it was discovered that his blood contained a special antibody that cured Rhesus disease, the most common blood disease in newborns. In 2011, Harrison reached a blood donation record of 1,000. That is one donation every 3 weeks, and he never misses an opportunity. Even on vacation, he makes sure to stop by a donor center. He is known as the man with a golden arm because over the course of 57 years he has saved the lives of over 2.2 million babies. Harrison says, ""More and more blood is needed every day, so if every current donor brought along one friend we wouldn't have the sort of shortage we have at the moment,"" he said. ""An hour of your time is a lifetime for someone else."" Just as Abraham used his blessings to give life to so many, Harrison used his gift to give life to so many. And, of course, Jesus gave his life to give life to the whole world. All of us are blessed by God to be a blessing. Remember F.T.O.B.  Bea Friend of God, Trust in God, Obey God and Bless others for God. You remember that and follow it and you will never be the same.

For the next several weeks we are taking an exciting and informative journey through scripture. We will be covering the main themes and characters in the Old Testament and New Testament. In this journey we will learn how God speaks to us through scripture. The big reason for this series is the hunger I sense many of you have to know more about the overall story of the Bible. Sometimes the church just forgets to tell the story of scripture. Most of the time when you come to church you just get bits and pieces of the Bible. This series gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself in the whole biblical story and be transformed by it. Last week I broke the Guinness Book of World Records by covering the entire Old Testament in 30 minutes. Not really. Well, the world record part. I did give a whirl wind trip through the Old Testament in 30 minutes by allowing you to hear the entire Old Testament story of the Jewish people. For the next few weeks we will focus on some of the main themes and characters in the Old Testament. As I said last week, this series just scratches the surface. My hope is that these messages compel you to run home, dust off your Bible and devour it and be transformed by how God speaks to you through it. Today we look at the book of Genesis. We move through the first eleven chapters of universal salvation history and find the story of Creation and the Fall, Cain and Abel, Noah and the Ark, and the Tower of Babel. All of those stories are important and I encourage you to read them. But today we focus on one of the key characters in Genesis and the entire Bible: Abraham. The lessons his life and faith teach us are essential for a vibrant faith. If you struggle with trusting God, Abraham is your man! This morning you are going to find out why. I remember first learning about Abraham in Sunday school as a kid. We would sing songs about him. I would get up in worship with my class and sing, Father Abraham has many sons.. As a kid, I knew he was important somehow. He had many descendants and those descendants were ultimately related to me. But I didnt realize how important Abraham was until I got older. In fact, the story of Abraham became very important to me when I felt God calling me into ordained ministry. I was just 16 years old. I had zits on my face and I had a crush on a girl. I was really into tennis and other sports. But soon I began to sense Gods call in my heart to preach. I was clueless. I didnt know what to do. Me a preacher? Where do I go? How do I go about doing this? What if I fail? I recall speaking to a sweet lady in our church who was a youth counselor. I told her about my call and the anxious feelings I had about it. She asked, Remember Abraham? Go reread his story again. I think it will help you. Well, I did go back and reread the story of Abraham and he came alive for me. In fact, the story of Abraham encouraged and empowered me to take the next step and follow Gods call into ministry. Thats how important the story of Abraham is to me. And I believe his story can be just as important to you. There is a reason why the entire biblical story is rooted in the story of Abraham and his descendants. The lessons Abrahams life teach us about our faith are foundational because Abrahams story empowers us to trust God completely with our lives. Have you ever struggled with trusting God? I think most of us have. Have you ever felt led by God in a certain way but you were terrified and didnt know where it would take you? Maybe thats where you are today. You feel led by God to do the right thing but you are concerned where that will take you. You feel led by God to make some kind of change in your life but you are terrified of change and you dont know what that change might look like. Perhaps you are barely hanging on today. Life has torn you apart. Prayers have not been answered. And you are ready to give up on your prayers and give up on God. And maybe you feel like you just cant bring yourself to trust God anymore. Well, hold on. Take a breath and allow yourself to hear the lessons of Abraham. They just might be a game changer for you. They just might be exactly what you need to take that next step, make that change, and revitalize your faith in God. So here is what I want you to do. If you are taking notes, just write these letters down horizontally: F, T, O, B. I got this nifty acrostic from Adam Hamilton. These letters reveal the powerful lessons of Abrahams life that just might make all the difference to you today. You ready? F signifies a key lesson for us when seeking the courage to trust in God. Just consider this. At the beginning of Abrahams life he worshipped many gods. That was the world and culture he group in. They had a god for everything. But Abraham had an epiphany one day and came to the place where he realized there was only one God  only one creator  only one Lord of the universe. This was a very radical idea at the time. No one had even considered that. This is why Abraham is called the Father of Monotheism (the belief in one God). It all started with Abraham! But I will tell you what is even more radical. Not only did Abraham discover there was only one God. He also came to know and understand the character of this God that created everything. And Abraham came to know and experience this God not as a distant God or an angry God or an absentee God but a God who was knowable and loving and a God who desired to be close to us, to be in relationship with us. Abrahams experience of this knowable, loving, intimate God was revolutionary. In fact, the Bible gives Abraham the greatest compliment. I dont think there is a higher compliment. In 2nd Chronicles 20:7 and Isaiah 41:8 Abraham is called A Friend of God. I want that on my tombstone! He was Gods friend. A friend to God! So the F stands for Friend of God. Do you have friendships where you do all the giving? You do favors for them but they never do favors for you. You call them but they never call you. You listen to them but they never really listen to you. You are a friend to them but they are never really a friend to you. I think most of us have had or have those kinds of relationships. And you come to accept it. Thats just the way it is. Adam Hamilton once remarked that quite often our relationship with God is one sided like that. God is a friend to us. He does all the listening, all the giving, all the loving, all the blessing. We ask and he gives, but do we ever consider being a friend to God? Do we ever consider doing things for God? The Bible tells me that God has a need for us to reciprocate his love, to love him back. After all, why do you think he created us? God has a need for companionship. I dont know about you, but I want to be a friend to God. I want to say, Lord, thank you for being a friend to me. You have done so much for me. You have loved and saved me. You have given me so many blessings. I want to be your friend. You are already my Lord and Savior, and now I want to be your friend. I want to think more of you than I do myself. This was Abrahams heart. This is who Abraham was  a friend of God. This is why God chose Abraham to be the father of monotheism and the foundation of the Bible and the Hebrew people. It wasnt because he was sophisticated or rich or powerful or notable in any way. Heck, when God got a hold of Abraham he was at the back end of his life, 75 years old. He had no offspring. He worshipped many gods. He had terrible theology. He lied. He was deceptive. He was divorced. And God chose him! God has a habit of choosing the most unlikely people! Ever heard the song by Garth Brooks, Ive Got Friends in Low Places? Well, thats the story of God in many ways. Moses was a stutterer. David was young and rowdy. God in Christ chose disciples who couldnt read or write. Jesus hung out with prostitutes and sinners and often made them the heroes. God picks the most unlikely people like Abraham because they are available and they are willing to be Gods friend. Now we get to T. As you consider T, I want to lift up a pivotal moment in Abrahams story. It appears in Genesis 12:1-3: Now the LORD said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your fathers house to the land that I will show you. 2 I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. 3 I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. So here is Abraham minding his own business and God tells him to call the UHaul Company, pack up the trailer, and leave his home. Ah, God, where do you want me to go? Ill show you. Can you show me now? I will tell you when you need to know. Um, God, in order to convince my wife Sarah it would be helpful to know where I am going. Abraham, just trust me. Pack everything up and go. Now can you imagine Abraham coming home that day to Sarah? Sarah is sitting in the living room watch Family Feud and Abraham says, Uh, sweetheart, I spoke with God today and he wants us to move. Where does he want us t move? You know, he didnt really say? What?! He just told me to call the U-Haul company, pack up our things and go. And he didnt say where? No. Abraham were you not listening? You know sometimes you dont hear a word I say, so maybe you were not listening. No, honey, I was listening. He didnt tell me where we are going. Now the Bible does not say but I believe there is a piece of the story missing here. I think Abrahams real conversation with Sarah is left out. Because my theory is that Sarah is the one who convinced Abraham to go. Lets face it. Behind every good man is an even better woman! Abraham listened to Sarah and Sarah said, You pray and Ill pack! Lets be honest. If Sarah had said no, Abraham would not have gone! So in Genesis 12:4 we read nine very important words in the Bible: So Abram went, as the LORD had told him. Abraham and Sarah left their home having no clue where God was leading them. But he promised them children and many descendants. He promised to answer their prayers. And God was faithful and honored Abrahams faith and eventually God would lead him to the Promised Land! What kind of people do this? Those who have great trust in God! And great trust in God is letting go and allowing God to be great in your life. In fact, the Bible mentions Abrahams great faith in God over 31 times! It was his faith that the rest of the Bible is built upon. Take a look at what the New Testament says about Abraham in Hebrews 11:8-12: By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going. By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised.For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too oldand Sarah herself was barrenbecause he considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore. Abrahams faith is so inspiring. He was just like you and me, but he had the good sense to trust God even when he had no idea where he was going. And look how God blessed him! What I have learned is that there is a time to wrestle with God and then there is a time to trust God. Perhaps today, whatever your struggle is, it is time to trust God. He is faithful. Now we get to the O. The O stands for Obedience. It says, An Abraham went. He trusted God and then he put one foot in front of the other and obeyed God. Sometimes the hardest trip to make is from faith to obedience. But obedience makes all the difference in the world! Obedience is what opens the door for Gods purpose of our lives. If God called you tonight to sell your home and leave town without knowing exactly what would be next, would you do it? Is God speaking to you today? Is God nudging your heart today to move out of your comfort zone and do something extraordinary for him? Is God asking you to trust him in a way you have never trusted him before? I dont think we are truly obeying God unless from time to time we are forced to trust him beyond our comfort zone. Maybe in the silence you feel that pull from God. Maybe in this message you have felt that pull. Perhaps lately as you read scripture you feel that pull from God. Maybe it is to do the right thing and speak up for someone. Maybe it is a new ministry God has gifted you to start. Maybe it is just inviting a neighbor to church. Maybe it is to give more, to trust more, to follow that dream you God has put in your heart. I have a friend named Sue. I have been friends with Sue and her husband Allen a long time. Sue was once a high powered attorney in Tampa, driving a BMW and making lots of money. She cut through cases with her sharp, brilliant mind. She was admired and sought after for her skills and talent. She did go to church on Sunday from time to time. One day she felt it. And she kept feeling it and sensing it. She hoped it would go away and it never did. It just gnawed at her. She felt that God was calling her into the ministry. She thought, No way! Ill have to give up all this money, this car, this lifestyle, this prestige. She wrestled with God. She came up with excuses. She told herself it was just her imagination. One day she relented. She left her prestigious firm, sold her BMW, said goodbye to her expensive townhouse and lifestyle and entered seminary. Where is Sue now? She has served churches with great effectiveness, and now she is a District Superintendent. And one day she just might be a Bishop. What a ministry! And it all begin with one obedient step of faith. What is God calling you to do? "
Jan-25-2015-sermon,"that. Lord knows the world has had enough of that! But it does mean that we lovingly confront those who are being irresponsible for their sake and for the sake of those they may hurt. Todays message forces us to ask two penetrating questions: Am I taking responsibility for my life? Am I willing to lovingly confront irresponsibility within my own communities? So what happened to Joshua? Well, he stopped praying and took action! He found Achans stash of gold and silver and put it back in Jericho. Achan was punished and Joshua proceeded to defeat to city of Ai. He and the Israelites moved on triumphantly. So here is what I want us to think about and act on. There may be some here who are praying a lot but doing very little. Perhaps Gods message through this story today is that it is time to get up off your knees and do something. Take responsibility for your life. God will help you but you must do your part. Stanley reminds us that there are some things we dont need to pray about. We dont need to pray about whether or not we should be faithful to our spouses. The Bible has that covered. We dont need to pray about whether or not we should steal something or whether or not we should love our enemy or serve those in need. The Bible has that covered. Or think about it this way. If you are praying hard because your irresponsibility has gotten you in a mess, maybe its time to say Amen and get up and take charge of your life. If youre praying about money problems, its time to stand up and control your spending and begin saving. If youre praying to get a job, its time to ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org stand up and start looking for one. If youre praying to get healthy, it is time to stand up and join a gym. If you desire to get closer to God, it is time to receive Christ as Savior, join the church and get involved in a Bible study. For those of you are who faced with irresponsibility in your own community, maybe it is time to take action and confront it. Students, is someone being bullied in your class? It is time to tell a teacher and be a friend to the victim. Do you have a loved one whose addiction has gotten out of hand? It is time to confront him or her, draw the line and set boundaries. Is there someone at work who is mistreating employees? It is time to stand up and address it. Is there someone in your family saying hurtful things to a loved one? It is time to confront them. Folks, prayer is essential but it is futile if it does not lead to action. We are called to love one another and sometimes loving others means taking responsibility for our lives so we dont hurt others. And sometimes it means confronting irresponsibility in others to prevent the suffering of many. As you pray today, perhaps God will say to you as he said to Joshua, Stand up! Stand up! Go and take responsibility and take action in my name. Amen. -I am grateful for Andy Stanleys message, This Is No Time to Pray! His insights were very helpful as I prepared this sermon. Pasadena Community Church JJJJJooooouuuuurrrrrnnnnneeeeey yyyyTTTTThhhhhrrrrrooooouuuuugggggh hhhhttttthhhhhe eeeeBBBBBiiiiibbbbbllllle eeee~ A Lesson from Joshua Sunday, January 25, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Scripture Lesson: Joshua This morning I continue our series Journey Through the Bible. For the next several weeks we are taking an exciting and informative journey through scripture. We will be covering the main themes and characters in the Old Testament and New Testament. In this journey we will learn how God speaks to us through scripture. The big reason for this series is the hunger I sense many of you have to know more about the Bible and the overall story of the Bible. Sometimes the church just forgets to tell the story. Most of the time when you come to church you get bits and pieces of the Bible. This series gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself in the biblical story and be transformed by it. As I have said before, this series just scratches the surface. I cant possibly do an exhaustive study of the entire Bible in ten weeks. So my hope is that these messages compel you to run home, dust off your Bible and devour it and be transformed by how God speaks to you through it. We began with a quick tour through the entire Old Testament. After that we took a closer look at Genesis and Abraham, the father of monotheism, and the foundation of the Hebrew people. We were inspired by his faith and obedience to God and learned we are blessed to be a blessing. Last week Sidney taught you about Moses and the Exodus. You learned about Moses obedience to Gods call to release his people from slavery in Egypt and the profound meaning behind the Ten Commandments. Today we are going to take a closer look at the successor of Moses  Joshua. The story of Joshuas life teaches us a critical message about responsibility. You see, the Bible does teach us to pray and wait for the Lord, and there are times for that. But the Bible also teaches us to take action and take responsibility for our lives. Have you ever heard the old saying, He is so heavenly minded that he is no earthly good! Well, Joshua teaches us not to be that way! In fact, if you are someone here who is not really religious and you find that many religious people are always hiding behind prayers and holy language but never really DO something to make a difference in this world, you are going to love this message. God calls us to be responsible for the life he has given us. So it makes sense that the message of Joshua also addresses another group of people  the enablers. Andy Stanley calls enablers those who have misguided compassion. Misguided compassion is applying compassion incorrectly. Stanley says, When you see people act irresponsibly, instead of holding them accountable, you think of all these reasons why it's okay for them to have acted that way: Well, he had a tough start; she's not as smart as everybody else in the class; he didn't come from a good home. By this kind of thinking you are actually enabling irresponsibility. Of course, todays message also touches those who are tired of being responsible for irresponsible people. You are doing the right thing and taking responsibility for your life but you continue to suffer the consequences of the irresponsible people around you. If you are tired of the unfairness of that, this message is for you too! I remember the first time I learned the definition of the word incorrigible. I was in the 6th grade. I dont ever remember hearing that word before. But one day I learned the meaning of it and would never forget it. One of my teachers was Mrs. Yost. She was a very wise lady. She was tall, confident, and had a huge heart. One day I was cutting up in class with another classmate. His name was Tom, and he was always getting into trouble. I had finished my assignment but Mrs. Yost told us if we finished early to remain quiet. Well, I didnt. Tom and I began to play paper football and were making all kinds of racket. Mrs. Yost called me to her desk and informed that because I broke the rules I would have stay after school that day for detention. I went back to my seat and waited for Mrs. Yost to call Tom to her desk. She never did! I was so angry! After the bell rang I went up to her and asked, Mrs. Yost! How come I got detention and Tom didnt? She replied, Because he is incorrigible and you are not. I replied, What? What does that mean? She said, You can look up the word during detention. So I did. During detention I grabbed a dictionary and found the incorrigible. This is what is said: Not able to be corrected, improved, or reformed. I thought, Okay, Mrs. Yost must not totally despise me. She thinks I can be reformed! However, I did feel a bit sorry for Tom. You know what? I never acted up in Mrs. Yosts class again. In fact, I came to really love and appreciate Mrs. Yost. At the end of the year she was one of my favorite teachers. I asked her to sign my yearbook and I will never forget what she wrote: Charley, it has been great having you in my class. Remember the word incorrigible and dont ever be that! Mrs. Yost confronted my irresponsible behavior, held me accountable and it made a difference! I think Mrs. Yost would like this sermon today because it is all about the importance of acting responsibly in life and not being incorrigible. For being incorrigible can have a drastic impact on our lives and the lives of those around us. We must take responsibility for our lives if we are going to become the people God wants us to be. And Joshua is going to teach us about that. So lets take a closer look at Joshua and what he can teach us. To give you a quick summary, Moses led the people out of slavery through the wilderness and just to the edge of the Jordan River and the Promised Land. He never entered it. Before he died he gave a speech and told the people to be faithful to God. When Moses died, Joshua took over as the leader of Israel. He led the Israelites across the Jordan River and into the Promised Land. When Joshua led the people of God into the Promised Land, there were 3 million of them. And it wasnt a cake walk for them to settle back into Gods home for them. There were other people living there. And these folks were pagans called the Amorites. They sacrificed children to pagan gods, abused women, and did other barbaric things. God did not want the Israelites to marry the pagans or take their cattle or their gold or silver. God did not want them to have anything to do with the pagan people. God wanted a new beginning with the Israelites. He wanted them to have a fresh start and be a pure nation untarnished by paganism and injustice. So God ordered Joshua and the Israelites to push the pagan nation out and take them over. Their first battle was the battle of Jericho. Some of you may remember that famous battle. For six days the Israelite army marched around the city. On the seventh day, they marched seven times, and then they were ordered to shout. When they did the walls of Jericho fell down. And they won the battle of Jericho by depending completely on God. But the plot thickened when they encountered the city of Ai. During the battle of Jericho a man named Achan had disobeyed God. He did not leave everything behind. He took gold and silver from the pagans and hid his treasure under his tent and didnt tell anyone about it. As Joshua led the fight on the city of Ai, he was unaware of Achans little stash. This is where we pick up the story in Joshua 7: Joshua 7:2: Now when Joshua sent men from Jericho [because they had just defeated Jericho] to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, 'Go up and spy out the region.' So the men went up and spied out Ai. When they returned to Joshua, they said, Not all the army will have to go up against Ai. In other words, they thought the battle of Ai would be easier than the battle of Jericho. They thought, This will be easy. We dont even have to use our whole army! But they were wrong. Take a look: So about three thousand went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai, who killed about 36 of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted in fear and became like water. The Israelites began to ask that question that all of us have asked at one time or another, ""Where is God? Where is God? We have suffered so much! This was supposed to be easy, and where is God? The battle of Ai was supposed to be easy but it wasnt and they lost 36 men. Lets read on: Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the Lord, remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel did the same, and sprinkled dust on their heads. And Joshua said, ""O, Sovereign Lord, why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan! Pardon your servant, Lord. What can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies? The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your own great name? Here Joshua was trying to manipulate God, Help us! Arent you embarrassed? This reflects badly on you too! Remember we represent you! And I love Gods reply to Joshua: The Lord said to Joshua, Stand up! What are you doing down on your face?"" The funny thing is God was saying to Joshua, Why are you praying to me? DO something! And Joshua was probably thinking, What? I am praying for you to DO something! Its your fault we are in this mess! But God reminds Joshua who really got them into the mess they were in: Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things [things meant to be considered as sacrifice to God], they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions. That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction. Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, ""Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: There are devoted things among you, Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you have removed them."" Who is God talking about? Who stole? Who lied? Who deceived? Achan. Here is the moral of the story. Here is the point I want you to get. Irresponsible behavior can impact an entire community. It can impact a nation, a business, a school, a neighborhood, and a family. Look at this story! Israel lost an entire battle over one mans irresponsibility. All God asked was that the people leave behind the gold and silver of the pagans. But Achan could not resist his greed. He gave in, took the gold and silver, and the entire nation of Israel suffered the consequences. I know the story seems ridiculous as we read it today. Really? That does not seem fair! One man screws up and a whole nation pays for it! That is not right! You are correct! Its not right, but it happens. Why? Because we are all connected and our words and actions have a ripple effect on everyone around us. When a spouse commits adultery or has an addiction, who suffers? The other spouse, the kids, and possibly friends. When parents are irresponsible, who suffers? The children. When someone in a business steals from that business, who suffers? Everyone in that business. When a church goes through a scandal because of irresponsible leaders or members, the entire church is torn apart. Look at the recession we went through! We can analyze it to death, but one thing we can all agree on is that it taught us that the financial irresponsibility of a few caused the entire nation to suffer. So what are we supposed to do? Confront irresponsibility. Now that sounds rather aggressive and unloving, doesnt it? But when we really look at it, it is the most loving and Christian thing we can do. What is loving? Allowing irresponsibility to negatively impact the lives of many or standing up to it and sparing others from suffering and pain? Read the Prophets. They are always confronting irresponsibility. Read the gospels. Jesus was constantly calling out those whose irresponsible behavior was impacting people. Look at the life of MLK. Think of how many lives he changed because he had the courage to confront the people who were acting irresponsibly toward those whose skin was a different color? Now this doesnt mean we go around acting like a bunch of zealots with hatred in our eyes and poison in our words. This doesnt mean we have a license to be judgmental. Jesus warned us about "
Jan-4-2015-sermon,"they didnt. They were there before the exile and after the exile. They were there when they returned to their homeland and things were comfortable. They would not let them forget about God and his promises. So what is Gods word for us in this? Did you just come for a lecture? Well, God still speaks to us through the Old Testament because the Old Testament story is our story too! In Genesis we find Gods final act of creation was creating us. We are created in Gods image! We are created to be recipients of Gods love and to love God back and love others. Take a look at Deuteronomy 6:45:Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. The story of the Bible says we were created out of love to give love in return. But when we reject God and his love things dont go well. We are not whole. God has given us free will and we struggle with it. Do we choose God or do we not choose God? That is the story of the Bible and it is our story too. Couldnt you resonate with the people of Israel? They struggled with this throughout their history. But the underlying theme of the Old Testament is through all this God continues to take Israel back, and by his grace, he continues to take us back. I want to end by reading a portion of the book of Hosea, chapter 11. Feel Gods love and compassion for Israel being expressed: When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. But the more they were called, the more they went away from me. They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images. It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them. I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. To them I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek, and I bent down to feed them. How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboyim? My heart is changed within me; all my compassion is aroused. We all make mistakes. We all make the wrong choices. In our failures, we discover that life without God never satisfies. But the amazing thing is God always takes us back. That is the story of the Old Testament and it our story. Thanks be to God. Amen. ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org Pasadena Community Church JJJJJooooouuuuurrrrrnnnnneeeeey yyyyTTTTThhhhhrrrrrooooouuuuugggggh hhhhttttthhhhhe eeeeBBBBBiiiiibbbbbllllle eeee~ The Old Testament in 30 Minutes Sunday, January 4, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today I begin a new sermon series called Journey Through the Bible. The sermon series is largely based upon a Bible study I did last year on both the Old Testament and New Testament. I enjoyed doing the Bible study but I was not prepared for the response I received. What I learned from teaching that Bible study is that there is an overwhelming hunger out there for people to learn more about the Bible. I also discovered that people want to learn more about the Bible but often they are afraid to admit that they don't know much about the Bible. They desire a safe, non intimidating space to learn more and ask questions and have a good time doing it. So since that Bible study really scratched an itch for several people I thought it would be a good idea to do a sermon series on this very study. I imagine there are many more people who come to worship on Sunday who really want to learn more about the Bible too! Obviously, one of the main purposes of this series is to help us all learn more about the most important book history and the best-selling book of all time. And I hope that as you learn more about the Bible you will feel compelled to go home and read your Bible and grow in your faith as a result. I also know there may be folks in worship today who have come out of curiosity. You saw the post card we mailed out about this series and you want to learn more about this Bible that everyone talks about. You may not consider yourself a Christian or religious but you just want to learn more. Well, I am glad you are here and I hope you feel welcome here. I also hope this will be a learning experience for you as well. The second purpose of this series really follows the first. You might be surprised to know that a very small percentage of Christians really know the Bible. In fact there have been some polls done over the last few years that are rather staggering. A Pew research study done in 2010 in America found that evangelical Christians knowledge of the New Testament is only a smidgen higher than most atheists. The Barna Group, a Christian research organization, found in 2012 that most evangelicals in America have attitudes and beliefs that are more in line with the Pharisees, the religious leaders who often opposed the teachings of Jesus. The bottom line, which may be difficult for many to accept and face, is that even though Americans and Christians revere the Bible many of them don't read it and they dont know what is in it. Of course because there are so many Christians who don't read and understand the Bible it is going to be misunderstood and misinterpreted. So in this series my hope is that as we journey through the Bible and learn its main themes and characters we will learn how God speaks to us through the Bible and why this book is so important. It is only through understanding the Bible and who put it together that we can comprehend what historys most important book says and, just as important, what it does not say. So for the next few weeks we're going to walk through the entire Bible and listen to what God wants to say to us through it. Now I know today's title is interesting. I know some of your thinking, Is he really going to cover the entire Old Testament in 30 minutes? Well the answer to that is that I'm going to try. And of course, as you can see, I'm going to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time, so get ready! I think you can handle it! You ready to impress your friends with all of your knowledge of the Old Testament? Lets get started. Today I want to give you the Cliff Notes version of the Old Testament  a broad sweep of it and cover all the books and their major themes and characters. What I have learned is that most of the time you just get bits and pieces of the Bible. Rarely do you just get to hear the entire story at one time. So this morning just allow the Old Testament story to sweep over you and experience it. I want to start off this morning by saying that the Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible) is really the book that shaped Jesus life and the life of the early church. Their Bible was the Old Testament. A great example of this is when Jesus was tempted in the desert. How did he respond to temptation? He responded to temptation by quoting the Old Testament. And when Jesus was on the cross he prayed the Old Testament. He prayed Psalm 22, My God, My God why have you forsaken me? And then as we look at the New Testament Epistles we find the Apostle Paul telling us in 2nd Timothy that All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for building up the church. The scripture he was referring to was the Old Testament. The Old Testament contains 39 books and covers about 1400 years  1800-432B.C. The Old Testament can be broken down into three sections: The Historical Books (17), which contain the story of the Hebrew people; The Poetic Books (5), containing the wisdom learned by the Hebrew people throughout their history; The Prophetic Books (17), which give warnings in various stages of Israel's history. We begin, of course, with the book of Genesis. Genesis begins with the poetic account of God creating the world. Later, we are introduced to Abraham and his wife Sarah. The story of the Bible is about the descendants of Abraham and Sarah. Abraham and Sarah were up in years and never had any children. Yet God made a promise with Abraham that if he would stay faithful, God would bless him with as many descendants as there are stars in the sky. So Abraham was faithful to God and God blessed him with children. Abraham had a child with his handmaiden and named him Ishmael. And, of course, Abraham had a child with Sarah and his name was Isaac. The Old Testament covers the descendants of Isaac because after Isaac we have Jacob and Esau. Jacob means Israel, which means one who struggles with God. So Jacobs descendants became known as Israelites. Fast forward many years later and we find that the Israelites experienced a great famine in the land of Canaan. So they migrated out of Canaan through the Euphrates River for food and resources. They settled in the area of Goshen. And I want to you to see a map that shows their journey to Goshen. When they settled in Goshen they found some very nice people called Hyksos who welcomed the Israelites. Later, however, the Egyptians would come along and overthrow the Hyksos and make the Israelites their slaves for four hundred years. Now we turn our attention to the book of Exodus and we find that in 1290 B.C. God called a man by the name of Moses to save his people. Moses was an 80 year old goat herder from the Sinai Peninsula. Moses confronted Pharaoh and told him to release the Hebrew people but Pharaoh did not relent. God then sent plagues down on Egypt which persuaded Pharaoh to release the Hebrew people! Moses led the Israelites through the Red Sea to freedom. However, the Israelites would wander in the wilderness for 40 years before they would reach the Promised Land. They could've gotten there a lot quicker but they, like many of us, were slow learners when it came to being faithful to God. So it was while they were wandering in the desert that God gave Moses the 10 Commandments and made a Covenant with Moses which included 613 laws. Fast-forward forty years and we find that Moses brought the Israelites just to the edge of the Promised Land. Some of you know Moses did not get to enter the Promised Land with the Israelites. He gave a powerful speech reminding the Israelites to be faithful to God and then Moses died. That's when Joshua took over and led the people of God into the land of Canaan. They conquered Canaan and lived in the Promised Land. The books Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy recount the period the Jews were delivered from Egypt and entered the Promised Land. We add Genesis to that list and we get what is called the Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament. Torah means Law. Now we turn our attention to the books of Joshua and Judges. These two books tell the interesting story of the 200 year history of the Israelites living in Canaan. Sadly, during this time they would forget God. They would be attacked by enemies and then, of course, the people of God would cry out for help and God would send warriors known as Judges. The Judges were there to remind people to follow God and to do what was right. The people of God would do that for a while and then they would forget God again and get attacked. They would cry out and God would send more judges. This went on for about 200 years. After about 200 years the people finally told Samuel, the last judge, that they wanted a king to rule over them. Samuel said they didn't need a king but the people of God insisted. So God gave them Saul who ruled between 1050 and 1010 B.C. After King Saul came the greatest King of Israel, King David. After King David was King Solomon who came to power in 970 B.C. During the course of his reign he constructed a great temple where the people of God would worship for 400 years. The books Ruth, 1st and 2nd Samuel, and 1st and 2nd Chronicles tell the story of the great monarchy, especially of King David and King Solomon. In 1st and 2nd Kings the plot thickens with the story of Israel. King Solomons son Rehoboam was not a very good king. He came to power in 930 B.C. and he wanted to rule with an iron fist. So the people of Israel rebelled against this king and the people of God were split into two camps  Israel was in the north and Judah was in the south. Here is a map of that split. The bottom line is that the split didn't end well for either camp. Most of the Kings they had over the years were terrible. They worshipped other gods and were corrupted by power. They forgot about the weak suppressed among them. It was during this time that God rose up Prophets to be the conscience of the people of God. The prophets were there to remind them that God was the source of their blessings and if they turned away from God they would be susceptible to being destroyed by other kingdoms. Well, that's exactly what happened. The people of God rebelled against God and both camps, Judah and Israel, were attacked by other kingdoms. The Assyrians in 722 B.C. took over Israel in the north and intermarried with them. Later, the southern tribe of Judah was conquered by the Babylonians. To be fair, when the people of Judah were exiled they did remain faithful to God. They humbled themselves before God and created places of worship in the midst of their exile. They remembered who they were and whose they were and God honored that. On 538 B.C. the Babylonians were conquered by the Persians. Cyrus the Persian allowed the Jews to go back to their homeland. So 50,000 Jews traveled back to their homeland and the books Ezra and Nehemiah tell the story of their journey back to their homeland. They found Jerusalem in ruins and they rebuilt the city walls and the Temple. The book of Esther tells the beautiful story of the Jewish woman Esther who was married to the King of Persia. Esther persuaded the King of Persia not to annihilate the Jewish people but to allow them to be free. The Jewish people, to this day, owe their survival to Esther. Of course in about 100 years the people of God would get too comfortable again and they would forget about God. Malachi, the final prophet and the last book of the Old Testament, would warn them once again. Malachi told them that they were not giving God their heart. He called them to repent and remember what happened to their ancestors. He warned them that if they did not repent that if they did not turn back to God what happened to their ancestors would happen to them. And there you have, in a nutshell, the story of the Old Testament  1400 years of history. Each book in the Old Testament is rooted in the history that I just described. For example, the poetic books intersect with this history in a powerful way. The book of Job wrestles with the problem of evil and suffering. The book of Psalms contains the prayers and songs written across the course of history from the time of David until after the exile. Basically Psalms was the hymnbook of the people of Israel. The book of Proverbs contains pity sayings about how life works written by Solomon and the people who came after him. Ecclesiastes, which is attributed to Solomon, reveals Solomon reflecting at the end of his life, struggling with the meaning of life. He comes to the conclusion that all of life is empty except our relationship with God. And then Song of Songs is a very interesting book about erotic love and God's blessings on human intimacy and sex. And then we have the Prophets. From Isaiah to Malachi, the Prophets were the conscience of the people of God, and as we will learn in this series, our conscience too. The Prophets were always there throughout Israels history to warn them to follow God or they would be destroyed. They were there before Israel and Judah were conquered to warn them and they were there afterwards. They were there to give them hope about their future if they obeyed God and to warn them about their future if "

The worst thing the flyer can do is try to catch the catcher. Im not supposed to catch Joe.

In this series we are taking a look at common platitudes of faith. Sometimes we see them on bumper stickers. Sometimes we hear them from well meaning family members or friends. And perhaps some of you may say these phrases to others. Quite often these popular phrases of faith are casually said without really thinking through what they mean. In fact, some folks think these phrases come straight from the Bible when they are nowhere to be found in scripture. So we are going to take a closer look at these popular phrases of faith and test them with scripture. My hope is that this series will encourage us to think deeper about our faith. I also hope it will help us think biblically about some of the popular theology in our culture. The truth is a lot of the popular clichs of faith that we hear are not biblical. But most clichs suffer from having the wrong home. People are surprised to find that at no time in the movie Casablanca does Rick ever say, Play it again, Sam. It is also surprising to know that in over 79 Star Trek episodes and 6 movies, no one ever actually says, Beam me up, Scotty. But quite often people make wrong assumptions about the sources of many clichs. It works the same with the Bible. There are all kinds of things that people assume the Bible says but it actually doesnt. We are looking at a few in this series. Last week we looked at a popular one: God helps those who help themselves. Over 80% of Christians believe that quote is from the Bible. Well, its not. And if you want to learn why that phrase is untrue listen to last weeks message. Today we take a look at another faith clich that many people think comes from the Bible: God never gives you more than you can handle. Well meaning folks often say this to others in the time of stress or suffering. Maybe someone has said this to you: Dont worry. God wont give you more than you can handle. In other words, Everything will be alright. God wouldnt have given you this trial if you couldnt get through it. I cringe when I hear people say that. I know people are trying to be helpful but it really sounds like a taunt, like we are not measuring up in life. Lets be honest. When we hear that we feel less than because we think we should be able to handle our pain and suffering. Something must be wrong with me. If I was a good Christian I would be able to handle this. Why cant I handle it? People intending to encourage us with this clich really end up discouraging us. Whats worse is that this phrase can cause us to ignore our suffering and pain and believe that we can handle everything ourselves! And thats just unhealthy and the opposite of what our faith teaches us. The bottom line is that the Bible never says that God will never give you more than you can handle. Its not in there because it is not true. The truth is there will be times in life when you will feel like you cant handle what life is throwing at you. Thats normal because we cant make it on our own! Could you imagine saying to an inmate at Auschwitz, Dont worry; God never gives you more than you can handle? Or what about a woman whose children are killed in a car accident or someone who has just been diagnosed with cancer or someone who is suffering from depression or an anxiety disorder? Like a friend of mine likes to say about this tired old phrase, Those who have suffered nervous breakdowns didnt get the memo that God never gives you more than you can handle. So if this phrase does not come from the Bible then where does it come from? Well, I know some of you will be shocked to hear that more than likely this phrase comes from folks who have misunderstood the Bible and taken scripture out of context. People who use this phrase will often mistakenly point to a passage in 1st Corinthians: No temptation has seized you that isnt common for people. But God is faithful. He wont allow you to be tempted beyond your abilities. Instead, with the temptation, God will also supply a way out so that you will be able to endure it. -1st Corinthians 10:13 Paul is talking about temptation here, not suffering, pain, tragedy or burdens. Hes basically saying that we will never face a temptation we cannot resist. God will always give us strength to resist temptation. But that is a far cry from saying that we will never suffer a burden that we cant handle on your own. In fact, the Bible tells us the exact opposite! The Bible tells us that we will suffer burdens in life that we cant handle on our own. Take a look at something else Paul says in 2nd Corinthians: Brothers and sisters, we dont want you to be unaware of the troubles that we went through in Asia. We were weighed down with a load of suffering that was so far beyond our strength that we were afraid we might not survive. -2 Corinthians 1:8 I dont hear Paul saying, God will never give you more than you can handle in that verse, do you? Or what about these verses from the book of Psalms: Im worn out, completely crushed; I groan because of my miserable heart. Psalm 38:8 My wrongdoings are stacked higher than my head; they are a weight thats way too heavy for me. Psalm 38:4 Or what about what the angel had to say to the prophet Elijah: Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you. -1 Kings 19:7 Throughout the Bible we find people who suffered burdens that were overwhelming and too much for them to handle on their own. This phrase is untrue, unbiblical and can be extremely cruel. In one online forum, another pastor was taking on this exact belief and challenging it as bad theology. In the comments section of that post was the following: I have been having a very hard time with that scripture and feeling like a failure as a Christian because I felt like I am not strong enough. I lost my sister to cancer and then my baby sister in a wreck and this June I lost my oldest child and everyone kept saying God would not put more on me than I could bear. Tonight I decided to start searching to see if it was scripture and I know that God led me to your page and it has helped to take away the guilt of feeling like a bad Christian because I am having such a hard time dealing with the loss of my child. It is cruel to tell those who suffer that God will never give you more than you can handle. All it does is compound their suffering with more suffering because the only conclusion they can make is that they are to blame. They think, I must have done something wrong! Because if God would not give me this burden unless I could bear it, then it is my fault I am overwhelmed and hurt. I should be able to handle this! So folks dont ever say this to people. If you have said it, please stop saying it. And those of you who have been told this and your faith is broken because of it, please hear this: God did not give you your pain and suffering. God loves you and would never do that. I also want you to know that you are not supposed to handle life on your own. Thats why all of us need God. The problem with the phrase God will never give you more than you can handle is not only is it wrong theologically but it is a self centered statement. Its all about what you can handle. And guess what? Its not about you! Its not about me! Its not about us! This is the very point Paul makes in 2nd Corinthians and it is a critical point. In the passage I read earlier Paul talked about how they were weighted down with a load of sufferings that was so far beyond their strength that they were afraid they might not survive. Well, in the following verse Paul gives us the most important thing for us to remember when we are overwhelmed by burdens in life. Take a look: It certainly seemed to us as if we had gotten the death penalty. This was so that we would have confidence in God, who raises the dead, instead of ourselves. -2 Corinthians 1:9 Paul thought he was finished. Dead. Done. Gone. He knew he couldnt handle the trials he was facing because it was beyond his strength. In the midst of being overwhelmed it occurred to him that he should have confidence in God and not in himself. So basically Paul is telling us that when we suffer in life it is not a test from God of how much we can bear. Instead, when we suffer we encounter God and learn to depend on Him. This is why the cross is so important, and not only an empty cross. Yes, an empty cross is important in reminding us of the resurrection but sometimes when we are overwhelmed by life we need to see a cross with Jesus suffering on it. We need to see a cross with our God in the flesh suffering from shame, pain, exhaustion, humiliation, and injustice. When we see a crucifix it reminds us that when we suffer, when we are in pain, when we are humiliated, when we are overwhelmed, we find God right in there with us, suffering with us. We have a God who is with us and who understands and who bears our suffering with us. So if you are suffering today God is there for you and he wants to help you carry your burdens and share your suffering and give you strength and power to get through it. Jesus gives us this invitation: Come to me, all you who are struggling hard and carrying heavy loads, and I will give you rest. Put on my yoke, and learn from me. Im gentle and humble. And you will find rest for yourselves. My yoke is easy to bear, and my burden is light. Matthew 11:28-30 We demonstrate our faith by admitting we cant handle life on our own and trusting God to help us carry our burdens. C.S. Lewis said, All genuine religious conversions are blessed defeats. And by that he meant that we dont truly have faith until we figure out that we cant handle life by ourselves and realize that the only wise thing to do is to surrender our lives to God and his power and strength. Here is a verse of scripture that makes it real clear: Cast all your anxiety on him because he -1st cares for you. Peter 5:7 Todays message comes down to this: When we are faced with more than we can handle, we can rest in the reality that God can handle it. So are you faced with more than you can handle today? Are you overwhelmed by life? Have you been trying to carry your burdens on your own or have you given it to God? Have you tried to fake it until you make it or have you surrendered it to God? Sometimes we find that God helps us carry our burdens and anxieties through his people, the body of Christ! Thats right. Thats one of the big reasons why we need the church, why we need each other. The church is not an individualistic enterprise. The church is not a community of self centered people. The church is the antithesis of that! The church should be a place where you can come and say, I cant handle life on my own strength and I need help! The church should be a place where we are surrounded by a community of loving and merciful people who will bear our burdens with us. You see when someone who is suffering and overwhelmed by life comes to the church, we, as the church, are called to put flesh and bone on the person of Jesus and his promise to bear our burdens and help us carry the load. The church is living proof that God suffers with us and we can depend on him. Paul puts it this way: Carry each others burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. Galatians 6:2 The late great spiritual writer Henri Nouwen received the greatest revelation about faith at, of all places, the circus! Nouwen went to see the German trapeze group, The Flying Rodleighs perform. He was mesmerized by their breathtaking performance as they flew gracefully through the air. At the end of the show, he spoke with the leader of the troupe, Rodleigh himself. Nouwen asked him how he was able to perform with such grace and ease so high in the air. Rodleigh responded, The public might think that I am the great star of the trapeze, but the real star is Joe, my catcherThe secret is that the flyer does nothing "
July-19-2015-sermon,"that settles it we should say, The Bible said it, Im going to take it seriously and I am going to study it in light of what Jesus taught us. The mistake many Christians make is thinking that the Bible is the Word of God. No, Jesus is the Word of God. The Bible reveals the Word of God, who is Jesus. The first chapter of the gospel of John explains it beautifully: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankindThe Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. John 1:1-4, 14 God wrapped his message, love and character and will in the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the infallible Word of God. So, therefore, Jesus is the lens through which we read the Bible. For example, when I read in the Old Testament that if a priests daughter becomes a prostitute, she is to be bound and burned alive by her father, I dont say, God said it, I believe it, that settles it. I say, No, Jesus was a friend to prostitutes and loved them and taught them and therefore I should treat them as Jesus treated them. When I read in the Bible that God commanded 42,000 foreign men and women to be killed in one day I dont say, God said it, I believe it, that settles it. Instead, I say, Jesus said to loves our enemies. Killing doesnt capture heart and character of God. When all else fails I remember that love is the highest law. Jesus said so. He said the law could be summed up this way: Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, soul, mind, and strength and your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:37-39). At the end of the day the Bible is not meant to be debated; it is meant to be read. God breathes on us when we read it. God guides us and feeds us and empowers us through the same ideas that inspired Abraham, Moses, the Prophets, the disciples and Paul. When I think of Abraham and Sarah and how God blessed them with a child in their old age I think of a couple who told me that they had prayed and prayed to have a child and they thought it wasnt to be. They reread the story of Abraham and Sarah and had faith. One day they got the news! They were pregnant! I read about King David and think of people who come to see me who feel they have done too many bad things. They think they are of no use to God. And then I tell them the story of David and they light up! They have hope! I think of being at the bed side of someone who is sick and providing comfort and strength by saying, The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I think of little children who run around saying and doing the craziest and yet the wisest things and I think of Jesus words, Unless you can become like a child you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven. I think of the values of this world and how they often get confused with the values of God and I remember Jesus words, The last shall be first and the first shall be last.He who would be great in the Kingdom must be a servant. When I am anxious I read, Be still and know that I am God. When I am mess up and hurt others, I remember, Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way. Read the Bible. If you have never read it, give it a try. Ask God to help you read it and get a good commentary. Just try it and see. What do you have to lose? As someone once said, The Bible doesnt just increase knowledge; it changes lives. The Bible doesnt just talk about us; it talks to us. The Bible brings us back to our senses. Amen. Pasadena Community Church Bumper Sticker Theology ~ God Said It, I Believe It, That Settles It? ~ Sunday, July 19, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today I continue our series called Bumper Sticker Theology. In this series we are taking a look at common platitudes of faith. Sometimes we see them on bumper stickers. Sometimes we hear them from well meaning family members or friends. And perhaps some of you may say these phrases to others. Quite often these popular phrases of faith are casually said without really thinking through what they mean. In fact, some folks think these phrases come straight from the Bible when they are nowhere to be found in scripture. So we are going to take a closer look at these popular phrases of faith and test them with scripture. My hope is that this series will encourage us to think deeper about our faith. I also hope it will help us think biblically about some of the popular theology in our culture. Today, we are taking a look at another common clich of faith. Lets say it together, God said, I believe it, that settles it! Or some simply say, God said it, that settles it! I am grateful to Adam Hamilton and his message on this clich and his book, Making Sense of the Bible. His insights were helpful as I prepared this message. Hamilton reminds us, of course, that when make this statement they are referring to the Bible. The Bible said it, I believe it, that settles it. It sounds true and right, doesnt it? It feels good to say it sometimes. We believe what the Bible says. We dont question it. We dont waver on it. No argument, end of story. Right? That sounds good and right and virtuous. But honestly, we dont read or apply scripture that way. That statement does not reflect the way most of us use the Bible in our lives. Its more complicated than that. For example, if you hold to this militant understanding of the Bible, then you can never get a tattoo. Men, you can never get a haircut and you must grow out your beards. You cant wear clothes with mixed fibers. You cant eat shrimp, bacon, BBQ Ribs, a ham sandwich, or a chili dog. And you can never throw a football. Why? Because the Bible says all of those things are unclean and against the law. Take a look at this peculiar passage of scripture in Deuteronomy 23: Designate a place outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself. As part of your equipment have something to dig with, and when you relieve yourself, dig a hole and cover up your excrement. For the LORD your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy, so that he will not see among you anything indecent and turn away from you. Deuteronomy 23:12-14 I am sure you have never heard a sermon on that text have you?! And I am sure you never will again! God said it, I believe it, that settles it? Really? Whats interesting is that this text was widely used in the church back in the 1880s because indoor plumbing was about to be introduced. And, of course, there were many in the church who thought it would be great and they advocated for it. But those who took the view of God said it, I believe it, that settles it, cited this text and demanded keeping outhouses and forbidding bathrooms inside the church. They feared God would be offended and not protect them if they went to the bathroom inside the church. God said it, I believe it, that settles it! Really? Most of us dont read, apply or use the Bible this way. And, if we are honest, we dont want to! Take a look at this text from Leviticus: Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death. Because they have cursed ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org their father or mother, their blood will be on their own head. Leviticus 20:9 Or what about this one? Any of you work yesterday? Whoever works on the Sabbath shall be put to death. Exodus 35:2 In fact, there is a moment in scripture when Moses sees a man looking for firewood on the Sabbath. When Moses asked God, What should I do? God told Moses to execute him. In Deuteronomy 22 it says that if a man marries a woman who is not a virgin, the following should occur: She shall be brought to the door of her fathers house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. Deuteronomy 22:21 God said it, I believe it, that settles it? I dont think so. In the mid 1800s most southern preachers supported slavery. And you know how they did it? By pointing to over 220 verses in the Bible that support slavery. For example in Exodus 21 we read: Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property. Exodus 21:20-21 Of course, in the New Testament we also find verses that support slavery. In fact, historians have discovered that over half of the pro slavery literature written before the Civil War was written by pastors. These pastors often cited scripture to back up their position. Many of you have seen the movie 12 Years a Slave. Its a powerful movie that I recommend to you. In the movie there is a scene where a slave is about to be beaten and the slave owner quotes from Luke 12 before he beats her: The servant who knows the masters will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. Luke 12:47 God said it, I believe it, that settles it? Really? Lets move from the issue of slavery to the role of women in the Bible. In 1st Timothy we read: I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or -1st expensive clothes. Timothy 2:9 I guess we are not allowed to have jewelry in church. So I have spoken with all of the ushers and have asked them to come forward and pass the plate so you can put all of your rings, gold and jewelry in there. It will really help us with our capital campaign! Of course, the Apostle Paul has not been a favorite Christian figure for many women. Look at what he says in 1st Corinthians 14: Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. -1st Corinthians 14:34-35 Paul also said in 1st Timothy: A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. -1st Timothy 2:11-12 Clearly, Paul was never married or he would have never said these things! God said it, I believe it, that settles it? What do we say about Paul? Was he just a male chauvinist? Was he really inspired? Well, Paul was inspired but he was also a product of the time in which he lived. When Paul wrote these words, women had no rights, no property and no source of income. Now, if Paul were writing today I think his words about women would be a lot different. But we cant hold Paul who lived in the first century to the same standards of our time where we have progressed in seeing that male and female are equal. The good news is that in the gospels we find that Jesus treated women as equal. He broke many taboos when it came to the role of women. He ministered to them and called them as disciples. In fact, the first evangelists in the gospels were women! Unfortunately, many churches do not interpret Pauls texts in light of the gospel and our context today. They still hold to a literal understanding of Pauls words. So you will often find churches in our community where women cant hold leadership positions. They cant teach or preach and must be submissive to men. I am glad that we are part of a denomination that doesnt interpret Pauls words this way. The United Methodist Church has always been a forerunner in lifting up the rights of women in society and ministry. We were one of the first denominations to ordained women as ministers. God said it, I believe it, that settles it is over simplistic and does not reflect how we read and apply scripture. So, how do we or how should we read, interpret and apply scripture responsibly as Christians? I dont believe that God dictated his words through an angel to the writers of the Bible. Its not like they were put in some trance and God forced their hands to write exactly what God wanted. Instead, most Christians believe that God inspired the writers of the Bible within their own humanity and frame of reference. They wrote in light of their cultural setting, their limited understanding of science, and their biases and perspective. God moved them within their own context. Throughout the years this has been churchs way of seeing the inspiration of the Bible. The Hebrew people and the early church would have never held to the view of God said it, I believe it, that settles it. In fact, Jesus, Paul, and the Apostles knew the Bible needed to be interpreted and applied in new ways. When referencing the Law, Jesus would often say, You have heard it was said, but I say unto you Paul didnt feel that God cared whether or not Gentile Christian men got circumcised even though that was a strict law since Abraham. In Acts 15 we read about the Apostles agreeing that new Christians are not required to adhere to much of the old Law. They all knew the Bible needed to be reinterpreted and reapplied in new ways as the world changed and progressed. To say the Bible is inspired means the Bible is a living and breathing document that contains God inspired ideas that continue to inspire. Thats what the Bible says about itself in 2nd Timothy 3:16-17, All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good work. The word inspired in this verse means, God breathed. God did not force or coerce the writers of the Bible; God breathed on them. Gods divinity moved within their humanity to show us who he is and who he wants us to be. Biblical writers were indeed inspired, but they were also human. They had frailties and limitations. They had their own frame of reference. They wrote in a pre-scientific age. They were limited by their own historical context. But their humanity does not negate their inspiration. In fact, it supports it. Luther said the Bible is the manger which carries the Christ. The Bible shows that God chose to reveal himself in the messiness of humanity. The Bible is human and divine, just like Jesus. And that is a beautiful expression of God. This view shows the dynamic quality of Gods inspiration  that the words of the Bible are not dictated words stuck in the past; they are human words that contain God inspired ideas that moved people in the past and still move people today! The Bible is made up of many different parts. There is poetry, history, law, gospel, stories, narratives. There is a richness to the Bible which requires receiving it in a variety of ways. Appreciating the Bible means interpreting the Bible. The style of literature used and the context of the passage determine how we receive the Bible. This seems so simple, but it is amazing how many Christians dont interpret the Bible this way. Instead, some Christians see the Bible as a mathematical text book that contains facts that cant be questioned. Viewing the Bible this way limits how the Bible can transform us. Take the four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Each of these gospels shed a different light on Jesus. Each gospel writer had a different experience of Jesus and chose to focus on specific aspects of his life and ministry. Does this negate the ministry of Jesus or somehow diminish the credibility of the gospel writers? No! They experienced Jesus in different ways, just like each one of us. The Bible becomes true as it becomes true in our own lives. The Bible is true in so far as it we personally encounter its truth. The living word of God connects with us as we are willing to be open to its truth. The Bible was not inspired to be a book of facts; it is inspired to be a book of truth. There is a big difference. Everyone can receive facts, but not everyone is open to truth. In order for the Bible to be true for me or you or anyone, we must bring one thing to the reading of it  faith. We must be willing to allow the Holy Spirit to guide our reading of it. We dont worship the Bible; we worship the God of the Bible. The Bible points to God. Until you have faith the Bible will have no meaning. But once you surrender your life to God, the Bible becomes a living and breathing book where you encounter God. It becomes a profound account of how God has related to the world throughout history and how God will relate to you today. It becomes a mirror where you see yourself and a light showing where you need to be. It becomes God-breathed for you. So what does this mean on a practical level? Well, instead of saying, God, said it, I believe it "
July-26-2015-sermon,"about ways we are unkind, uncharitable, unforgiving, unloving, and unmerciful. Those are our deepest, most damaging sins. They are certainly mine and we need to correct them. Jesus said, By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. John 13:35 Jesus said that people will know we are his followers, not by our hatred, not by our judgmentalism, not by our pride, not by our interpretation of scripture, but by our LOVE for one another. You know what this means? This means that we have been released from judgment. Our job, our call, our duty, our orders are to love everyone  to reach out to the marginalized, and homosexuals have been marginalized in society. Love is the highest law! Now, let me ask you something. Can you imagine how much energy the church would save and could use for better purposes by embracing Jesus call to release judgment and love the world? Imagine all the energy that is wasted when Christians have crusades against something. Imagine saving that energy and using it for ministries and causes that infuse the world with the love of Jesus! Ill tell you what I believe and this comes straight from the testimony of scripture. If the church spent as much energy taking care of the poor and widows as we do on justifying prejudice the world would be a different place. If the church spent as much time loving the least, last and lost as we do on crusades against something the world would be a different place. If the church spent as much time bringing healing and compassion to those who are suffering as we do on debating the interpretation of scripture the world would be a different place. Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Martin Thielen writes about a minister he knew who officiated at a funeral for a man who died of AIDS. He writes, Several other pastors in town refused to handle the funeral because the man was gay and because those attending the funeral would also be gay. About thirty homosexual men showed up for the graveside funeral. The minister conducted the service the best he could. He then said the closing prayer and gave the blessing, but the men did not move. He motioned them to leave, but they wouldnt. Finally, the minister said, Is there anything more I can do for you? One of them said, Yeah, they usually read the 23rd Psalm at these things. Would you mind reading it? He did. Then someone said, Isnt there something in the Bible about nothing separating us from the love of God? Can you read that? He read Romans 8. Then one of the men said, Could you read that passage about God raising us up on eagles wings? And he turned to Isaiah 40 and read it. This went on and on. These men desperately wanted to hear the word of God, to know Gods love and to have spiritual connections in their lives. They were starving for God. Many of them had been raised in the church and still loved God. However, because of their sexual orientation, many Christians told them they were deviant, hated by God and unwanted at church. Harsh judgment from Christians had pushed them away from God and church. You know what I worry about? I worry about God thinks about his followers when their behavior pushes others away from knowing and experiencing his love and grace. I worry a lot about that. The Bible is real clear. In 2nd Corinthians it says we are to be the aroma of Christ  the sweet fragrance of life to everyone we come across. But Jesus was even clearer. He didnt mess around with poetic language. He simply said that the world will know we follow him when we love one another.

In this series we have taken a look at common platitudes of faith. Sometimes we see them on bumper stickers. Sometimes we hear them from well meaning family members or friends. And perhaps some of you may say these phrases to others. Quite often these popular phrases of faith are casually said without really thinking through what they mean. In fact, some folks think these phrases come straight from the Bible when they are nowhere to be found in scripture. So we have taken a closer look at these popular phrases of faith and tested them with scripture and Christian tradition. My hope is that this series has encouraged us to think deeper about our faith. I also hope it has helped us think biblically about some of the popular theology in our culture. The first week we explored the phrase, Everything happens for a reason. We learned thats not true. Often times things happen because people choose to do foolish things! Everything that happens to you is not Gods will, but God has a will in everything that happens to you. God can redeem your suffering and do something good with it. Next we looked at the phrase, The Lord helps those who help themselves. We discovered that the gospel message goes in the opposite direction. The Lord does help those who cant help themselves. Thats what grace is all about. Then we looked at the phrase, God will never give you more than you can handle. Not true. We will face events in life that we cant handle on our own and they are not from God. But God can help us handle them. Our confidence is in God and not in ourselves. Last week we explored the often quoted phrase, God said it, I believe it, that settles it. We learned that when it comes to interpreting the Bible its not always that simple. The Bible must be interpreted and applied to our context today. We must interpret scripture through the lens of what Jesus has taught us. We conclude this series today with what I think is the most popular faith clich of our time: Love the sinner, hate the sin. We hear it thrown around a lot in Christian circles today as controversial issues are discussed. This statement is popular because it is a rather convenient and safe way of passing judgment on the sins or behavior of others. Christians disagree with the sin or behavior of another and want to call it out but they still want to appear loving and so they say, I love the sinner but I hate the sin. In theory this sounds good and virtuous. We can have the best of both worlds. I can love people that I judge and still have integrity with disagreeing with their sin. But see thats the problem. Most of us only see this phrase from the perspective of the one saying it and not the one receiving it. And the fact is all of us are sinners! Lets get real folks. Nobody can hold to this principle. No one can hold this distinction. Its been my experience that when someone tries to hold to this principle they just wind up hating the sinner. I have never known a person in my life who said, You know, my Christian friend hates my sin, but I know she really loves me. Honestly, this phrase is hate dressed up really pretty. This phrase is for those who have been seduced into thinking that compassion is weakness and a hard heart is moral discernment. I have a colleague who had someone call him late one night who was thinking about committing suicide. He struggled with depression and addiction and had been divorced twice. He grew up in a ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org conservative church and made the mistake of airing his sins to the church. He was rebuked and shunned from the community. As he talked to my colleague, he said, You know, I heard a lot about love from Christians but I never felt it. I heard it preached on a lot but I never saw it. The only thing I saw and felt was hate. He went on to say, I have hungered and sought after love my whole life and have never found it. I thought I would find it in the church. I was wrong. If I cant experience love from the very people in the world who are supposed to show it, then is my life really worth living? Fortunately, my colleague was able to console him and show him love. He felt encouraged and made the choice to live. He also became active in my colleagues church where they loved and accepted him. Unfortunately, there are too many people in the world like the caller who feel nothing but hate from Christians. For them Love the sinner, hate the sin is not a message of love. Instead, it is thinly disguised hate. It is also a big, giant But! What does that mean? Beth Woolsey wisely tells us that when many people are the target of this phrase, this is what they really hear: We will love you BUT we will call you Sinner and watch you carefully to determine which of your actions are Sin so we can call you out and Hate those things. Are we surprised then when the love of Christ gets lost in this principle? Love the sinner, hate the sin needs to be stricken from the Christian lexicon. Because, at the end of the day Love the Sinner, Hate the Sin is not biblical. The irony is that many folks who are often fond of saying this phrase are lovers of scripture and can quote you chapter and verse. But you wont find Love the sinner, hate the sin in scripture. So where does it come from? Well, it comes from St. Augustine, from his work, Confessions. The exact quote is With love for humankind, and hatred of sins. When Augustine wrote these words he was referring to his own sins. He was calling himself out on the sins he had committed. But over the centuries Augustines quote has morphed into a way that helps folks point fingers at others. When people say this phrase around me I always reply, Thats funny. Whats funny? they usually asked. I reply, Dont you see that big log in your eye? Dont you see one in my eye? Jesus said in Matthew: Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, Let me take the speck out of your eye, when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye. Matthew 7:3-5 It is clear that Jesus did not teach us to Love the sinner and hate the sin. In fact, he called it hypocritical. He taught the exact opposite. He taught us to Love the sinner and hate your own sin. Jesus told to focus on your own sins and issues that need fixing before we start talking about the sins of others. The truth is the Bible never really gives us permission to judge sin. In fact, when we judge sin, we commit sin. When we sit in judgment on the sins of others, we are playing God and that is idolatry. Now some folks disagree with me on that and they will quote a text from Romans 12:9: Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good. Romans 12:9 This passage does not give us permission to hate other peoples sin; it requires us to hate our own sin. Look at the context of this text and think through this. Ken Collins says it well, Can you make someone elses love genuine? No, you can only make your own love genuine. Can you make another person hold fast to what is good? No, you can only make yourself do that. You can only hate the sin that is inside you, because you are the only human being who knows what is going on inside you. Since you cannot see inside other people, you cannot correctly identify what is inside them, and that means that you are not commanded, permitted, or even qualified to hate someone elses sin. On the other hand, we are not just qualified and permitted, we are commanded to love sinners. Other folks who disagree with me will point to other passages in the Bible that speak of judging fellow believers and helping them. Well, this has to do with accountability, not hating sin and judging others. Accountability begins with someone giving another person permission to hold them accountable. This is much different from judging or hating someone's sin, which is usually done without permission. When we are transformed by the love of Christ we desire and make the choice to be part of a group of believers who will help and encourage us. A key aspect of the help and encouragement is for them to know our weaknesses and sins and to hold us accountable. This is a far cry from getting permission to hate and judge the sins of others. This leads me to another reason why the phrase Love the sinner, hate the sin needs to be eradicated from the church: Jesus did not teach us to call people sinners; he called us to call people neighbors. Jesus did sling around some choice words for some folks, hypocrite, fool, and brood of vipers. But the fascinating thing is Jesus reserved his name-calling for the religious community. Just the read the gospels and you will find that the only thing that angered Jesus was the self-righteousness and hypocrisy of religious people. Jesus only had love and compassion for the broken down, broken hearted, the excluded, the lonely and the outcast. He made them feel big, not small. Woolsey reminds us that Jesus never teaches us to love the sinner. He teaches us to love our neighbor! And to Jesus who is our neighbor? Everyone  the despised, rejected, excluded, ignored, and bullied. Over and over again we find Jesus inviting sinners to dinner, accepting and helping prostitutes and defending the marginalized. Remember that powerful scene in the eighth chapter of the gospel of John where a woman is caught in adultery? The people are getting ready to stone her to death because the law demanded it. And what did Jesus do? He saved her and scattered the crowd by saying, He who is without sin cast the first stone. Now I know what some of you may be thinking. Charley, but remember, Jesus did tell her Your sins are forgiven but he also told her to Go and sin no more. What about that? What about repentance? You are not preaching the whole gospel! Jesus said to sin no more. Thats right. He did say that. Lets take a closer look at the text, shall we? The crowd] said to Jesus, Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. [The Law] commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say? They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus  said to them, Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her. At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?No one, sir, she said. Then neither do I condemn you, Jesus declared. Go now and leave your life of sin. John 8:1-11 Most Christians miss something huge in this text. What did Jesus do in this story? Woolsey reminds us that Jesus defended the woman from the crowd. And who is the crowd? The religious people. Us! So, in this text, Jesus defended the woman from us! Jesus defended the woman from those who wanted to sit in judgment and throw stones. He told that crowd to scram. He told those who said Love the sinner, hate the sin to beat it. It was only after the crowd left that Jesus, and only Jesus, told her to sin no more. The crowd was not there at all. Only Jesus and this woman. Why? Because it is not our job to change the hearts of people. Its not our job to transform people. Thats Jesus job. Our job is to love people as Jesus loves them so they will be receptive to the love and power of Jesus. Nowhere in this text do we find Jesus saying, Hey crowd, tell this lady not to sin anymore. And why? Because it is not our job! Jesus never instructs the crowd to point out the womans sin or exclude her. Jesus never says to the crowd, I told her to sin no more, now you go tell people not to sin, too. The only instruction that we receive from Jesus is to examine our own lives for sin (Woolsey). You see, the saddest thing about sitting in judgment is not that it is usually hypocritical, even though it is. The saddest thing about it is that when we judge others and point out their sins there is a good chance that we will obstruct the love of Christ from touching them and making them whole. We become a barrier to Christ! And I dont know about you but the last thing I want to be is a barrier to Christ! The last thing I want to do is impede Gods love from transforming someone. I wonder how often Christians and the church are barriers instead of vessels of Christs love. Some Christians talk a lot about the Day of Judgment and the doom and gloom of awful sins being judged by God. I certainly believe in the judgment and that God will judge sins. But I believe a large part of Gods judgment will be for those of us who got in the way of Gods love in Christ and therefore impeded someone from experiencing that transforming love. Now am I minimizing sin or dismissing it. No! Am I saying that sins of crime, injustice, and abuse should not be reported and that there should be no consequences for such sins? No! What I am saying is that its rarely our role as Christians to confront the sins of others without permission. I am saying we should be extremely cautious in the rare event that we feel lead to call out sin. I am saying that the bulk of Jesus lessons are "
July-5-2015-sermon,"This is what Communion is all about. It is about receiving the grace of God in Christ when we cannot help or save ourselves. When we eat the bread we remember that Jesus says that we do not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from God. When we drink the juice we remember that it is Jesus sacrificial love that forgives us, set us free and gives us new life. So as you receive these elements today you are saying, God, I cannot help myself. I need your grace and power to deliver me. Help me. And God will. He is simply waiting for us to ask. Amen. I am grateful to Adam Hamilton and his message series Half Truths. It was helpful to me as I prepared this sermon. ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org Pasadena Community Church Bumper Sticker Theology ~ ~ God Helps Those Who Help Themselves? ~ ~ Psalm 10 Sunday, July 5, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today I continue our series called Bumper Sticker Theology. In this series we are taking a look at common platitudes of faith. Sometimes we see them on bumper stickers. Sometimes we hear them from well meaning family members or friends. And perhaps some of you may say these phrases to others. But quite often these popular phrases of faith are casually said without really thinking through what they mean. In fact, some folks think these phrases come straight from the Bible when they are nowhere to be found in scripture. So we are going to take a closer look at these popular phrases of faith and test them with scripture. My hope is that this series will encourage us to think deeper about our faith. I also hope it will help us think biblically about some of the popular theology in our culture. Today we focus on this phrase. Lets say it together: God Helps Those Who Help Themselves. How many of you have ever heard this phrase before? Most of us have. Its been a popular phrase for generations. Jay Leno used to do Jay Walks where he would walk around the streets of New York and ask people questions. One time he asked folks to name just one of the Ten Commandments. So many people responded with God helps those who help themselves. Barna once did some research on the publics knowledge of the Bible. The research concluded that around 81 percent of people interviewed thought the phrase God helps those who help themselves comes from the Bible. And 53 percent thought it was a major theme and message of scripture. Well, of course this phrase does not come from the Bible. It actually comes from Greek Mythology and many years later it was popularized by Benjamin Franklin in Poor Richards Almanac. The phrase is mostly untrue. I say mostly because there is an element of truth to it and I am going to tell you why. But there are more ways this phrase is untrue and therefore the use of this phrase is often misguided. And misusing this phrase is to misunderstand our faith and who we are as followers of Christ. But briefly let me tell you why sometimes this phrase is true. Sometimes it is true that God helps those who help themselves. For example, every week I pray that God would guide, empower and direct me as I prepare my sermons. And I believe he does. But after I pray and open my eyes my sermon does not miraculously appear! Believe me, there are some weeks when I wish it would! God does help and guide me when I prepare sermons but I hold some responsibility as well. God wants me to participate in the process. He wants to use me. I have to work and prepare. The sermon will not write itself! St. Augustine said, Without God, we cannot. Without us, God will not. When you pray before your meal, you thank God for providing the food but when you open your eyes you know the food did not just miraculously appear. You worked and got a paycheck and got the groceries and cooked the meal. If you are unemployed and sit home and pray that God would give you a job but do nothing you will be without a job for the rest of your life. You have to get on the computer, prepare your resume, prepare for interviews and do something. I remember a colleague talking about a couple he knew who were trying to sell their home. It was on the market for a very long time. They prayed and prayed it would sell but it never did. They even put a St. Joseph statue next to the For Sale sign to get it sold but that didnt work. So they went to their pastor and asked him why it wasnt selling. They said they prayed and prayed. Come to find out their real estate agent said they were trying to sell their house 10K over its value. The agent told them if they lowered their price it would sell. They refused. The pastor said, So you are telling me you want a buyer to pay 10K over the value of the house and you are upset it is not selling? They finally came to their senses and lowered it and the house sold in three days. Yes, sometimes it is true that God helps those who help themselves. The Apostle Paul addressed this issue plainly to the church in Thessalonica. They thought the Lord would return soon and some felt they didnt have to do any work. To this Paul says: For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work should not eat. For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living. Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right. -1st Thessalonians 3:10-13 But let me tell you how this phrase is wrong. In fact, I want to tell you two reasons why this phrase is untrue and misused. First of all, Sometimes People Cant Help Themselves. Ill give you an example. The phrase God helps those who help themselves is often used in the context of the homeless. I remember being in a car with some parishioners and we stopped at a light and saw a homeless man holding up a sign for food. There was some discussion and then the driver turned to me and said, The Bible says, God helps those who help themselves, right pastor? I replied, First of all, that phrase is not in the Bible. Second of all, its not always that simple. A pastor I know once was approached by a homeless person who wanted money for food. He was Mr. Fix it, so he said, Ill take you to lunch and help you find a job. They went to lunch and the pastor had a newspaper with job openings circled. After lunch he asked the homeless man, Okay, what is your address and phone number so your future employer can contact you? He replied, I dont have an address or phone. Im homeless. Well, we will worry about that later. Lets get your resume ready. What is your education? He replied, I dropped out of high school because my family needed me to work. Okay, what about references? He replied, Well, if I had references I wouldnt be here! Its rather convenient to say God helps those who help themselves but the truth is sometimes people cannot help themselves. I can tell you in my ministry that I come across many people who are in a pit so dark and deep that they dont know how to get out of it. They cant help themselves  those in nursing homes who cant feed or bathe themselves  helpless and vulnerable children who have nothing to eat  homeless people who are mentally ill and cannot afford the medication they need  orphans and widows left out in the cold  oppressed and abused women and children who need justice someone to be speak up for them  people receiving only minimum wage who cannot afford to get a place of their own because they cannot pay their first months rent up front. And guess what? God calls us to help the helpless and to give hope to the hopeless. God calls us to help the poor and needy and those who cannot help themselves. Take a look at what scripture says: When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field when you reap, nor shall you gather any gleaning from your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God. Leviticus 23:22 Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world. James 1:27 In the gospel of Luke we find the parable of the Good Samaritan and the Sheep and the Goats and in those parables we learn that ultimately God will judge our faith based upon how our faith moved us to compassion to help the poor, needy, wounded, and the beaten, broken and bruised. The book of Proverbs gives us insight as well: Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD, and will be repaid in full. Proverbs 19:17 If you close your ear to the cry of the poor, you will cry out and not be heard. Proverbs 21:13 You see, God does help those who cant help themselves and you want to know how he does it? By sending you and me. God moves our hearts to help others! On this fourth of July weekend we celebrate our freedom and our wonderful country. And a lot of people talk about this being a Christian nation or wanting it to be a Christian nation. Well, here is the honest gospel truth. If we want to be a Christian nation one of our top priorities should be to help the poor and needy because that is what the Bible calls us to do and, more specifically, what Jesus commands that we do. So as a nation unless we are willing to help the helpless and vulnerable we cannot call ourselves a Christian nation. Jesus says if anyone claims to be right with God but doesn't serve the poor, needy, oppressed, marginalized, sick, diseased, and sinful, then they do not have a relationship with God. No matter what they proclaim with their lips. No matter how religious they may appear. What does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God? Micah 6:8 I love that we as Pasadena take what the Lord requires of us seriously  using our kitchen not just to feed ourselves but to feed those in need at the Fisher House and through Pinellas Hope  using our gym not just for sports but to also run a food pantry that helps hundreds of families  offering a counseling center for people and having financial support available for those who cant afford the counseling they need  having a mentor program Gulfport Elementary  offering support groups for those who suffer. The list goes on and on. Through PCC God is helping those who cant help themselves! God helps us help others! Another big reason why the phrase God helps those who help themselves is wrong is because the gospel message is the exact opposite! God Saves Us When We Cannot Save Ourselves. The gospel message is that God saves and delivers us when we make a mess of our lives. God gives us hope when we are hopeless. Our God is a God of the hopeless and helpless. And let me tell you, without God and his grace, all of us are hopeless and helpless. I dont care who you are, all of us have been or will get to a place in life when we need help and hope beyond ourselves. You know what grace is, right? It is receiving the blessings of God when we dont deserve it? And how many of us have received Gods blessings when we havent deserved them? All of us have! I cant tell you how many times in my life when I have been helpless and God pulled me up out of the pit. Sometimes he put people in my life to provide the things that I could not provide for myself. And sometimes God provided for me directly. Folks, the Lord helps and provides us with things that we could never obtain on our own  feeling a sense of love and belonging, having a purpose to our lives, receiving peace in the midst of a storm, getting hope when we fill hopeless. God meets those needs and more. We cannot. So yes, God helps us when we cant help ourselves. And Hallelujah for that! In my distress I called to the LORD; I cried to my God for help. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his ears. Psalm 18:6 I lift up my eyes to the hillsfrom where will my help come? My help comes from the LORD, who made heaven and earth. Psalm 121:1-2 The truth is when others are helpless God helps us help them. And when we are helpless God helps others to help us. And, most of all, when we are helpless God hears our cries and loves and saves and delivers us directly by his grace. Only God can make us clean and whole. We cant. Only God can. Today you may feel helpless. Maybe your marriage needs saving or you are in the clutches of addiction and need help beyond yourself. Perhaps you feel lost and without hope or feel ashamed and desire redemption. Just reach out to God. He can and will help you when you cant help yourself. He can save you. He can make you whole. Just reach out to him and he will pick you up. "
June-14-2015-sermon,"would never get a foul ball. My dad could see I was disappointed and said, Charley, give me your hat. Im going to catch a foul ball with this thing! So he took my hat. It wasnt ten minutes before a ball was fouled back and it bounced over two groups in front of us and right into my cap. My dad handed me the ball and said, Here you go! I told you! My dad believed we make our own fun. He taught me that happiness is a choice we make. Lesson #5: Gods Grace Will Get You through Any Storm This picture was taken when I was a senior high school, just over a year after my dad was diagnosed with cancer. I was amazed the way my dad responded to his cancer. Even in the midst of great pain and fatigue he never lost his sense of humor or his abiding faith. I remember my dad quoting a passage of scripture to me. I was talking with him about which scripture passage meant the most to him. He read this one with tears in his eyes: But he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christs power may rest on me. That is why, for Christs sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. -2nd Corinthians 12:9-10 My dad did not believe God gave him cancer but he did believe that his cancer gave him the opportunity to show others how strong God is. I will never forget the last time I saw my dad. He had a peace about him. He knew that God would never let go of him and not even death was going to separate him from God. He gave me a big hug and told me he loved me and how proud he was of me. As I left his room I knew that would be the last time I would see him on earth. But as I looked into his eyes I knew that he knew that because of the grace of God the worst thing is never the last thing. So on this Fathers Day I leave you with one of my favorite pictures of me and my dad. This was taken on a Fathers Day when I was about 11 or 12. I gave him new head bands and wrist bands to wear when we played tennis. Some of my best memories of my dad were on the tennis court. I love this picture because it reminds me of the lessons my dad taught me: A day without laughter is a day wasted. Put faith and family first. Enjoy the present moment. Happiness is a choice we make. Gods grace will get you through any storm. My father led me to seek help from my heavenly father. Amen Pasadena Community Church LLLLLeeeeessssssssssooooonnnnns ssssfffffrrrrrooooom mmmmMMMMMy yyyyFFFFFaaaaattttthhhhheeeeer rrrrSunday, June 14, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor On this Fathers Day Im going to do something a little different for my message. Im going to tell you the most important lessons I learned from my father -lessons that have shaped me and made me the person I am today. My Dad had a huge impact on my life. I wouldnt be who I am today without him. I benefit from the wisdom of his lessons every single day. And whether you are a father, mother, sister, brother, husband or wife I believe the lessons he taught me will make a difference to your life as well. In my ministry I have always been intentional about being sensitive on Fathers Day. I recognize that not everyone has a positive experience of their father. I get it. In fact, my father was not my biological father. He was my step dad but I consider him my father because he entered my life when I was two years old and was a huge part of my life until his death when I was 19 years old. My biological father is still living but he is not in my life the way I would like him to be and thats disappointing to me. But this is what I believe  I believe God provides father figures in our lives when we need them. Everyone needs a father figure on some level and when we dont have one or we have a negative experience of our father, God will provide people in our lives who can play that role if we are open to it. Since my dads death over 20 years ago God has put father figures in my life when I have needed them and he continues to do that. So, if this day is tough for you I understand. My message to you is to pray and keep your eyes open because God will provide a father figure in your life. So here is a picture of my dad. His name was Paul Harold Reeb. He was originally from Toledo, Ohio. He grew up in the funeral business. His dad owned and ran a funeral home in Sylvania, Ohio. My dad operated the funeral home with his father for close to 20 years. That funeral home is still there and it is still called Reeb Funeral Home but it is no longer in the family. In fact, it still has the same slogan, When you are in need call Reeb. My dad moved on from the funeral business and was successful in various careers. He was a stock broker. He ran a business school. He was a car salesman and owned a Cadillac dealership. And in the last 20 years of his life he was a career consultant. My dad had a demonstrative, jovial, and gregarious personality which made him a success in just about everything he did. Everyone loved being around my father. He lit up a room. My dad was also a gifted athlete. He was a scratch golfer and a collegiate tennis champion. Of course his biggest success was the great father he was to me. He met my mother around 1975. My mom worked for him at his business school. She was a single mother of course. My twin sister and I were two and my older sister Jill was five. He fell in love with my mother and he fell in love with all three of us. One of the big reasons why my dad was such a great dad was because he taught me so many wonderful lessons. Some of these lessons he taught me directly and others he taught me just by the way he lived his life and the example he set for me. I dont have time to share all of them but there are a few I want to touch on today. I believe they apply to all of us. Lesson #1: A Day without Laughter is a Day Wasted You may wonder where I get my loud ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org laugh. Well, you have my dad to thank for that. You think I have a big laugh? Well, you should have heard his! My dad taught me that laughter is an important part of enjoying life and there is much to laugh about in this world. To my dad, if something was funny, it was hilarious. To my Dad, laughter was a gift from God. It was medicine for the soul. My dad believed what it says in Job 8:21: He (God) will fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting. They say that the sound of heaven is not singing but laughter. I sure hope so because my house was always filled with the sound of laughter  loud, boisterous and fun laughter. Jokes were always being told, funny memories were always being shared. Growing up my house was just a circus of laughter. Of course we took that laughter with us. We laughed so much as a family that we almost got kicked out of restaurants and movie theatres. My dad was always the ring leader of this fun and laughter. Fun and laughter seemed to follow my dad wherever he went. He had a way of attracting it. A good example is one of stories in my family that will live in infamy. My dad loved to eat. It was a real hobby for him. As a result, he had the Dunlop Disease. His belly dun lopped over his belt! When he sat down to eat, he would often unbuckle his belt and unbutton his pants so his stomach could breathe. One morning we went to Shoneys breakfast buffet. He took two plates to the buffet and filled them up. He returned to the table and, of course, unbuckled his belt, unbuttoned his pants, pulled his shirt over his pants and commenced the eating. It wasnt long before it was time to get seconds, so my dad, excited about the next round of Shoneys buffet goodness, picked up the two plates, one in his left hand, and one in his right hand, and walked back to the buffet. But he forgot one very important thing. He forgot to buckle his belt and pants. So about half-way to the buffet, in the middle of several booths and tables filled with people enjoying their breakfast, my dads pants fell down to his ankles! My dad was standing in his underwear in the middle of Shoneys! I saw a lady eating her pancakes almost cough them up as she looked at my dad with her jaw opened and her eyes popped out. Im just glad my dad was wearing underwear! My dad turned red and so did I as I sunk under the table. I mean, I was a high school kid who was still dealing with being embarrassed by my parents. And this happened! Im still scarred from it! My mom just sat there turning purple with laughter. Well, my dad had plates in his hands so he could not pulled up his pants, so he shuffled back to the table, quickly threw the plates on the table, pulled up his pants and said, Ill be in the car! I dont know if that Shoneys is still around. They may have gone out of business the next day. It if it is still around, I bet the staff is still talking about the man whose pants fell down at the buffet. I know the people who were eating breakfast never forgot it! And, of course, my family will never forget it either! My dad taught me that a day without laughter is a day wasted. Lesson #2: Put Faith and Family First One of my dads favorite verses was Seek first the Kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you (Matthew 6:33). My dad believed that if you got your priorities straight, if you put God and your loved ones first in your life, everything else would take care of itself. But, you see, my dad not only believed it he lived it out. Here is a family portrait taken right after church one day. I remember taking it because I was starving and couldnt wait to have lunch! I remember a lot of things about my dad. I remember before we ate meals he would often take my hand and pray. I remember watching my dad read the Bible. I remember sitting in church with my parents and watching them put their tithe in the offering plate. I remember riding in the car after church and my dad talking about the sermon and the wonderful Sunday school lesson my mom taught. I remember scheming with my sisters, trying to get out of going to big church but my dad would say always say no. We need to be in worship. These were critical memories for me. They would shape and mold me. So fathers, be aware. Your children look at your faith and how you live it out. Even the little things make a difference. I remember my dad holding my moms hand in church. I remember my dad hugging and kissing my mom and telling her he loved her. We said I love you to one another all the time in our house because my dad modeled it for us. My dad gave a wonderful gift to me and my sisters  he loved my mom. Dads, one of the greatest gifts you can give to your children is to love your wife. Seeing my dad genuinely love my mom gave me security and taught me what it looks like to love and adore your wife. Dads, you cant teach that. You must model it. My dad was a hard worker and very successful in what he did but he never let work get in the way of church or family. He was there for every baseball game, tennis match, and concert. In fact, sometimes he was too much there! During my tennis matches he would sit right next to the court and huff and puff louder than me. He would shout out, Get the shot! Get the shot! He was more into the match than me! A few times I had to ask him to take a break and walk around for a little while! We never missed family vacations and holiday gettogethers with family and loved ones. My dad knew those with the precious times you cant get back. My dad was wise. He knew that at the end of life it is those times you spent with God and loved ones that matter the most. Lesson #3: Enjoy the Present Moment My dad showed me what it means to live the abundant life every day. Wherever he was and whatever he was doing was the most exciting thing in the world! Whatever meal he was eating was the best meal he ever had. Whatever book he was reading was the best book he ever read. Whatever movie he just watched was the best movie that we ever made. My recognized saw beauty, passion and brilliance in ordinary things every single day and he was compelled to tell you about it. Every time was saw a plane in the sky my dad would shout, Look at that! Look at that! Would you look at that! Isnt that amazing that something so big can fly in the air! My dad thoroughly enjoyed every moment of life. Here is a picture that proves it. Hes stealing a sip of my twin sister Nancys milkshake. My dad loved his ice cream. And he didnt believe in bowls. He didnt know what a bowl was. He believed that ice cream was meant to be eaten right out of the carton it came in. He would open up the carton and pour Planters peanuts and Hershey syrup on it and then he would top it off with whipped cream. My dads enthusiasm for life was inexhaustible. My dad never forgot that the second fruit of the spirit is joy! In Galatians 5:22-23 the Apostle Paul writes, but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control I think the Apostle Paul was intentional in the way he put together that list. Next to love, joy is one of the most significant ways we express that the spirit of God lives in our hearts. If you were around my father it didnt take you long to see his joy. My dad knew he was a child of God and was fully aware of all his blessings. He knew God had given him so much and there was so much to be joyful about. My dad felt that there were so many things around him to be grateful for and get excited about! He never understood why people could not just enjoy their lives. This aspect of my dad reminds me what the Dalai Lama said when he was asked about what surprised him the most about humanity: ""Man.... Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived."" My dad never had that problem. He really lived the abundant life of Christ! Im glad he did or I would have never gotten a go-cart or a motorcycle! My mom was against both but my dad said to her, Oh Jane! Charley will be in hog heaven riding around in that thing! And I was in hog heaven riding around in those things! Lesson #4: Happiness is a Choice We Make My Dads joy gave him his greatest asset  his attitude. His attitude reminds me of Nehemiah 8:10: For the joy of the Lord is your strength. I think it was my dads joyful and positive attitude that had the biggest impact on me. He truly believed that life is 10 percent what happens to you and 90 percent how you respond to it. And now I believe it too! I remember coming home upset one day because I had asked a girl to go out with me and she said no. When I told my dad what happened he said, Big deal! Charley, come on. As a salesman, I get told no all day long. Out of 20 people Ill get 18 nos and 2 yeses. But those two yeses make all the difference. If I gave up every time someone said no we would starve! Dont give up! Sooner or later you will get a yes. And thank God Brandy said, Yes. I remember my dad taking me to my first Braves game. It was 1984 and I was eleven years old. The Braves were terrible back then but it didnt matter to me. This was my first major league baseball game! That night they were playing the San Diego Padres and my dad got great seats right behind home plate! We were sitting in an area that got a lot of foul balls. Throughout the game foul balls were flying all around us, just outside our reach. The game progressed along and I thought we "
June-28-2015-sermon,"Everything that happens to you is not Gods will but God has a will in everything that happens to you. God has a will to turn your trouble into triumph. That is the story of the Bible. God is in the transformation business. When evil attacks with difficulty, God transforms it in a way that brings Him glory. This means that what life throws at you is not Gods will, but God can take your difficulty and do productive things with it. You dont have to be a victim in life! You can walk in confidence in the Lord. You can say, I dont know what this day is going to bring, but I know that God will bring me through it. I know that there is nothing I am going to face that God and I cant handle. I know by the power of God I will be more than a conqueror! How do you do this? What is the first step? Pray, Lord, I hand my pain over to you. You take it and use it for your purposes and glory. Use it in whatever way you want to use it, Lord. It is yours. Do with it what you will. You may want to keep a journal and mark the day you gave your difficulty to God. Keep track of it and you may be amazed one day how God used it for good! An inspiring story appeared in the news recently that shows us what the world means for evil God uses for good. This is James Wilmert. He goes to school in Minneapolis. He has a learning disability which makes him an easy target for bullies. He ate by himself at lunch and never played with any other kids. He never had friends come over to his house to play. James was adopted from an orphanage in Colombia. Six years after he was adopted his adoptive father was killed in an accident. James life was filled with pain and loneliness. But all that changed one day at school. James was being teased and bullied on the playground. Five kids a grade above James saw him being bullied and right then and there made a pact to have his back. Their names are Jack, Jake, Gus, Tyler and Landon. And here is a picture of them with James. They protect him at school. Every day at lunch they invited him to sit at their table. After lunch, they play football with him and make sure he gets his share of carries and touchdowns. Before he never went out to play. Now he can barely eat his lunch to can get out and play with his five new friends. The kids know he doesnt have a father to throw a ball to him and they have gladly taken on that role. These five kids are changing him. He loves sports and he is becoming more confident. And get this! When the boys found out James didn't own a video game system, they pitched in with their own money to buy him a brand new Play station! James mom took this picture at home. She said it was the first time friends from school had ever come over to play with him. A reporter was sent to cover this story and he saw them in a group hug and he heard James say, All these guys are the best friends anybody could ask for. I love you guys (sunnyskyz.com). You see God took something very ugly in James life and made it beautiful. God took hate and cruelty and transformed into kindness and friendship. It wasnt Gods will that James be bullied but God had a will in the midst of his pain and that was to give him five friends who would have his back and care for him and play with him and give him confidence. What the world meant for evil God used for good. Hate wont win. Only love wins. With God nothing is impossible. Everything that happens to you is not Gods will but God has a will in everything that happens to you. Amen Pasadena Community Church Bumper Sticker Theology ~ ~ Everything Happens for a Reason? ~ ~ Sunday, June 28, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today I begin a new sermon series called Bumper Sticker Theology. In this series we will be taking a look at common platitudes of faith. Sometimes we see them on bumper stickers. Sometimes we hear them from well meaning family members or friends. And perhaps some of you may say these phrases to others. But quite often these popular phrases of faith are casually said without really thinking through what they mean. In fact, quite often people think these phrases come straight from the Bible when they are nowhere to be found in scripture. So we are going to take a closer look at these popular phrases of faith and test them with scripture. My hope is that this series will encourage us to think deeper about our faith. I also hope it will help us think biblically about some of the popular theology in our culture. Today we begin with a very popular theological phrase. In fact, to me this statement has increased in popularity over the last few years. Even folks who dont consider themselves religious are quick to say this: Everything happens for a reason. How many of you have heard that one? Usually this platitude is said in the context of difficulty or adversity. We get bad news. We are disappointed. Life takes a bad turn and we have a well meaning friend say to us, Everything happens for a reason. Now, this phrase comes in other forms: God must be testing you or It must be Gods will or Things dont happen to you; they happen for you. All of these religious phrases could fall under the heading of Everything happens for a reason. And they all mean that your difficulty, bad news, problem, or adversity was planned by a higher power, the universe or God. It was supposed to happen to you. There is a larger reason why it happened to you. It was intentional. When Christians say it they mean God orchestrated or planned your adversity for a purpose. God has predetermined everything. We are the puppets and God is manipulating the strings. We just go by the script. Everything that happens, even tragedy and difficulty, has been scripted by God. I guess some people get comfort by what this platitude implies, but do we really believe that EVERYTHING happens for a reason? Do we really believe that God has orchestrated all the pain and tragedy in our lives? Do we really believe that? Do we really believe that when a baby dies God needed another angel in heaven? Do we really believe that God plotted 9/11 for a purpose like testing our country? Do we really believe that the church shooting in Charleston happen for a reason? Do we really believe that God is behind the bloodshed and tragedy in the world? Do we really believe that God intentionally plots suffering to see if we can pass a test? And if we do believe all this, what does it say about the God we believe in? I recall doing a funeral for a man in another church I served. After the funeral I attended a reception at the familys home. I was having refreshments in the living room with some of the family of the deceased. Sitting next to me was a middle aged woman who was a member of the family. I didnt know her. I had just met her that day. She was a very honest person. She looked at me and said, Im not a big fan of ministers. I smiled and said, I get it. Im not always a big fan of ministers either. A lot of folks have trouble with ministers for very good reasons! I asked, So, why do you have issues with ministers? I was not prepared for what she said. Under ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org normal circumstances I dont think she would have been so forthcoming but grief can instill liberating honesty. She said, When I was in my twentys my mother died of cancer. It was devastating because I was very close with my mother. At the time I had a friend who was a strong Christian tell me that everything happens for a reason. She said that I needed to accept this as Gods will and move on. When she said that I decided I would never have anything to do with God, religion or the church. I did my best to explain to her how wrong and insensitive her friends remarks were but the spiritual damage had been done. Did her friend have good intentions? Sure. Was she just trying to be comforting? Sure. But the religious platitude presented God as someone who planned that tragedy in her life and she wanted nothing to do with a God like that. I cant blame her. When I was in seminary one of my best friends in college was killed by a drunk driver. He and his girlfriend were on bikes in Austin, Texas on their way to the hill country for the afternoon. In my friends pocket was an engagement ring. He was going to propose marriage to her that day. That proposal never happened. A drunk driver struck both of them, killing my friend instantly. His girlfriend suffered multiple injuries and was in a coma for two months. I was invited by my friends family to read scripture and speak at the funeral. I remember going to the viewing the day before the funeral. It was an open casket. I recall looking at my friend in the casket and someone standing next to me saying something I will never forget. I dont know who the person was, but he looked at my friend in the casket and said, It is hard to understand Gods will sometimes. Now I was ready to give that man a good sermon, but it wasnt the time or place. I simply turned to him and said, God didnt do this! A drunk driver did! God often gets blamed for things that God did not do! We have all heard the language. A baby dies and someone says, God needed another angel in heaven. A young mother dies of breast cancer leaving a husband and two kids behind and someone says, God works in mysterious ways. A 50 year old overworks his whole life, doesnt take care of himself, and dies of a heart attack and someone says, The Lord knows best. A group of teenagers on their way to prom are killed in a car accident and someone says, God must have had a purpose. What? In other words, Everything happens for a reason. Some of you will remember that several days after 9/11 a well known religious figure went on television and told the world that God orchestrated 9/11 to punish America for its sins. He said abortionists, feminists, gays and lesbians had angered God and 9/11 was the way God chose to punish us. Then there was the 2010 earthquake in Haiti that annihilated over 200,000 people. Another well known religious figure got on TV and said that God caused that earthquake. Why? You ready for this? God was punishing Haiti because of its 200 year old Voo Doo practices. And then we wonder why some folks are turned off by Christians and the church? And then we wonder why some folks dont want to have anything to do with organized religion? It is beyond me how some folks who read the same Bible I do and follow the same Christ that I follow can believe that God would orchestrate unspeakable tragedy and pain in life. It is beyond me how some folks believe that the same God who personified himself in Christ and put little children on his knee would kill children with cancer, kill teenagers through car accidents, and wipe out families with tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes. It is beyond me. Bottom line folks  Everything does not happen for a reason, at least not in the way people usually mean that phrase. The God I know and love would not plot and plan suffering and tragedy. Sometimes things happen because of the foolishness of others. Sometimes things happen because of our own bad choices. Sometimes things happen because we live in an evil and imperfect world. But lets not blame tragedy and suffering on God. When God created us He gave us free will. He loves us enough to allow us to choose to love Him back. Otherwise, we would be a bunch of robots programmed to love and there is really no such thing as forced love. But the shadow side to a world with free will is that there is room for bad choices, mistakes, bad timing and decisions, all of which can cause pain, difficulty, frustration, tragedy and adversity. But when bad things happen it doesnt mean God caused them to happen. In fact, Jesus himself dispelled this misguided belief in the gospel of Luke. In the 13th chapter Jesus references a construction tragedy that killed 18 laborers. Many people in Jesus day assumed that God caused the accident to punish the laborers for their sins. Jesus completely rejected the idea. This is what Jesus said in verse 4, Those eighteen who died when the tower of Siloam fell on them  do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? I tell you  no! There it is  straight from the Bible! And I know that many of you need that reassurance because for too long you have heard Christians blame catastrophes on God. For too long many of you have been heart by people who say in the midst of your pain, Everything happens for a reason. In this text Jesus said, No! Of course, the big question this morning is  if not everything happens for a reason, if God is not behind my tragedy and difficulty, then how do I deal with it? How do I make sense of it? If so much of the pain I experience in life is based on the free will of others and the free will of the world, then how am I to be prepared for it when it comes? How am I supposed to handle it? Do I just sit back and act like a victim? Where is God when it hurts? Where is God when planes crash and earthquakes come and people die in car accidents? Where is God when people are shot at a prayer meeting? Where is God and is He involved at all? You may be suffering today and want to know the answer to that question. Maybe you are dealing with a great burden or difficulty today and you are trying to make sense of it and you dont know how. Perhaps you wonder where God is in all of it. Maybe you are wondering if God cares and if He can do anything about your difficulty. This morning I want to share with you a passage of scripture that has changed my life. In fact, this is my favorite passage in the entire Bible. It has carried me through many challenges in my life. It has opened my eyes to things I would have never imagined. This passage has changed the way I see adversity in my life. I have written it down over and over again. I have repeated it as a mantra. I have underlined it in every Bible I have had since I was a teenager. I want to share this passage with you because I believe it can change your life too. The passage appears in the book of Romans. Paul is addressing a group of Christians who are familiar with adversity. They have been persecuted for their faith in every way imaginable. They have also dealt with the disappointments of life that all of us share. Paul helps them make sense of their suffering by articulating where God is in all of it. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?  Romans 8:35 Are you worried, afraid or discouraged? Go ahead and make a list of what is difficult for you? Paul makes his own list  hardship, pain, peril, nakedness, the sword? Make a list of your own set of problems right now. Maybe you are lonely, sad, afraid, ashamed, confused, or overwhelmed. Make your list and then ask yourself Pauls question: Is there anything on that list that can keep the love of Christ away from you? Paul answers that. Take a look: No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 8:37-39 This is the greatest NO in the Bible. Paul says, No! Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ! This means that no matter how dark your life gets, no matter how painful or disappointing life becomes Gods love will always be there to sustain you and empower you. You can handle anything in life because God is always with you! In fact in Isaiah it says that God not only is with us but he carries our sorrows. Wherever you are, whatever you are going through, whatever pain you are in God carries your sorrows. He shares it with you. He cries with you. He aches with you. He loves you too much for you to deal with it alone. You see, Jesus death tells us that when we suffer, God suffers with us. That is what the cross and resurrection is all about  God suffers when we suffer and He has the power to redeem our suffering. Thats what Paul meant when he said, We are more than conquerors. Romans 8:37. You see, God is not only with us in the midst of our pain, he not only helps us carry our pain, he not only helps us get through it, but helps us be more than conquerors! How is that possible? How can we more than conquer our pain, difficulty and adversity? Here is the answer: We know that all things work together for good for those who love God who are called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28 You know what this means? This means that suffering and tragedy is never Gods will but God can take what is ugly in your life and make it beautiful. So here is todays message: "

We are focusing on the New Testament now. Last week we covered the entire New Testament in 30 Minutes. We learned about the four main sections of the New Testament  Gospels, The Acts of Apostles, The Epistles, and Revelation. We discovered that the gospels reveal the heart and character of God. Acts and the Epistles show the church is Gods best hope for the world and that each of us plays a key role in the church. And the book of Revelation emphasizes that God has the last word. Today we are going to learn more about the four gospels  Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. We are a going to discover how each of them tells the story of Jesus in their own inspirational way. In fact, the four gospels give four powerful portraits of Jesus. What I have found in my own journey of faith is how much I need all four portraits of Jesus for my spiritual strength and growth. Today you are going to learn through each of the gospels why Jesus is the Savior of the world and how he can change your life and give you strength for living. Before we learn the powerful lessons that each gospel teaches us, I want you know how the four gospels came to be written. For the first few decades after Jesus resurrection the New Testament was not a book but a person  Jesus Christ. The gospel spread orally from person to person like wildfire transforming people. The early decades of the Christian faith contained no documents, just the Apostles preaching and teaching and healing. Yes, they drew upon Old Testament texts that they believed pointed to Jesus, but their central message was the life, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus. But here is the interesting thing. As the Apostles got older some people began writing down what the Apostles said about Jesus. Their thinking was These guys are not going to live forever and so we need to be sure this awesome stuff gets down on paper! This became known as pre-gospel material. This was the raw material that would aid the writing of the four gospels in the New Testament. Around 65A.D. followers of Christ began taking the pre-gospel material that was written down about the Apostles experiences of Jesus and formulating what we know as the gospels. So you have the gospel of Mark, the first gospel written around 65 AD. They were the memoirs of Peter, interpreted and translated by Mark. Then around 80 AD you have Matthew and Luke being written. They relied on Mark and other pre gospel material, and they were experiences of the Apostles as well. Then later John was written around 90AD. Matthew, Mark and Luke are called synoptic gospels, meaning they are very similar. However, John is a maverick gospel. It is a more spiritual gospel that reveals who Jesus is theologically. So lets get down to what the gospels teach us about Jesus and how he is the help and hope of the world! We begin with Matthew. Even though Matthew was not the first gospel written it was placed first in the New Testament for one very good reason: Matthews overriding message is that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Old Testament. Jesus life and teachings complete the teachings of the Hebrew Bible. Thats why it begins with a long genealogy showing Jesus came from the line of King David and was and is the long waited messiah and savior that God had promised. Jesus is the fulfillment of the all the Law and Prophets. Heres an ancient portrait of the Jesus revealed in Matthew. Here is a quick time line. In the beginning God saw humans worshipping many gods and picked Abraham to tell people there was only one God. So God spoke to Abraham and said, Hey Abraham! Im picking you and your offspring to represent me to the world. So tell them it is just me up here. I am the only God. There is only one God and its me. Tell them that! Then God saw that his people didnt know how to live healthy lives and treat each other right. They didnt know how to get along. So God said to Moses, Let me give you these ten rules. Tell my people to live by these rules and life will be as I created it to be. They need boundaries. The people of God were faithful for awhile and then they messed up and asked God for forgiveness and God forgave them. But God still didnt think they had a clear picture of who he was and why he created them. So God said, Ill send a bunch of preachers to tell them and I will call them prophets. I will ask them to say it plainly to them: I dont want your animal sacrifices and obsession with rules. I dont want you to just be a bunch of rule followers. You have missed the point. I want love in your hearts. I want you to love me and love the world. I want you to be merciful and just. I want you to be faithful to me and take care of my people. The people of God and their leaders listened for awhile, but then they disobeyed God. Finally, God said, I guess Im going to have to do this myself. Im going to show them who I really am and how I want them to live. Im going to save them from themselves. So God showed up on the earth in Jesus. Jesus was God in the flesh! He gave us the clearest picture of God. In Jesus we see that God is a God of love, mercy, forgiveness and grace. He summed up the Law and Prophets with the greatest commandment. He went all the way to the cross and said, This is how much I love you. In Jesus we finally have 20/20 vision of God. Therefore, Jesus is the lens through which we view all of scripture. We read the Bible in light of Gods revelation to us in Jesus Christ. Matthew underscores who God is in Jesus by showing how Jesus fulfilled many prophecies in the Old Testament. In Matthew alone there are over 25 messianic predictions in the Old Testament fulfilled in Jesus. And 12 times Matthew cites biblical prophets as they relate to Jesus as messiah. For example, take a look at this prophecy in Isaiah: Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. Isaiah 7:14 Then look at how Matthew tells of the fulfillment of this prophecy: She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel(which means God with us). Matthew 1:21-23 Now look at this prophecy is from Hosea: When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. Hosea 11:1 And now look at the fulfillment in Matthew: So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: Out of Egypt I called my son. Matthew 2:14-15 One more from Zechariah: Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. Zechariah 9:9 And now the fulfillment from Matthew: Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away. This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet. Matthew 21:1-4 So in Matthew we see that Jesus was and is the long awaited messiah, the clearest picture we have of God. He is the perfect Mosaic teacher giving the greatest sermon ever preached, the sermon on the mount, embodying God and how he wants us to live. When we turn to Mark we see another portrait of Jesus. Mark wanted to show us that Jesus is the Crucified God. Here is a picture of Marks Jesus. Its really fascinating what Mark highlights in Jesus ministry to convey his message. In Mark you will find the most puzzling texts about Jesus trying to keep his identity a secret. Which is strange, right? You would think Jesus would say, Tell everyone you can about me! Thats not what is emphasized in Mark. For example, take a look at this story about Jesus from Mark 7: 31 Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. 32 There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him. 33 After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the mans ears. Then he spit and touched the mans tongue. 34 He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, Ephphatha! (which means Be opened!). 35 At this, the mans ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. 36 Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. What? Why not tell anyone? And you see example after example of this in Marks gospel. Why did Jesus want people to keep his identity a secret? Because in Mark we see that Jesus wanted people to know that he came to earth not to be a side show or a wonder worker. He came to earth to show the world how much he loves us by dying for us on a cross. He came to earth to give us the most profound expression of love. The message of Mark is driven home at Jesus crucifixion: At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. And at three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? (which means My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?).When some of those standing near heard this, they said, Listen, hes calling Elijah. Someone ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. Now leave him alone. Lets see if Elijah comes to take him down, he said. With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last. The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, saw how he died, he said, Surely this man was the Son of God! Mark 15:33-39 Notice it was the centurion, the very man in charge of Jesus torture and death, who recognized that Jesus was the Son of God. Why? Because in that moment the centurion saw the depth and power of Gods sacrificial love. Folks, it is Gods example of sacrificial love lived out in our lives that will transform this world. Mark shows us that God almighty came to earth to display the greatest expression of love for us, by dying for us. And through his death and resurrection he overcame death, sin, hopelessness. Through his death and resurrection he redeemed us. And his death shows us that God is one who understands and empathizes and comes along side to help us, heal us, encourage us. We dont have a God who doesnt want to understand us or who doesnt understand us. We dont have a God who is distant and aloof. We have a God who cares so much for us and loves us so much that he became one of us and suffered in the most brutal way so that we would know that he knows what its like to be us. When we are in pain, he feels it. He knows. I want you to hear that today. Wherever you are, whatever you are going through, whatever pain you are in, God carries your sorrows. He knows. He shares it with you, He cries with you. He aches with you. He loves you too much for you to deal with it alone. He will help you carry your sorrows and redeem your suffering. Mark shows us the crucified God who suffers for us and suffers with us. Mark shows us God in Christ and walking with us through our suffering and redeeming it. Now, we get to the gospel of Luke. Luke is a gospel that shows us the relentless love of God in Jesus Christ for all people. Luke shows us that Jesus Seeks and Saves the Lost. In Luke we find that Jesus heart breaks for the lost, the poor, the down and out, the thrown out, the neglected, the beaten, broken and bruised. Here is a painting of Jesus as portrayed in Luke, reaching out to a poor man. Luke shows Jesus hanging out with sinners and tax collectors showing them God loves them. It is in Luke we find Jesus preaching his first sermon proclaiming that he has come to release the oppressed, to give sight to the blind, and to heal the broken. Its in Luke we find the Parable of the Prodigal Son and the Parable of the Good Samaritan, parables about how the outsiders become the insiders. Its in Luke we find the gospel within the gospel, Luke 15, which begins with the Parable of the Lost Sheep: Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, This man welcomes sinners and eats with them. Then Jesus told them this parable: Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesnt he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep. I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent. Luke 15:1-7 Riley Short was a great minister in our conference. I was his associate at First, Lakeland for four years and he survived! Riley loves to tell the story of the time early in his ministry when he was working on a sermon in his study. It had been a very busy week for him. He was tired and cranky, and he just wanted to get his sermon done. He was in the middle of an important thought when his 8 year old daughter barged in to his study without knocking and said, Hey daddy! You would not believe what I heard today! Riley got very upset and said, What do you think you are doing? You dont just barge in here without knocking. Daddy is working on a sermon and cant talk right now. You go outside and play and I will talk to you later. This took the wind right out of her sail. Riley sat back down at his desk, and he tried to keep going on his sermon but he couldnt. The ideas and thoughts would not come. In his frustration he sensed God say to him, Riley, you think you are so "
Mar-15-2015-sermon,"can experience Gods justifying grace right now. All you have to do is call out to Christ and ask for it. Paul said in Romans, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Call out, Lord, I turn away from my sin and the things that are dragging me down and I surrender to your love and grace. Cleanse me, renew me, and give me new life, I will follow you. Of course, Gods grace does not stop there. Fortunately, once we make the decision to surrender to Gods grace and follow Christ, we are supported, strengthened, encouraged, and nourished by the Sanctifying Grace of God. His Spirit inside of us motivates us to grow closer to the likeness of Christ and love one another as God has loved us. In other words, the grace of God is a gift and a calling. God brings transformation to us and then by Gods sanctifying grace he calls us to help him bring transformation to the world. We receive the grace of God and then we channel it out. Paul describes Gods sanctifying grace in Philippians: In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. Philippians 1:4-6 Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed -not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence -continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose. Philippians 2:12-13 The experience of Gods grace initiates a journey of transformation in ourselves and the world. We grow individually and we grow in our relationships.

It is just the beginning. Gods grace invites our participation. The sanctifying grace of God involves a synergy of Gods power and our participation. We get to cooperate with God in helping bring transformation to the world! We are on a journey together to spread Gods transforming love to the whole world. I want to close by showing you a picture of what is known as Pando. It is also known the Trembling Giant. Pando is located in Aspen, Colorado and is known as one of the wonders of the natural world. Why? It is a collection of 43,000 trees covering about 106 acres. Its about 80,000 years old. Why is it a wonder of the natural world? Because it is one organism. You see, all the trees share the same root system. Pando in Latin means to spread. And this organism as one root system has been spreading for thousands of years. Folks, this world has the same root system. It is the grace and love of God. God created this world. God sustains this world. God created you and God created me. God created all of us. The love of God is in everyone and for everyone. The problem is not everyone in the world is rooted in the grace of God. If it were, the Kingdom would be here. The world would be a perfect place. There would be no death, no brokenness, no sin, and everything would be nourished, sustained, supported and strengthened by the grace of God. One day that will happen. Our job as followers of Christ and the church is to spread our roots of love out to the world so that everyone can be rooted in the same loving and gracious God that created this world  so that everyone can experience that transforming love. And when that happens, Every will knee shall bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord!

Through various events, conversations and circumstances I believe God was directing me to lift up a specific message. Now, I believe the Holy Spirit is always guiding me when I prepare and deliver messages but I sensed Gods Spirit in a special way this week. So as we continue in our message series, Journey Through the Bible, Id like to lift up the message I feel led to share. And, not surprisingly, the message is heard loud and clear in the next section of the New Testament we are focusing on today, the Epistles (or letters). I dont think that is a coincidence. As we say, it is a God-incident. The Epistles make up most of the New Testament. In fact, 21 of the 27 books in the New Testament are letters from the Apostles. These are letters written to early Christian churches about understanding and living out the Christian faith. I am so glad they are in the New Testament because they help make the gospel of Jesus Christ concrete and practical for everyday living. They put legs to the gospel. Each letter was written to a specific church with a specific need. The Apostle Paul wrote most of these letters because he established many of the first Christian churches. A church would have a conflict, a need, a question, or an issue and write to Paul about it and Paul would write back offering advice, wisdom, instruction, and encouragement. Some of you may be wondering who Paul is. Well, Paul was a Jewish Pharisee who initially sought to suppress the Christian movement. However he was converted to Christ and became his greatest evangelist. He took the gospel across the Roman Empire, establishing churches everywhere he went. So what does all of this have to do with the message that God has put on my heart this week? Well, at the very heart of Pauls letters is the message that God has put on my heart. And, to be honest, if there was only one message about the Christian faith I would want you to hear it is the message I am going to give to you today. If you are new here and just curious about the Christian faith, this is an ideal message for you on what Christianity is all about. If you have been a Christian a long time, this message will remind you on why you became a Christian in the first place. Sometimes we forget that and when we forget that we can become lost. This message will bring you back home. And if you are someone who has ever wanted to know the contribution John Wesley and the United Methodist Church has made to the church and the Christian faith, this message will help you understand some of that that as well. The message on my heart and the message at the heart of Pauls letters is critical to a vital understanding and experience of God. However, the mistake I often make and many ministers make is assuming everyone knows and understands this message. But making that assumption is a huge mistake because todays message I believe is the cornerstone of our faith and the anchor that supports it. If we miss it, we miss everything. What is this important message? It is four words. These four words are referred to 127 times in the New Testament and 89 times in the letters of Paul. It is The Grace of God. Paul was so impacted by the grace of God that he lifts it up at the beginning of every one of his letters we find in the New Testament. The grace of God was that important to him and should be that important to us. The grace of God was the best Paul could wish his churches because the grace of God was the best thing he ever received and experienced. And I can tell you today the grace of God is the best thing I have ever received or experienced too! So what is the grace of God? Why is it so important? Well, the grace of God is the transforming influence of Gods love that is present and active in our lives. It is a love that unconditionally pardons and forgives us and it is a love that transforms us into vessels of Gods love in the world. Here are key passages of scripture from two of Pauls letters that underscore the power and significance of Gods grace: Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. Romans 5:1-2 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faithand this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God not by works, so that no one can boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 What do these verses mean? Get this. This is important. Gods grace, his forgiving and transforming love, is a gift from God. You cant earn it. You cant buy it. You cant work for it. And there is nothing you can do to obtain it. The only thing there is to do is receive it! Have faith in it and surrender to it. It is a gift. There is nothing you can do to make God love you less and there is nothing you can do to make God love you more. Thats the good news. Thats the gospel. Thats the message Jesus brought and embodied through his life, death and resurrection. Gods love for you is relentless and boundless. This is so important because, believe it or not, one of the things I run into all the time among people in the church, even people who have been in the church a long time, is that they think they can earn Gods love, they can work for it, they can buy or earn their way into heaven. They think that if they are a good person then God will love them and accept them. Folks, this is false. Gods grace is a gift. All we can do is receive it and experience it. That is the gospel folks! God loves you no matter what you have done and he forgives you of your sins. His grace can heal you and make you whole. Receive it and be transformed by him. Now Gods grace is not cheap grace. We just dont receive it and keep on living destructive lives. Gods grace loves and forgives us where we are but his grace does not keep us where we are. His grace empowers us to live the lives he has called us to do live. So how do we experience Gods grace? How does it work? Well, this is when the wisdom of John Wesley comes in. One day I will preach a sermon on John Wesley, who founded the Methodist Church. His intention was not to create a new denomination. He simply sought to reform and revive the Church of England in the 1700s. But through Wesleys inspired efforts the Methodist Church was born. His influence on the church and faith is powerful. One of his significant contributions to our faith was the way he explained how the grace of God works. His understanding of Gods grace is at the heart of the United Methodist Church. Wesley said that God initially makes his love and presence known to us through Prevenient Grace. Pre, meaning before. Basically this means that through Gods grace he initiates his transforming love into our lives. He presents it. He makes it known to us. He takes the first step. You could call it Initiating Grace or Enabling Grace. We have the free will to accept or reject it, but he presents it to us, makes it known to us. Jesus exemplified Gods prevenient grace by coming to this earth. God took that first step and came down to earth to seek and save the lost, to find the lost sheep, to find the lost coin, to draw the prodigal son back home. Jesus said he would draw all people to himself. Thats prevenient grace  God pulling and tugging on our hearts to turn away from sin, and turn to his love, grace and forgiveness, to give him our brokenness and have him make us whole. Look at how the Epistles describe the prevenient grace of God: Gods kindness is intended to lead you to repentance. Romans 2:4 For the grace of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to all people. Titus 2:11 We love because he first loved us. -1st John 4:19 You see, prevenient grace reminds us that God made the first move. We were his idea. He created us. He came down to earth. He died for us. He rose again for us. He seeks us. We are always responding to Gods gracious and loving promptings. Francis Thompson described Gods prevenient grace when he called God the Hound of Heaven. Infant Baptism is a wonderful expression of Gods prevenient grace. Many people wonder about why we baptize infants. I get that question a lot. Yes, the baby is clueless. Yes, the baby doesnt have any idea what is going on, and thats the point. God is saying to the child, I love you. You were my idea. I created you. I formed you. And I give you my love and grace. It is your gift. When you get old enough, you can decide to receive it. I hope you will. I will be trying to influence you to receive it, but it will be your decision. So many of us think that when we made the decision to follow Christ that we made the decision on our own. The truth is God did not force us but he did influence us. Those of you who are Christians know this. Just think about the people and events that led to your decision to follow Christ and you will see the hand of God at every turn. That was Gods prevenient, initiating and enabling grace at work! Maybe there are some of you here who are curious about the faith. You would not consider yourself a Christian but there is something inside of you that yearns to be in worship here. There is a voice inside of you that motivated you to come to worship today. There is something inside of you that wants to turn away from the things in life that dont satisfy and be loved by a transforming love. You had several choices this morning, but you chose to be here. I believe that is Gods prevenient grace. Jesus said, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door I will come in. Do you hear that knocking today? Just this week I spoke with a person I know pretty well who is hearing that knocking. In every conversation I had with this person in that past she expressed disdain for the church and her lack of belief in God. She has had a lot of pain in her life so you can understand her attitude. I ran into her recently and I almost collapsed when I heard what she told me. She said she had just experienced a miracle. It involved her finding an item she had lost. She said, I know only God could have done this. I couldnt believe my ears! She said, When it happened, there was a voice inside of me that said, See, I do exist. Believe in me. Then she said, I think I may go to church. I replied, I know a good one! Folks, thats Gods prevenient grace at work. Of course, Gods prevenient grace leads to something even more important, which I hope will be the case for the person I just mentioned: Gods justifying grace. Gods justifying grace is what many know as conversion or being born again. Gods justifying grace comes upon us when we turn away from sin and accept Gods gift of grace. When we do we are justified by God. What does that mean? When we choose to surrender to Gods grace, his transforming love forgives us and cleanses us of sin. His transforming love awakens the Spirit of God opens inside of us and gives us new life now and life eternal. We are transformed by Gods grace. We are healed, renewed and redeemed by Gods grace. Gods grace enables us to be vessels of his transforming love in the world. Here is the way some of the Epistles describe it. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. Romans 3:23-24 But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit. Titus 3:4-5 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! -2nd Corinthians 5:17 The experience of justifying grace is that moment when the prodigal son comes to himself runs home to his father and the father runs to him and throw his arms around his son. It is that moment when you were blind to the truth and then by some gift beyond yourself you see the truth and receive it. It is that event when you finally let go of all the baggage and weight and sin in your life that is dragging you down and realize that you cant do life on your own, that you need help, you need a Savior, you need a power greater than you give yourself to that power. It is that moment when you come to the place where you see that the promises of the world are empty and the only way you will be satisfied is by living the life of Christ and having him guide your life. It is coming to the place in your life when you finally realize that only the transforming love and grace of God will heal you of all your pain, sin, brokenness, and sadness. And you finally yield to that grace. Some people experience justifying grace in a dramatic way like Paul on the Damascus Road. For others it is a quiet but profound moment like John Wesley when his heart was strangely warmed. Still, for some, it is not a moment but rather an evolution of sorts. They grew up in the church and one day they just knew they had experienced that justifying grace. It is just part of who they are. If you are someone in worship today and you have never experienced Gods justifying grace, you can today. Perhaps the prevenient grace of God has led you here and you feel ready to embrace that grace and have it embrace you. Perhaps you have been in church your whole life and you never knew that this was what the grace of God was all about. Well, you "
Mar-22-2015-sermon,"There was Pol Pot in Cambodia, and at least forty beasts in Africa since the end of colonialism, including people like Idi Amin. In the Middle East there have been Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, Hosni Mubarak, and Bashar al-Assad. Many of these leaders had giant statues erected of themselves and plastered pictures of these leaders were found on the sides of buildings. What we read in Revelation about Rome has been repeated throughout history. In the United States, weve built in some safeguards to present a lot of thisrepresentative democracy. But, if we are honest there is still a tension we feel at times between the values of God and the values of our country. They are not always the same you know. Our form of government, our political parties, our economic system are all at odds sometimes with Gods kingdom. And sometimes when push comes to shove, Christians will choose civil religion rather than the Kingdom of God (Making Sense of the Bible). Of course on a more personal level the gods of money, sex and power always have the potential to destroy us. And we need to remember all of that leads to emptiness and only God can bring wholeness and satisfaction. In the end it is God who triumphs over all. So the real point of Revelation: Revelation does not tell us when and how the end will happen; it tells us that in the end none of our gods will be left standing. Only God Almighty will be triumphant. The gods of politics, nations, war, terror, evil and violence will be forever destroyed by God almighty. ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org I remember being at a friends house to have dinner and watch a movie.

For the last ten weeks we have taken a tour of the entire Bible looking at its major themes and characters. I hope this series has been helpful and inspiring to you. I also hope it has motivated you to read and study the Bible on your own and be transformed by it. We conclude our series, of course, with what is probably the most confusing book in the Bible  the book of Revelation. When we read it we feel like we have entered a strange and mysterious world. It is filled with weird images and symbols that confound us and sometimes scare us. As a result, many people just avoid it altogether. For some folks there is a big Keep Out sign on the last book of the Bible. I must admit when I was a younger Christian I did not read the book of Revelation very much. It didnt make much sense to me. And I didnt hear many sermons on the book either. I remember asking my minister at the time why I never heard any sermons on the book of Revelation. He said, People read and interpret the book in so many different ways that I feel I am better off just leaving it alone. Charley, when you preach on Revelation you either offend people or scare people. Perhaps you can understand that. You turn on the TV and hear a preacher say terrifying things about the book and it doesnt sit very well with you. You watch movies about the end of the world that quote Revelation and you are not sure what to think. You see documentaries making claims that Revelation contains a secret code and you wonder, Why should the book keep a secret? Maybe you dare enough to read some of Revelation and you see heads of beasts and numbers and battles and peculiar characters staring back at you and it feels more like a nightmare than scripture. Perhaps you are a Christian and a bit embarrassed by the book and you dont know what to say to your non-Christian friends when they ask, What is Revelation about anyway? Well, folks take heart. The book of Revelation is every easy to understand and it has a very hopeful message. For the next few minutes you are going to learn how easy the book is to understand. I also believe you will be encouraged by the inspired message it has for all of us. When you leave worship today you will understand what Revelation is all about and you will be able to tell others the books message in just two words. In order to understand any book of the Bible you must first ask these questions: Who wrote the book, to whom was it written and why was it written? Makes sense, right? Well, it is amazing how easy it to understand the books of the Bible once you know the answer to those three questions. And the book of Revelation is no different. When you know who wrote Revelation, to whom it was written and why it was written, the book is no longer confusing or intimidating. And, whats great is that we find the answer to all three of those questions in the very first chapter of the book! Take a look: John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. On the Lords Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, which said: Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea. Revelation 1:4-5, 9-11 So what do these verses tell us? The book of Revelation was written by a guy named John. It was not the Apostle John, but a prophet and early leader in the church named John. He wrote it around 95AD on an island called Patmos where he was a prisoner. Think of Patmos like the biblical version of Alcatraz, just a little prettier. Here is a picture of the island of Patmos. It is located 40 miles off the shore of Turkey. Why was John a prisoner on this island? Because he, along with other Christians and churches in Asia Minor, were being persecuted by the Roman government. They were being persecuted because they would not worship Caesar. They refused to say Caesar is Lord because they believed only Jesus Christ is Lord. The Roman government saw this as being disloyal to the state and therefore they persecuted and punished the early church. While John was on this island he felt inspired by God to write to seven churches in Asia Minor who were also being persecuted for their faith. He wanted to encourage them. He knew these churches well. You will see he listed each one. And he had a special message for each of them, but each message had one thing in common: stay faithful in the midst of the persecution. Dont compromise your faith in God because God is faithful. That was Johns message in a nutshell. Everything John writes in the book of Revelation addresses this message to those seven churches. Every symbol, every number, every beast and wild-eyed monster is about conveying to those seven churches not to compromise with the world but stay faithful to God in the midst of adversity. Therefore, what John was inspired to write was not meant to tell twenty-first-century Christians about the end times. Revelation is not a time-table for the end. Johns inspired words were written to encourage and challenge first-century Christians living in what is now Turkey to stop conforming to the culture around them and stop pledging allegiance to Rome and its gods but instead stay faithful to God almighty. For in the end, Rome would be defeated and Gods kingdom would prevail! But John knew the persecution and the temptation to compromise was strong. So the letter he needed to write would have to be different than other letters. It would have to stand out as powerful and evocative. It would need to convict and inspire in a special way. So what does John do? He uses a style of literature that was very popular within the early church, especially during persecution: Apocalyptic (meaning revelation). Apocalyptic literature was very popular because instead of using lectures, prose or poetry to communicate God and his power and love, it uses symbols and images of worship. It uses big caricatures and graphic descriptions to drive Gods message of truth home. It is transcendent language. So when you read Revelation, you have to switch gears to understand a different genre of literature. For example, in Revelation 17, the Roman Empire is described in a very provocative way: Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. The name written on her forehead was a mystery: BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES, AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of Gods holy people, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. Revelation 17:3-6 What a vivid picture of the Roman Empire and its persecution of the early church! Of course, not every symbol and description in Revelation symbolizes one particular thing. At times this is the case but not always. Just know that apocalyptic literature is a literature of crisis and warning. It is also transcendent language that comforts and worshipful language that showers praise to God Almighty. All this beautifully inspired transcendent language reveals the main conflict in Revelation: Declare your allegiance to Rome or declare your allegiance to God. You have to choose. You cant be loyal to both. Johns resounding message throughout Revelation is that God alone is worthy of our worship and pledging allegiance to Rome is simply idolatry. I love the places in Revelation where John describes the power and majesty of God and why he alone is worthy of our worship: Day and night without ceasing they sing, Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God the Almighty, who was and is and is to come. And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever; they cast their crowns before the throne, singing, You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created. Revelation 4:811 You see, throughout Revelation you see this continual contrast going on between the power and majesty of God and the diabolical nature of Rome. You must choose one. You cant worship both and only God is worthy of our worship. Of course in describing the evil of Rome John expresses one of the most well known images in Revelation -the mark of the beast: [He will] cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell who does not have the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: let anyone with understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a person. Its number is six hundred sixty-six. Revelation 13:15-18 This mark of the beast -666 -is very easy to understand. First its important to understand the number seven in Revelation. The number seven represents completeness, wholeness, or perfection. For example, the Holy Spirit is described as the sevenfold spirit. Jesus is described as a lamb with seven eyes and seven horns. Therefore, the number six is one less than perfectionit symbolizes imperfection, and 666 symbolizes utter imperfection. In Hebrew, Greek, and Latin letters represented numbers and vice versa. Many scholars have studied the correspondence of 666 in different language and have to the conclusion that, for John, it represented a figure who represented Rome at its most evil: Nero Caesar. Nero was the infamous emperor of Rome who had murdered leaders of the church in 65A.D. Nero committed suicide in 68 A.D. but many believed that he somehow came back to life to haunt them. The good news is that God triumphs over Rome and over all evil. Some of my favorite parts of Revelation are those inspiring passages that tell of Gods defeat of evil and the ultimate healing and transformation he will bring to human beings and the earth. Take a look at this passage: Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Look! Gods dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away. He who was seated on the throne said, I am making everything new! Then he said, Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true. He said to me: It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children. Revelation 21:1-7 So what does all of this mean for us today? Well, the message of Revelation, quite simply in two words is this: God Wins! God will be triumphant over evil, corruption, violence, nations, politics, etc. Therefore only God is worthy of our worship. Staying faithful to God means staying faithful to winning side. To bring it closer to home, Id like to note Adam Hamiltons interpretation of Revelation: Just like Rome in Revelation there is a temptation for the state to deify itself. And every nation has values and practices that are contrary to those of the kingdom of God. The state at times seeks to be worshipped and served. It doesnt always use those exact words but it demands the allegiance of the heart. And Gods people may be tempted to give in and compromise and to accept the states values. The question Revelation raises is, will you worship God or will you give your primary allegiance to the state? Think about the leaders throughout the ages who have often longed to be worshipped alongside the state. Stalin in the Soviet Union, Hitler and his Nazi Party, Franco in Spain, Mussolini in Italy. "
Mar-29-2015-sermon,"think being a Christian is but I believe it is being the hands and feet of Christ in this word. Following Jesus is about listening and doing. It is about putting into practice the things that Jesus taught. It is about a lifestyle of peace and justice (FollowingJesus.org). Its a way of being in the world that is marked by the sacrificial love that Jesus demonstrated for us. Following Jesus means remembering it is not power or violence or coercion or retaliation that will bring healing to this world; it is living a life empowered by Christ in service to Christ through sacrificial love. Jesus calls us to transform the world with his love. He calls us to spend our lives in the service of the least, the lost and the lonely. Following Jesus means following him outside of the walls of a church because thats where he is. It is found where people are hurting, where people are hungry, where people are oppressed, where people are denied justice, where people are dying (FollowingJesus.org). So the key questions we must ask ourselves this Palm Sunday is Am I an admirer of Jesus or a follower of Jesus? Am I fan or a follower? Am I only a worshipper of Jesus or am I a disciple of Jesus? When Bishop Will Willimon was the minister at Duke Chapel he received a phone call from a very upset parent. The father was upset because his graduate school bound daughter had just told him she was going to throw it all away, as he put it, and go and do mission work in Haiti. ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org The father said, This is up surd.

Didnt you let her go on all those youth retreats and ski trips? The father said, Well, yes... Willimon said, Then its your fault she believed all that stuff. Not mine.

Everyone has their own ideas about what it means to follow Jesus, some are good and some are bad. And many of us, as Christians, think we have a pretty good idea, but quite often we get it wrong. But the benefit of today and the rest of this week is that they make it very clear what it means to follow Jesus. So what I want to talk to you about today is what Palm Sunday and Holy Week teach us about following Jesus. Now, if you are not a Christian, and you are here because you are curious, I am glad you are here. You are always welcome here. I think todays message will help you make some sense out of Jesus and what we believe he calls Christians to do. Because, unfortunately, the church does not always do the best job following Jesus and so it can get rather confusing. I hope today will clear things up for you. A lot of folks think following Jesus means telling people if they dont believe in Jesus they are going to hell. Thats not following Jesus; thats just being mean and acting as if you know the mind of God. Thats called idolatry. A lot of people think that following Jesus means you can only be affiliated with a particular political party. Thats not following Jesus; thats obliterating the critical division between church and state. A lot of people think following Jesus means following rules and keeping your nose clean. Thats not following Jesus; thats following religion. A lot of people think following Jesus means being self-righteous and judgmental. Thats not following Jesus; thats just being hateful and annoying. And a lot of people think that following Jesus simply means giving your heart to him and keeping the rest of your life to yourself. Thats not following Jesus; thats disappointing Jesus. You see, the trouble is that many folks who have been in the church all their lives and who have considered themselves Christians for a long time either have forgotten what it means to follow Jesus or never grasped it in the first place. Therefore, is it any wonder why our non-Christian neighbors and co-workers do not get excited when they see us carrying our Bibles or talking about church? Not only are they often confused about who Christians are but what they often see from Christians isnt very attractive, fascinating or compelling. I felt this just the other night when I went to pick up dinner at a local restaurant. I had just finished teaching my Bible study and I was hungry. I didnt feel like cooking; I felt like having a greasy hamburger! So I walked in the restaurant to pick up my meal. And in this particular restaurant you pick up your to go meal at the bar. I got there before my meal was ready, so I waited next to the bar for my meal. I struck up a conversation with a few people at the bar. We made some jokes and laughed. One person began talking about his job at a hospital. I said, Oh, thats a good hospital. I visit folks there from time to time. What do you do? he asked. I replied, Oh, Im a ministerPasadena Community Church. Complete silence. Everyone within earshot began looking at the floor. The laughter stopped. The banter stopped. One man was brave enough to break the silence by saying, If I went into a church I think the roof would fall down. I said, No it wouldnt! The church is a hospital for sinners not a museum for saints. Pasadena is a warm and welcoming church. Our doors are open for you anytime. He looked at me as if he didnt believe me. Now, granted, a lot folks have their baggage about ministers and churches and Christians. But the question I have is Why? And why didnt the man at the bar believe me? Because we have lost sight of what it means to follow Jesus. For if everyone who calls themselves Christian truly followed Jesus I believe churches would be filled with people who would want to know more about Jesus! We sometimes forget that the Christian faith initially grew and spread like wildfire not by coercion, but by fascination. People were so fascinated by these folks who were following Jesus they had to know more about the person they were following. Why were they so fascinated? What made them want to know more about Jesus followers and the person they were following? Well, we are going to find out today. Because what Jesus really calls his followers to do is so revolutionary and radical that if every Christian did it the whole world would be fascinated and drawn to Jesus Christ. But I will warn you. Truly following Jesus and doing what he calls us to do isnt easy. In fact, sometimes it can get you into trouble. It can hurt you. It is not glamorous. Its often messy. It will not win you any popularity contests. Thats why so many of us as Christians fall short. Following Jesus requires a great deal from each of us. But following Jesus is the most important and fulfilling thing you can do with your life because it means helping him transform this world. So what does it mean to follow Jesus? Well, just days preceding Jesus Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem he was very clear about what it means to be his follower. Lets take a look: He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again. He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. Mark 8:31-32 Now why did Peter rebuke Jesus? Because he along with many others wanted Jesus to be a militant messiah who would slay the wicked, take over Rome and lift up the truly righteous. When Jesus began talking about dying and defeat, Peter said, This is crazy talk! Stop being down on yourself. You have the power of God on your side. Youre not going to die. With your power we will take down Rome and set things right. Justice will be served and your will be our king and we revel in the glory in your kingdom as your right hand men! Jesus was not pleased. Here is his response to Peter: But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. Get behind me, Satan! he said. You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.  Mark 8:33 Whoa! Jesus said, Peter, do you still not get it? Do the rest of you still not get it? Get your head in the game! Do you still not understand what I am about  what God sent me here to do and what I am calling you to do? And I think Jesus would say that to the many of his followers today, You are completely wrapped up in your own concerns. You think you are following me but you are not. You have forgotten the concerns of God! What are the concerns of God? Jesus tells us: Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it. Mark 8:34-35 Okay Jesus, we want to follow you. We want to be your disciples! What do you want us to do? We will do anything Huh? Deny myself? What? Take up a cross? Save my life and lose it? Lose my life and save it? Jesus, are you talking in riddles here? We dont get it! We thought we were following you into a revolution, and we would reign with you in power! Now youre telling us to be losers? What are you talking about? The disciples still not get what it meant to be Jesus followers. They had been with him for quite awhile and still did not get it. Well, they continued traveling with Jesus and as he taught it finally began to sink in what was going to happen to him when he got to Jerusalem. He had to tell them three different times. But they still not understand their role as followers. In fact, just before they entered Jerusalem James and John asked Jesus the most ludicrous thing! Its going to surprise you: Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. Teacher, they said, we want you to do for us whatever we ask. What do you want me to do for you? he asked. They replied, Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory. You dont know what you are asking, Jesus said. Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with? We can, they answered. Mark 10:35-39 They still thought following Jesus was about what they could get  the benefits, the power, the glory, being recognized and honored. And how often are we guilty of the same thing? I will follow you Jesus as long as you do what I ask you to do. I will follow you because I know it gets me into heaven. I will follow you so you can take care of my needs, fulfill my desires and make me successful. However, Jesus speaks plainly to them and to us by explaining exactly what it means to follow him and where real life is found: Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. Mark 10:43-45 Translation from Jesus: Okay, Im going to spell it out for you. You want to be great in Gods eyes. You want to be great in the kingdom of heaven. You want to find real life and you want to know what real life is? Put others above yourself and serve them. Put the needs of others above your own. Give away every part of yourself to God and his people. Give up control and let God serve through you. Let go of what is most precious to you and replace it with love of God and love of others. Insist on being the last in line, give away your seat, and think of others before you think of yourself. Find the least, last and lost and help them. Are you ready to do that? Because thats what it means to be my followers. And in just a few days Jesus would demonstrate the most profound expression of putting others above himself. It was a selfless act of love that transformed the world. So what do we learn from all of this? What does it mean to follow Jesus? Following Jesus means living a life of sacrificial love. It means experiencing Gods love and expressing that love sacrificially in the world. You see, folks it is only by understanding the sacrificial love of Christ that we can understand what Palm Sunday really means and the profound impact of Jesus triumphal entry. Lets look at the story again: When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, Hosanna!  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest heaven! Church tradition calls this Jesus triumphal entry but it was the exact opposite. Many scholars believe that Jesus entry into Jerusalem was a form of protest against the power and violence of Rome. In fact, it is believed by some scholars that Pontius Pilate entered Jerusalem on the same day with great pomp and circumstance and shouts of praise. He was there to Lord his power over the people during Passover so they would not get any ideas. He would have come in on a Stallion as if to say, I come in power! I come in power! Thats what many wanted Jesus to do. But instead Jesus made a satire out of it. He protested it by coming in on a donkey as if to say, I do not come in power. I do not come to force or coerce. I come in love. I come in mercy. I come to show that the only power that will transform this world is the transforming power of Gods sacrificial love. Of course, most of the crowd who praised Jesus that day didnt really have a clue what Jesus was about to do. Take a look at what occurred after the parade: Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. Mark 11:7-11 Now thats anticlimactic, isnt it? They just held this great parade Jesus and he didnt address them. Didnt thank them. Didnt teach them. Didnt entertain them or perform miracles for them. He simply left the crowd, spent some time in the Temple praying and thinking about what he had to do and then left. Why didnt he do anything? Why didnt he acknowledge the crowd? Because he knew that most of the crowd that day wasnt really prepared to do what he was calling them to do. He knew that in just a few days many of them would be yelling Crucify Him! That crowd should cause us to take a hard look at our hearts. You see, we can believe in Jesus and shout Hosanna. We can worship and adore Jesus. We can praise his name. We can invite him into our hearts and accept him as our Lord and Savior. We can do all that and still not be willing to follow him. We can believe that Jesus is the Son of God and still live selfish lives, ignore the cries of the least, last and lost and demonstrate hatred toward people of other races, cultures, or even those who have different political views than us. You see, it is critical that we receive Christ as Lord and Savior and develop a personal relationship with him. It is critical that we get rooted in a local church. But these things are food for the journey. They provide nourishment to us as we serve Christ in the world. Yes we are saved by Christ, but we are saved for something. And that something is to be his hands and feet in the world. I dont know what you "

For the last several weeks we have been taking a tour through the entire Bible, highlighting its main themes. We are now in the New Testament. Last week we focused on the four gospels and learned in Matthew that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Old Testament. In Mark, Jesus is the crucified God. In Luke, Jesus seeks and saves the lost. In John, Jesus Christ gives life to those who believe. Today we focus on the powerful story of the beginning of the early church  the profound ripple effect of Jesus upon the church. And we find this story in the fifth book of the New Testament, The Acts of the Apostles. The book of Acts was written by the author of the gospel of Luke. Think of Acts as Luke, Part Two, and the Acts of the Apostles! I told you about the power of Jesus. Now hear the story of how the power and spirit of Christ empowered the church to change the world. The first chapter deals with Jesus resurrection and ascension. The second chapter is about the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came upon the church and empowered it for ministry. The rest of the book tells the profound story of how the church of Jesus Christ began to transform the world with the gospel. It highlights the ministry of the Apostles Peter and Paul and their influence on the early church. The major theme of the book of Acts is the work of the Holy Spirit through the church in spreading the gospel from the Jews centered in Jerusalem to the Gentiles throughout the Roman Empire. In chapter after chapter you find the Apostles and the church teaching, preaching and healing and bringing thousands to Christ. You find the church doing amazing and wondrous things in the name of Christ. Its inspiring! In fact, as Jesus ascended to heaven, he said these words to his disciples: But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. Acts 1:8 What follows in Acts is the epic story of how that happened. But the question I want to focus on today is how did it happen? How did the early church find that power of Christ? How did Peter, Paul, and the early church do all the amazing things that they did? How were they able to heal and grow and transform civilization with the gospel? These are questions that I ask. And I know it is a question that many Christians ask! We read Acts and get inspired by what the early church did and then we think: Wait a second! The same power that was available to them is available to us! The same spirit that empowered them is available to us! Why cant the church today have that same influence and power? Why cant we continue to transform the world like the early church? If we have that same spirit and power then why is the mainline church dying? If we have that same spirit and power then why do we feel like just a nonprofit most of the time? The answer to that question is simple but difficult for many people to hear. But Im going to tell you the answer because I think this church can handle it. Now those of you who are visiting today and are new to the church, youre off the hook with what I am about to say. I am glad you are here and I hope you come back. I also hope you find this church to be the kind of church you want to be a part of. I love this church and I believe you will love it too. But I need to speak to those folks here who have committed themselves to this church. The reason why the early church was filled with such power and was able to do the amazing things it was able to do was because the disciples and the early church felt the burden of responsibility as followers of Christ. They knew that Christ was holding them responsible for spreading the gospel and changing the world. Yep, it is that simple. The problem with much of the church today is that it is not convicted by that sense of responsibility from Christ. In fact, much of the church today sees membership in a church like the promise of having an American Express Card, Membership has its Privileges. For many folks who join the church it is about the privileges they will receive -salvation, fellowship with nice people, Bible studies and messages that feed them, programs and dinners that satisfy their families. And folks there is nothing wrong with any of those things. Certainly, those things come with joining a church. But being a member of the church of Jesus Christ is not about receiving privileges; it is about accepting the responsibility that comes with following Jesus Christ. If you join a church just for you can get out of it, you are joining for the wrong reasons. I have a friend who is a District Superintendent. A D.S. is someone who oversees and supervises a district of churches. We got to talking one day about her job as a D.S. She said that 80 percent of her job is dealing with churches in conflict. She was exasperated and said, We have forgotten the mission and purpose of the church! So many people in the church think it is about them, about what they want! No wonder our denomination is dying. The moment churches care more about their own needs than the needs of the world is the moment those churches begin to die. It would be a good idea for this church and any church, when in conflict, to ask What does this have to do with making disciples, with bringing help and hope to the worldwith reaching the least, the last and the lost? If the conflict is not relevant to serving Jesus, it is a waste of the churchs precious time. Now, the good news is that our church understands our mission and does a great job living it out, but Im preaching this message because it is so easy to forget! In this consumer culture we live in it is so easy to turn the church into a religious Wal-Mart, catering to everyones whims and fancies. It is so easy to become a church with Burger King theology, Have it your way! instead of living it out the way of Christ in the world  dying to self, serving, giving up control, loving our enemies, giving sacrificially, and making disciples. The early church we see in Acts saw only their responsibility as followers of Christ, nothing else. Folks, membership in the church has it responsibilities. Our vision statement says, Serve Christ by serving others and sharing your witness. How are you doing with that? When you joined this church, you took a vow to support Christ and his church with your prayers, presence, gifts, service and witness. Membership has its responsibilities. I want to lift up our first responsibility on the list  Prayer. There is a reason it is lifted first because prayer is the cornerstone to the life of a Christian and the life of the church. We see this all over the book of Acts. The power of prayer is mentioned 32 times in Acts! You want to know how and why the early church served with such power? Because they were always praying for God to give them that power! Take a look at what happened just before the Holy Spirit came upon the church at Pentecost. We think it just happened. No, look at what preceded it: They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. Acts 1:14 Then Peter got up to preach the gospel and the Holy Spirit came upon the church. They prayed and it happened! 3,000 people came to Christ that day! Later we find Peter and John healed a man and were arrested and were brought before religious leaders. They asked, By what power did you heal this man?! Peter and John told them it was by the power of Jesus. Well, they eventually let them go because a mob of people were praising God for what they had done! And when they got back together with the church, what did they do? They prayed: Now, Lord, enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus. After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly. Acts 4:29-31 Later in Acts Peter was arrested by King Herod. Herod could not stand the church and wanted to persecute Peter badly. So he threw him into prison and Herod appointed 16 soldiers to guard Peter! When the church found out about it, what did they do? They prayed! Look at what happened: So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him. The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance. Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. Quick, get up! he said, and the chains fell off Peters wrists. Then the angel said to him, Put on your clothes and sandals. And Peter did so. Wrap your cloak around you and follow me, the angel told him. Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision. They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him. Acts 12:5-10 Here is one more when Peter was called to the bed side of Tabitha, a faithful lady who had died. Look at what the power of prayer did in this story: Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying  Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, Tabitha, get up. She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up. He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers, especially the widows, and presented her to them alive. This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord. -Acts 9:39-42 You may say, Come on! Really? That didnt really happen. Well, have you ever really prayed for God to give you the power and resources to serve him? I dont know anyone who has prayed to God for the power to do his will in the world who has ever been disappointed. There is an old saying, The devil laughs at our intellect, yawns at our spirituality, doesnt worry about our efforts, but trembles when we pray. Folks, there is power in prayer. Prayer is the cornerstone to our faith and the cornerstone to a vital church. Why? Because prayer is all about our relationship with Christ, connecting to his Spirit, drawing on his power, being guided by his wisdom! Prayer is essential, and everything powerful we do as individual Christians and the church always begins and ends with prayer. This is why our very first responsibility as members of the church is to pray. The church in Cuba is experiencing great revival. It looks a lot more like the church in Acts than the church in America does. And, of course, we are falling over ourselves trying to duplicate what they are doing. I have been in meetings where folks were trying to figure out their strategy. What is their secret? In one of these meetings, Aldo Martin, a Cuban minister in our conference, said, You want to know why the church in Cuba is on fire? It is because the church in Cuba has been praying for revival for years! It began with prayer. It is the same way with the church in Africa! They are on fire too and experiencing great revival. A friend of mine, Allen Johnson, serves a church in Ocala. In his church he has a missionary who serves in Africa. Allen asked him one day why the church is exploding in Africa. He replied, We get up and pray every day, Lord, what do you want me to do and how do you want me to do it? Frazier Memorial United Methodist Church in Montgomery, Alabama was once one of the fastest growing Protestant churches in America. It had around 10,000 members and tons of ministries. They gave over 50 percent of their budget to mission work! Imagine having a budget like that! You want to know how that tremendous growth got started. They first built a prayer chapel in the middle of the church campus and they prayed God would bless the church. And God did! It all started with prayer! Several years ago St. James United Methodist Church in Tampa acquired a big piece of property. They relocated their church and made plans to build a new sanctuary. They needed one million dollars to do it. At the time a million dollars could build a sanctuary. So, what did they do? Did they start by putting together a slick fund raising campaign? No, the pastor at the time called a special council meeting and said, I have called you here because we need a million dollars and I want us to spend some time in prayer to God. The next Sunday instead of preaching his sermon, he said, We need a million dollars and I want us to use this time to be in prayer before the Lord. Guess what? They got the money and built the sanctuary. At the end of last year, we were behind in our budget. We were wringing our hands trying to get through without making cuts and compromising ministries. Andrea Henning, a saint in our church, showed up with little sticky notes for each of us, "
May-10-2015-sermon,"and look over their strategic plan for raising a healthy child in 18 years! Great mothers simply do what they can with great love one day at a time. They feed, listen, discipline and play with love. Sometimes it is difficult and tedious but they keep doing it each day. They do what they can. And their small acts of great love eventually lead to the raising of a child. If mothers thought about all they would have to do for 18 years at once it would be impossible. But each day doing what they can with great love leads to the fulfillment of one of the greatest callings in the world  being a mother. Small acts done with great love eventually lead to great big things. A Church goer wrote a letter to the editor of a newspaper and complained that it made no sense to go to church every Sunday. Ive gone for 30 years now, he wrote, and in that time I have heard something like 3,000 sermons. But for the life of me, I cant remember a single one of them. So, I think Im wasting my time and ministers are wasting theirs by giving sermons at all. This started a real controversy in the Letters to the Editor column. Much to the delight of the editor, it went on for weeks until someone wrote this clincher: Ive been married for 30 years now. In that time my wife has cooked some 32,000 meals. But, for the life of me, I cannot recall the entire menu for a single one of those meals.But I do know this They all nourished me and gave me the strength I needed to do my work. If my wife had not given me these meals, I would be physically dead today. Likewise, if I had not gone to church for nourishment, I would be spiritually dead today! When we simply do what we can for Jesus with great love those little things can lead to great big things.

Louisville police officer Bill Mayo pulled over the youngest perpetrator of his career this week: a 2 year-old boy named Jaxon. Jaxon loves his toy car, and when his mother, Ashley Crawford, saw that a local police officer was tending to a small car wreck on her street, she asked if he could do her a favor and pull up with the lights on behind her son. Officer Mayo was happy to play along. I saw this little boy who looked to be not much older than my son, and he was running up and down the street like my son does and he just made me smile, Mayo tells Yahoo Parenting. He had this Little Tikes car, and his mom asked if she could snap some pictures. I would never say no to a boy like that. He kept looking up at me like I was some kind of Transformer. He kept smiling. Jaxon and Mayo spent about 20 minutes together, playing hide-and-go-seek and exchanging high-fives and hugs, Crawford says. He went above and beyond just so my son would smile, she says. I think it's important to see that police officers aren't people you should be scared of. They are the people you should turn to for help. But Mayo says he was the lucky one. I probably got just as much out of the interaction as Jaxon did. It made my day complete, he says. I'm just a big kid as it is. In a child's world, make believe and pretend is what it's all about. I would do it a thousand times over"" (sunnyskyz.com). All Jesus asks of us is that we do what we can for him with great love.

If we are honest, we all have the desire to impress people. We want to be liked, accepted, recognized and so we often spend a lot of time and energy trying to impress others. But a life spent impressing people is exhausting and miserable because we often compromise who God created us to be. We have two choices: we can spend our lives impressing others or impressing Jesus. But we cant do both. Real life is found when we spend our lives impressing Jesus. At the end of our lives we are not going to be thinking about all the ways we succeeded or failed at impressing others. We will be thinking about all the ways we succeeded or failed at impressing Jesus. Those will be the moments that matter. Those will be the moments that count. The gospels provide several fascinating accounts of Jesus encountering people who really impressed and amazed him. So for the next few weeks we are going to take a look at these encounters and learn from them. I hope this series motivates all of us to dedicate our lives to impressing Jesus because that is the only life worth living. So far we have looked at three people who really impressed Jesus: A poor widow who risked everything for God, a pagan centurion who expected Jesus to act, and last week Sidney did a fabulous job lifting up Mary who made spending time with Jesus a priority. Today we focus on another woman who impressed Jesus. Isnt it interesting that three out of the four people who impressed Jesus so far in this series were women? That shouldnt surprise any of us. Well the woman we focus on today not only impressed Jesus but deeply moved him. In fact, Jesus said it was an act the world would never forget. Heres the fascinating thing  according to everyone elses standards what this woman did was foolish, wasteful, careless, and caused the disciples to get very angry. Just goes to show you that what often moves Jesus makes the world angry. Yet if we look deeper into the story of this woman we will find a liberating truth that has the potential to move our faith to the next level. This truth also has the potential to move our church to the next level of growth and ministry. Yes, its that powerful! Are you not happy with where you are as a Christian? Do you want to grow more as a Christian? Do you want to grow closer to God? Do you ever find yourself wishing you could do more for Jesus and the church but you never seem to get there, you never seem to get around to it? Do you ever make promises to yourself and to others about doing more for Jesus but you always seem to break those promises and then you feel so guilty about it that you never make promises again? If you or someone you know feels this way, this message is for you! Because todays message can empower you to be the kind of Jesus follower you always wanted to be. As a pastor, I come across many people who get excited about their faith. They join the church. They love God and want to get closer to him. They have big dreams about what they can do for God. They sign up for this and they sign up for that. And then two months later they stop coming to church on a regular basis. They stop coming to Bible study. They stop showing up to serve. Sometimes I come across their names or pictures in the office and I think, I wonder what happened to them? They were so excited about their faith and becoming active in the church. Well, I know what happened to them. They lost their steam and excitement. They lost their sense of commitment. Other interests in life distracted them and pulled them away. These are not bad people because the truth is it can happen to all of us. Sometimes it happens to me! I am not on fire to do ministry 100 percent of the time. Most of the time I am, but there are also times when I need to rekindle my fire. My faith and commitment need to be renewed. So how do we prevent the fire from going out or if it does go out how do we find that, passion, motivation and commitment again? Well, Im here to tell you folks that todays message gives us the answer. Todays message can renew your faith and commitment to Christ. Todays message can start that fire for God again in your soul. And the truth is the message is not complicated. In fact, it is deceptively simple. You are just one act a way from taking your faith to the next level. So lets get after it. This womans story appears in the gospel of Mark. She encounters Jesus when the religious leaders are starting to plot to kill him. Judas is about to betray him. Tensions are high. Things are starting to come to a boil for Jesus. In the midst of this time Jesus decides to get away from the chaos for a little while by having dinner at a friends house. What happens at this dinner Jesus would never forget and the world would remember forever. Lets take a look: While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. Mark 14:3 So here is Jesus reclining at the table, enjoying conversation, waiting for Simon to finish grilling the ribeyes. All of a sudden a woman appears and approaches Jesus. We dont know who she was. She may have been the caterer. She may have been a friend of Simons invited to the dinner party. She may have been hired by Simon to sing while they ate. We dont know. But one thing we know is that she approached Jesus with an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume. Here is a picture of an alabaster jar from the time of Jesus. It was a jar made of unique stone that is translucent. And these jars often held expensive perfumes and oils. Well, the lady at the dinner party had one of these jars filled with a fragrant oil called nard. Nard is still used today as a calming fragrance. This lady broke the jar and poured all of the perfume on Jesus head while he was at the dinner table. She just walked up to Jesus while he was eating his steak, broke the jar, and poured the perfume all over him. Now why? That seems weird doesnt it? If someone did that to me, Id be a little ticked. That oil takes forever to wash off and it smells weird. I would no longer smell my delicious steak. Instead I would smell pungent perfume. Why would she do this? Well, lets continue the story: Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, Why this waste of perfume? It could have been sold for more than a years wages and the money given to the poor. And they rebuked her harshly. Mark 14:4-5 The people around the table that night must have been Jesus finance committee! They were appalled at what the woman did, not just because it was strange but because they knew how expensive the perfume was. And she dumped the whole darn thing on Jesus. All that perfume was worth a years salary! Scholars estimate that in our terms the perfume was worth about 1,000 dollars. So, in essence, this woman dumped a thousand dollars worth of perfume on Jesus. The followers of Jesus around him that night got angry and criticized the woman. Can you blame them? All that money could have fed thousands of people. And you just completely wasted it. What a gross display of waste. We could have sold the perfume and given money to the poor or to missions, and you wasted it. So how did Jesus respond? What did he think of this womans wasteful act? Well, he wasnt angry about it. Far from it. He was deeply moved. Take a look: Leave her alone, said Jesus. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. Mark 14:6-7 Jesus didnt think what the woman did was wasteful, careless, foolish or strange. He thought it was beautiful. This woman knew more than anyone at the dinner party that night. She knew that Jesus was not going to be around much longer. She knew there would always be time to help those in need, but there would not always be time to care for Jesus. And so she did the most loving thing she was able to do for Jesus. She poured an extravagant amount of fragrant perfume on him. Still strange though, isnt it? Why did Jesus think it was beautiful? Wouldnt a nice thank you letter be more practical? Perhaps take Jesus and the disciples out to dinner to thank them. Maybe give Jesus a pocket knife with his initials on it? Nope. She chose to pour expensive perfume on Jesus and he thought what she did was loving and beautiful. Why? Well, Jesus tells us why: She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. Mark 14:8 Why did this woman move Jesus so much? Because she did the only thing she was able to do for Jesus. She didnt have much money. She didnt have power. She probably couldnt read or write. The most precious thing she had was a jar of perfume on her dresser. Maybe she found it. Maybe it was a gift from a relative. But she took it and performed a respectful Jewish custom for the dead on Jesus. She covered his body with a sweet smell for the grave. She did the only thing she was able to do but she did it with great love and it moved Jesus. Thats why it was beautiful. In fact, it moved Jesus so much that he said the most outlandish thing in the world about it! Take a look: Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her. Mark 14:9 Can you believe that? Jesus said that what this woman did would make history. He guaranteed this story would always be told when the gospel is preached. And here we are today in 2015 hearing about this woman! So here is the big question. Why did Jesus give that much praise to someone like this? We dont even know her name! We dont know who she was. Why did Jesus praise a woman who did such a simple act? Because of five of the most important words in the text: She did what she could. The woman simply did what she could for Jesus. She simply gave Jesus what she had. Why is this important? Because doing what we can for Jesus is often the last thing we care to do. You see, this is often what prevents people from serving Jesus more. This is often what causes people to lose their fire. This is often what causes people to become apathetic. Its too easy to get frustrated about what is not being done or cant be done for Jesus than it is to just do what can be done. Sometimes we just get stuck thinking about what we wish we could do, hope we could do for Jesus, dream we could do for Jesus, instead of simply doing what we can for Jesus. Its easier and more romantic to sit in a room and dream dreams of changing our community for Christ than it is to show up and feed the poor or teach a Sunday school class. Its much easier and more romantic to come up with a plan to double our worship attendance than it is to walk across the street and invite our neighbor to church. Its much easier to think about how much this awful world needs Jesus than it is to get to know that guy at work with a shady past who just wants someone to listen. Its much easier and more romantic to talk about how important prayer is than it is to set aside ten minutes each day and pray. Its easier to talk about how important it is to give and tithe to the church than it is to give some of that extra income we earned to the church instead of to the movie theatre or shopping mall. Doing what we can for Jesus is often the last thing we care to do and this is what is crippling the church and keeping Christians from doing more and growing more. If we as Christians and we as the church would just concentrate and what we can do and do it, we cant imagine the difference we could make in this world and what a difference it would make to our faith. This is why Jesus praised this woman. It was not because she did something spectacular or powerful or amazing. It was because she simply took what she had to give and did what she could for Jesus. She didnt waste time thinking about the resources or gifts she wished she had to give to Jesus. She just took a jar of perfume and said, I will show Jesus how much I love him with this. I will just give him my best. And that simple act done with great love moved Jesus. All Jesus asks of us is that we do what we can with great love. Jesus is not impressed with critics or dreamers. Jesus is not impressed with elaborate plans and strategies. Jesus is not impressed with a lot of talk. Jesus is not impressed with hours and hours of meetings. Jesus is impressed with action. Just read the gospels. Nowhere do I read that Jesus and the disciples had a committee meeting. Now, dont get me wrong. Meetings have their place. But so often the church replaces action with meetings and a bunch of talk. Jesus is impressed with action. Today is Mothers Day and I cant think of a greater example of what I am talking about than what mothers and mother figures do with great love every day. Mothers dont wake up every morning "
May-17-2015-sermon,"us to be weak, co-dependent people? No! It means we make God the source of our strength and joy. We make him the guiding light of our lives. We give him the drivers seat. We surrender all that we have all that we are to him. You see, so often in our independence and stubbornness, we do the best we can and leave the rest to God. And there is nothing left for God! Or what is left is not our best. We have taken it. We do and do and then pray, Bless this, Lord. We do it backwards. And then we wonder why we dont have the power we need for living. We wonder why we are frustrated and lack joy. We must do the exact opposite. Instead of doing the best we can and leaving the rest to God, we need to be giving it all to God and then doing the best we can! Thats what it means to live depending on God. See the difference! I have learned this truth and it is one you can take to the bank: The more we depend on God the more dependable we find he is! The problem is so often we never depend on God long enough to find out how dependable he really is. I like how Rick Warren puts it: Every day you have a choice whos going to be in control of your life  you or God. That choice is a battle. There are things in your life that you want to control. You want to make your own rules. But finding peace and power begins with letting God be God. It always starts with saying, God, Im giving up control, because you can control the things that are out of control in my life. I dont know what youre going to face this week. You dont, either. But I can already tell you what God wants you to do: Let go, and know. Let go of control, and know that God is in control. Let go, and know! This is the first step to serenity in your life.

It was written by Reinhold Neibuhr, a great American theologian: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference. Whats fascinating is that most people do not know the rest of Niebuhrs prayer: Living one day at a time, enjoying one moment at a time, accepting hardship as a pathway to peace, taking as Jesus did this sinful world as it is, not as I would have it; trusting that you will make all things right if I surrender to your will so that I may be reasonably happy in this life and supremely happy with you forever in the next. Amen. Thats where the power is! There is power when you surrender to God the very things youve been trying to take control. Imagine waking up every day and saying to the Lord, Youre in charge. What do you want me to do today? Show me and I will do it. Life and ministry would flow so much better. We would have more power for living. I close with a passage from Isaiah that I remember when I am trying to control my life: For I am the LORD your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.

We have a simple choice. We can spend our lives impressing others or impressing Jesus but we cant do both. Real life is found when we spend our lives impressing Jesus. At the end of our lives we are not going to be thinking about all the ways we succeeded or failed at impressing others. We will be thinking about all the ways we succeeded or failed at impressing Jesus. Those will be the moments that matter. Those will be the moments that count. The gospels provide several fascinating accounts of Jesus encountering people who really impressed and amazed him. So for the next few weeks we are going to take a look at these encounters and learn from them. I hope this series motivates all of us to dedicate our lives to impressing Jesus because that is the only life worth living. So far we have looked at four people who really impressed Jesus: A poor widow who risked everything for God, a pagan centurion who expected Jesus to act, Mary, who made spending time with Jesus a priority and last week we looked at a woman who moved Jesus by a simple act done with great love. Today we turn our attention not to an individual but to a group of people who made an impression on Jesus. This group impressed Jesus so much that he said they embodied everything he taught about God. Jesus never said that about anyone or any other group of people! He was often disappointed in the disciples with their lack of faith and inability to grasp what he taught. He criticized the religious leaders for missing everything that he taught. And he warned much of the crowd who wanted to follow him that they really didnt have any idea what it meant to follow him. But the group we are going to look at today, well, Jesus felt they nailed it. Their lives and example reflected what Jesus sought to teach the world. In fact, Jesus was so impressed with them that he said they were the benchmark for understanding God and life. And he said if we are serious about following him we would do well to follow their example. Thats high praise from the King of Kings and Lord of Lords! So here is the promise of todays message. If we follow the example of this group that impressed Jesus so much, we can experience more of the power of God in our lives. Does that sound good? I know it does to me. Because I dont know about you, but I need all the help I can get! And I imagine you do too! Im sure there are some of you who feel like life is an uphill battle every day. Your relationships, your work, your personal issues, they all feel like hard fought battles everyday and you are exhausted. Or maybe you have hit a wall in your life spiritually or emotionally and you dont know how to break through it. Perhaps your marriage or career feels stuck and you have tried and tried and tried to find your way out and it seems impossible. You want more power. You need more power in your life. And you are like, God, a little help here! I need some help! Do something! I feel like I am doing everything by myself! There have been plenty of times in my life when I have felt that way. Ive been there. Its no fun. You look around and see folks living effortlessly and you think, What am I doing wrong? I am praying every day. No, I am begging God every day. Im going to church. Im trying to be nice to people. Im trying really hard. Im doing the best I can and I still feel like I am swimming upstream all the time! At one point in my life when I felt this way, I learned a powerful lesson about faith that turned things around completely for me. Well, I guess I should say I relearned it. I learned it a long time ago but forgot it, much to my regret. But when I relearned this lesson and began to apply it I immediately began to feel more of Gods power in my life. Now, I am not saying I am perfect. There are times when I forget to apply the lesson and I get into a rut again. But whenever I get into that rut of feeling powerless, I remember and apply this lesson and it always gets me back on track. I feel and experience more of Gods power and life seems effortless to me. And you can experience the same thing if you simply apply this lesson. So you have a choice today: You can ignore the lesson and stay in the rut you are in today or you can apply this lesson and feel the power of God in your life and find the strength and answers you need to move forward in life. So what is the lesson? Well, it is the lesson we discover by observing a group of people who really impressed Jesus. Their example is all we need and I want to lift it up today. Now, let me say that the passage of scripture we are about to study will be very familiar to many of you. The problem is that because it is so familiar many of us have never taken the time to really understand the profound wisdom in this passage of scripture. So lets take the time today. This time will be time well spent. I promise you that. Lets take a look. It appears in Mark 10: People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them Mark 10:13 So Jesus is teaching and preaching. Everyone is clamoring for his attention. I am sure it was overwhelming. And there comes a point when a bunch of parents show up with their kids because they want Jesus to bless their children. Rabbis did that back then. They would pronounce blessings on children, much like we do when we baptize babies. So when parents heard Jesus was around, they rounded up their children and headed to see Jesus! You cant blame these parents! If you had children back then and knew there was an opportunity for Jesus to bless them, you would do everything you could to get them to Jesus! So these parents show up with children of all ages, from infants to those 12 years of age. I am sure some mothers approached Jesus with their infants, wanting to place the babies in his arms. Kids were running around all over the place, making noise. Babies were crying. Toddlers were crawling away from mom. Kids were telling mom they needed to use the bathroom. It was chaos. So the disciples saw all this going on around Jesus and they tried to put a stop to it. Take a look: but the disciples rebuked them. Mark 10:13 The disciples didnt like this at all, so they told the parents and kids to go away. Now, over the years the disciples have gotten a bad rap from this text. They have been wrongly characterized as not liking children, Get those kids out of here. They should be seen and not heard! This is no place for kids! Well, thats not really fair. The spirit of this text shows us that the disciples were not child haters; they simply wanted to protect Jesus. People were pulling at Jesus from all directions all the time. And at this point in his ministry the shadow of the cross loomed large before him. He had a lot on his mind and had a lot of things he needed to say. The disciples didnt want Jesus to be bothered. They were trying to be Jesus protectors. But regardless, Jesus was not pleased with the disciples at all. Take a look: When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them -Mark 10:14 Jesus got angry with the disciples for trying to stop the children from coming to him. We learn a lot about what Jesus cared about by noticing what angered him. And nine times out of ten Jesus got angry when people were treated unfairly -when something wrong was done to people, when the needs of people were -overlooked or ignored. And it was the same here. Jesus knew these children wanted and needed him to hold them and bless them. His huge heart went out to them. So when the disciples tried to stop them, Jesus got angry and said, What are you doing? Let them come. Let them come! Dont do you dare stop them! This tells us a great deal about Jesus. It tells us that he loved children and children loved him. It tells us that Jesus was not gloomy, stuffy and boring. He was filled with joy and was not afraid to play and have fun. He loved to laugh and have a good time. He was approachable. Children are drawn to people like that and this text clearly tells us that children were drawn to Jesus. Even in the midst of teaching and preaching and thinking about the cross Jesus had time to play with children, to look in their eyes and smile, to hold them and bless them. Why was Jesus this way? What was it about children that he loved and appreciated? What was it about children that impressed him? Well, he gives us a clue by saying something truly remarkable in the text: for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Mark 10:14 Wow! The Kingdom of God belongs to children? The Kingdom of God is for those who are just like these children around me who are laughing, hugging, and getting blessed by me. In other words, you want to know what being in relationship with God is all about, loving and obeying God is all about take a look at kids. They have it all figured out and they dont even know it! It was as if Jesus said, Dont look at the religious leaders. Dont look at my disciples. Dont look at those in power. Dont look those who are smart and resourceful. Dont look at those who have money. Jesus said, You want to know what connecting with God and living life in relationship and obedience to God is all about, look at these kids. They will show you all you need to know. What are these kids supposed to show us? What did they have figured out that moved Jesus to give them such high praise? What do kids do that make them the benchmark of all were striving for and trying to be as Christians in relationship with God? Well, listen closely because Jesus gives us the answer and the answer is the most direct and succinct thing Jesus ever said: Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it. And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them. Mark 10:15-16 Whoa! Wait a minute! Hold everything! Thats a big statement from Jesus! Unless we receive the kingdom of God like a little child we will never enter it? What does he mean by that? I think all of us want to enter the kingdom of God, right! We all want in there! Who doesnt want in there? But Jesus said that unless we receive the Kingdom like a kid we can never enter it. How can you receive something and enter it at the same time? Listen closely because those of you who want more of the power and strength of God in your life are about to find out how to get it. Those of you who are tired of swimming upstream in life and are feeling stuck are about to find the solution. Listen up. The Kingdom of God is when Gods will and power are perfectly expressed. One day that will be all the time and everywhere. In the meantime, his will and power are expressed through our relationship with him. So when Jesus is talking about entering the Kingdom he is usually talking about entering a powerful and intimate relationship with God. But he said unless we receive that relationship, come to that relationship, live in that relationship like a child, we will never really know the power, strength, and will of God in our lives. So how does a child receive the Kingdom? How does a child receive anything? With complete and utter dependence! Children are completely dependent on others for their welfare and well being. I remember feeding my nephews when they were little.and they would eat and eat and eatI was struck by how dependent they were on me. And as I took them out to play and walked them across the street, they would squeeze my hand so tight, and again I was struck by how dependent they were on me. And when their toy would break they would come to me completely depending on me to fix what was broken. So Jesus said that unless we can enter a relationship with God with an attitude of dependence, we can never really be in relationship with God. We can never know his power, strength or will in our lives. Approaching God with an attitude of dependence is extremely difficult for us. Why? Because we are impressed with independence not dependence. Lord, just give me a road map and let me handle it myself. I can be self-sufficient. Living this way spiritually is deadly. This is why we struggle. We are searching for our own self sustaining power through independence but the power we seek can only be found by depending on God. Eventually living life on our own power, by our own will, with our own confidence will leave us exhausted and depleted. God designed us to live an empowered relationship with him! And the only way to enter that relationship is by depending on God. So here is the message: We want independence; God wants dependence. We are impressed with independence. God is impressed with dependence. Now, does this mean God wants "
May-24-2015-sermon,"Methodist). Im sure for years the Samaritan thought God was angry at him.he was a Samaritan he had leprosy But once he was healed, he knew he could count on a loving God no matter what. He would still have to deal with the fact that he was a Samaritan. He would still have to deal with other illnesses like everyone else. But now he knew he could count on Gods love no matter what he faced in life. And folks thats where a healing attitude of gratitude comes from. Gratitude is grounded in the nature of a loving God; not in the circumstances of our lives (Harper). Its good to count your blessings and to thank God for what you have in life but eventually that will wear thin. It will only go so far. There will be days when you have more burdens than blessings and if you base your thinking on Gods view of you through blessings it will always lead to disappointment. Thats why many folks think God is mad at them or does not love them! Maybe that is where you are today. You think God is angry at you. You think God does not love you. Like the Samaritan leper you have kept God at arms length because you think all the painful stuff of your life means God is angry at you. Nothing could be further from the truth. We as disciples give thanks not for what is happening to us but for the fact that nothing can happen to us apart from the loving presence of God! (Harper). We dont give thanks to God for everything because everything is good. Some things stink! We give thanks to God because he is present in everything and ready and willing to come to our assistance and help us. Because God is good we can give all our burdens to him. God cares. God knows and God gives strength, grace and peace. Paul had learned the kind of faith that made him well. He said: I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength. Philippians 4:11-13 John Wesley had this kind of gratitude. Many dont know that Wesley had a great fear of death, like many do. Earlier in his life, it was his greatest fear. He really struggled with it. But when he came to the hour of death his last words were, The best of all is, God is with us. Wesley died giving thanks that God would always be with him! So your homework is quite simple. I want you to do two things. For the next week, wake up every day and pray this prayer: God, I am so grateful I can count on your loving presence in everything. I know there is nothing I am going to face today that you and I cant handle. And then make note of Glory Sightings in your life this week. Where do you see God at work in your life? Where have you seen, felt or been aware of Gods loving presence in your life? Doing those two things everyday will make you well. Amen. Pasadena Community Church WWWWWhhhhho ooooAAAAArrrrre eeeeYYYYYooooou uuuuTTTTTrrrrryyyyyiiiiinnnnng ggggttttto ooooIIIIImmmmmppppprrrrreeeeessssssssss? ????~ The One Who Came Back Luke 17: 11 -19 Sunday, May 24, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today I continue our series, Who are you trying to impress?

He was terribly sick and an outcast in society but thats not what made him special to Jesus. What made him special to Jesus was his attitude and how his attitude affected his behavior. That is what impressed Jesus. In fact, we are going to see in just a minute that his attitude healed him. What was so special about his attitude and why did it heal him? Well, you are about to find out. But before I go into this mans story I want to tell you what todays message can do for you. Todays message can give you a profound attitude adjustment and change the way you understand God and the way you see your life. Anyone need an attitude adjustment today? We all need one from time to time. Some need a bigger adjustment than others, but we all need one and we all know others who need one. Turn the person next to you and say, You need an attitude adjustment. Ever been around someone who is negative all the time? They just always see the bad in everything. If you say, Wow! Its a gorgeous day. They will reply, Yeah, but we really need more rain. If you say, That was a great golf shot! They will reply, Yeah, but I still have to putt and I can screw that up. If you say, That was a great meal. They, Yeah, Ive had better. They just cant be happy and satisfied with where they are and what is front of them. They are always negative, always critical, always relentless in their refusal to find joy in anything. And its not fun being around these folks, is it? Life for them is a problem to be confronted instead of a great adventure to be lived. Do you know someone like that? Is that someone you? Is that where you are today? Do you find yourself at a place where you see everything in your life as a problem to be confronted? Every day you wake up you feel like you are preparing for another battle. Do you find yourself focusing on the negative in life because that way you feel like you will never be disappointed? Do you often see the bad in others instead of their good qualities because one negative experience with a person has caused you to be jaded? Are you cynical about life most of the time and is it choking the joy and peace out of you? Are you angry at God because you have always thought God was angry at you? Are you generally anxious all the time and cant figure out why? Do you just not like where you are in life? Well, today I am going to show you how to get joy back in your life.

This message can enable you to no longer see life as a series of problems to confront and solve but opportunities to embrace and enjoy. But maybe some of you are thinking, Yeah, this sounds too good to be true. How can one sermon do all that? I mean, Charley, Im all for this change in attitude and finding joy, but arent you aiming a bit high, bud? Well, I have two things to say to that. One, Jesus is really the one who is making this promise, not me. I am simply going to tell a story about Jesus pronouncing healing on a man because of his attitude. And I believe it is a story that applies to every single one of us. Plain and simple. Two, what do you have to lose? The only thing you have to lose is a bad attitude that is killing your soul. And what do you have to gain? All the joy and meaning and vitality that God wants for you. So lets take a closer look at this mans story and the transforming message it teaches us. His story appears in the gospel of Luke, chapter 17: Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. Luke 17:11-12 So Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem with his disciples and as he gets near Samaria he enters a leper colony. Now lepers were considered unclean to Jews because of their disease. Leprosy was an awful disease. It caused the skin to develop ugly painful sores everywhere. Back then Jews believed if you got leprosy it was because of some terrible sin you committed. And if you touched a leper you were considered unclean. So lepers were forced to live together in colonies away from their own communities. They were separated from family and friends and couldnt even worship God with everyone else. But Jesus completely disregarded the dumb taboo of leprosy. They were Gods children like anybody else and he never let silly cultural norms and religious laws get in the way of loving people. So he just walked right into a leper colony. Look what happened next: They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice, Jesus, Master, have pity on us! Luke 17:13 Whenever lepers got anywhere near other people who didnt have the disease, they were supposed to yell out, Unclean, Unclean! And they were especially required to do it if they were anywhere near a rabbi. So here came Jesus, and he walked right into a colony filled with lepers. And he saw ten lepers with awful, painful, sores all over the bodies. They stood at a distance, but instead of yelling out, Unclean! Unclean! they yelled out, Jesus, please have mercy on us! They were in so much pain and misery. They had heard of Jesus and his healing power and they just wanted relief from their suffering. Maybe ten of them saw Jesus coming from a long way. Maybe they heard the rumor he was going to show up and they got together and said, We know it is a long shot. We know he might not even look at us, but maybe if we scream out loud enough he will help us. So they mustered enough courage to do it and when they saw Jesus, they saw love in his eyes and begged him to help them. Look at what happens next: When he saw them, he said, Go, show yourselves to the priests. And as they went, they were cleansed. Luke 17:14 Wow! Jesus gave one look at these lepers and he was so moved with compassion that he didnt even want to take the time to go through the routine of healing them. He just snapped his fingers and said, Go back to the temple and show the priests you are no longer unclean. And they were probably thinking. What? So they did what Jesus said and as they were headed to the temple one said, Hey, wait a second! I dont have any sores on my arm! Wait, I dont think there are any on my face!....Me too. Me too! Its gone! Wow! Were clean! Were healed!.Amazing. But what happened next was just as amazing to Jesus: One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself at Jesus feet and thanked him -Luke 17:15-16 One of the lepers couldnt contain himself. He was so happy, so grateful, so overwhelmed with joy and thanksgiving that he said, You know what, Ill catch up with you guys a little later. Ive got to go thank Jesus for what he has done for me. He has changed my life! I must tell him how grateful I am! And he threw himself at Jesus. The other nine just kept going but this one man went back to Jesus to thank him. But thats not the only reason why he was different. Take a look: and he was a Samaritan. Luke 17:16 Whoa! The Jews hated the Samaritans. They were half Jew half something else. They practiced their faith the wrong way. They were half breeds and pagans. So not only was this man a leper; he was also an outcast! He was an outcast times two! And yet he was the one who came back to thank Jesus. The other nine never looked back. It never occurred to them to say Thank You. But this outcast was so grateful for what Jesus had done for him that he didnt care what other people thought about him. He was going to thank Jesus! And he did. And as he was kneeling before Jesus giving all kinds of thanks and praise Jesus made a penetrating observation: Jesus asked, Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner? Luke 17:17-18 Now, this is too good. This is funny. You have to understand the tone in which Jesus said this. There was probably a crowd of people watching all of this, many of whom were devout Jews who despised Samaritans. These questions were rhetorical. He was trying to make a point. Remember Jesus was always for the underdog. He loved those who were marginalized. And in that spirit he said this with tongue in cheek. It was as if he is saying to the crowd, You think you have it all figured out, that you are only ones who get it, that you are perfect and the Samaritans are worthless and have it all wrong. And yet looky here! It was the Samaritan who got it right! It was the Samaritan who responded with a spiritually mature vitality. What do you know? You think he was doubly cursed. I tell you he is doubly blessed! Look at what Jesus said: Then he said to him, Rise and go; your faith has made you well. Luke 17:19 Wait a second? Wasnt he already healed? Why did Jesus heal him twice? Why did Jesus say that? He was already cleansed and healed on his way to church. Why was he doubly blessed? Well, the first healing was physical but the second healing was spiritual. Well means Whole. Jesus was saying that his grateful attitude had made him whole on the inside. It had healed his brokenness. It had healed him of any of the bitterness, cynicism, anger that had plagued him for so long as a leper and a Samaritan. The other nine, well their leprosy on the outside was gone but its possible that they still had leprosy on the inside. I know people who are physically healthy but spiritually dead. I know people who go to the doctor and get healed physically but their souls are sick. Not the Samaritan. He was physically and spiritually whole because of his attitude of gratitude. So what does this powerful story have to teach us about a healing attitude, about an attitude that turns our sadness into joy, our mourning into dancing, our anxiety into peace? Well, its not what you might think. This is not one of those sermons where I tell you, Be grateful for what you have. Count your blessings and you will appreciate what you do have and that will change your attitude. Thats not bad. In fact, that is very good. But thats not what this text teaches us and thats not the attitude that healed the Samaritan leper. And truthfully, counting your blessings only goes so far. Here is the message: Gratitude comes from relying on Gods love; not on the circumstances of our lives. Gratitude comes from relying on the love of God in everything. You see, I dont think that leper came back to Jesus to thank him because he was so holy and good and won the Norman Vincent Peale award for being the most positive Samaritan in Samaria. I believe the Samaritan was the one who came back to thank Jesus because he realized through his healing that to God he wasnt an outsider. He wasnt despised. He wasnt less than. He wasnt worthless. He wasnt all those things people said about him. When he looked into the eyes of Jesus he realized that God loved him and he could count on that love no matter what. When he was healed he realized that he was a child of God just like the others. His healing went much deeper than cleansing him of leprosy. It cleansed him of all the terrible things the culture told him he was and put a new spirit in him that could count on the love of God. Thats what made him so grateful. Charles Allen was Senior Pastor of the First United Methodist Church of Houston, Texas for many years. And for many years he was the best known Methodist pastor in the world. Some years ago he was interviewed by a group of ministers at an annual conference.

Without hesitation, he replied, The number one problem I have had to deal with is the mistaken notion so many people have that God is mad at them.

May-31-2015-sermon,"know the quickest way to get close to Jesus? Go get a sandwich for a homeless person and look him in the eyes. Hold the hand of someone suffering in the hospital. Visit someone in prison. Help build a habitat house. If you do that, I promise you will feel close to Christ. It is the quickest and easiest way to Jesus heart. Yesterday I drove over to Largo to feed a group of people in our church who volunteered to help build a Habitat house for a family in need. I brought them lunch from Panera. As I watched them come get their lunch with sweat all over them and their bodies stiff and worn out, I could tell by looking in their eyes that most, if not all, of them were as close to Jesus as they have ever been in their lives. The church spends too much time majoring in the minors. If the church spent as much time caring and loving those in need as it does debating doctrine and passing judgment the world would be a different place. If you read the rest of the parable you will find that the goats are discarded. Now dont panic. This does not denote finality, but it is definitely a warning and a time for pruning. Its as if we are being told through the parable to keep our eye on the ball and what is most important to Jesus. This week I was coming out of Walgreens and a homeless man asked me for a couple of dollars for food. I said, Tell you what; there is a Checkers across the street. How about I go over there and get you whatever you want? He replied, Really? I said, Really! Ill get you 20 hamburgers if you want them. Name it. He told me he wanted four checker burgers, large fries and a coke with no ice. I said, You go it. I drove across the street, ordered his food, and came back to hand it to him. When I gave him the bag of food there was a big smile on his face and he said, You are a true friend. Well, I drove away and then I remembered that I forgot to get something at Walgreens. So I turned around and drove back. It hadnt been more than 5 or 10 minutes. When I parked I saw the homeless man and the bag of food was empty. He had eaten the entire meal that quickly. He devoured it. He gave me a fist pump and said, You are a true friend. I must say that as I he said it I thought about this sermon and it was as if Christ was saying to me through this man, You are a true friend. It reminded me of what Christ said to Peter, Do you love me? Then feed my sheep. So this week I dont think you will have to work very hard finding ways to apply todays message. You dont have to find the cure to cancer or the solution to world peace. You dont have to solve world hunger. All you have to do is reach out to one person in need. Just find one person this week who is in need and reach out and help them. Maybe it will be a homeless person you give a hamburger to. Maybe it will be a child who needs mentoring or a friend in the hospital who needs a visit. Maybe it will be someone who is lonely who needs someone to listen to them. Whatever it is, just pick one person to help. It just may change your life. We all know the name of Mother Theresa. Her name is synonymous with Christian love and service. Talk about a person who got what it means to follow Jesus! When she heard that there will be people dying in the streets of Calcutta because the religious community said they were untouchable, she said, Not on my watch! So, she built a hospital in Calcutta and loved and cared for the poor and outcast. She went out into the streets to find the beaten, broken and bruised. She brought them to the hospital where they could be cared for, rocked, prayed for and loved. Some got better and some died in her arms. When she won the Nobel Peace Prize, she took the money and gave it all to the poor. Why did she do it? She revealed why she did it when she was asked to speak to a group of nuns many years ago. This small woman with a big spirit arose to the podium, lifted her hands, and counting with each of her fingers spoke these ten words: What you do for them, you also do for him. Look around you this week and you will find the hungry, the wounded, the weak, the lonely, the thirsty, and if you are willing to reach out to care for them you just may see the face of Christ and hear him say, You are a true friend. Amen. Pasadena Community Church WWWWWhhhhho ooooAAAAArrrrre eeeeYYYYYooooou uuuuTTTTTrrrrryyyyyiiiiinnnnng ggggttttto ooooIIIIImmmmmppppprrrrreeeeessssssssss? ????~ Touching Jesus Matthew 25: 31 -40 Sunday, May 31, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today we conclude our series Who are you trying to impress? Its been an interesting journey as we have discovered the people in the gospels who really impressed Jesus. We saw a poor widow impress Jesus by sacrificing everything she had for God. We were amazed at the faith of a pagan solider who expected Jesus to heal his servant. We were moved by Marys unwavering commitment to spend quality time with Jesus. We were also moved by how Jesus was so taken by a woman who did a small act with great love. We were convicted at Jesus comments about how children embody the dependency we must have on God. And we learned a great deal of wisdom from a marginalized leper who learned to be grateful that he could count on Gods love no matter what he faced in life. I hope this series has inspired us to dedicate our lives impressing Jesus. Not that we earn his grace by impressing him, but when we experience the grace of Christ it is our hearts desire to please him. And this series has given us examples of how to do that. So I hope you will reflect on each of these messages and seek ways to live them out. For, after all, what is more fulfilling in life than impressing Jesus? Today we end this series with what I believe impresses Jesus the most. Today we are going to learn what gets to the heart of Jesus more than anything else. If you really want to touch the heart of Jesus, you will want to listen carefully today. In fact, what we are going to learn today is that what touches the heart of Jesus is so important it is the basis of how each of us will be judged when the kingdom of God comes in all its glory. Thats right. What we are going to learn today is so important to Jesus that our faith will be judged based on whether or not our lives reflected this particular characteristic. The Bible is clear that there will be a judgment. Everyone will be judged by God. Christians will be judged. Even saints of the church will be judged. All of us will be judged. Now this is different from salvation. We will address that a little later but the Bible is clear that even those who have received Christ as Savior will be judged. The Bible is also clear that we will not be judged on what we believe, although what we believe is very important. We will not be judged on how strong our faith is, although having a strong faith is critical. We will not be judged on what denomination we were a part of, although that can be important. We will not be judged on whether we got sprinkled, dunked or poured on at our baptism. What we are going to discover today from the lips of Jesus is that we will not be judged by our faith but by a particular fruit of our faith. Again, this does not mean faith is not important, but for Jesus if our faith is genuine this particular fruit will be evident and obvious. Therefore, Jesus is clear that we will be judged by this particular fruit. I believe some of you just might be surprised by the fruit we will be judged by. Because so many of us have preconceived notions or misguided understandings about what is important to Jesus. In fact, those of you who dont consider yourselves Christian may be surprised as well. It may change your understanding of God. The fruit that will be judged is not a creed. It is not your prayer life. It is not your opinion on same sex marriage or any other emotionally charged issue. It is not your view of the Bible or the way you interpret the Bible. It is not the way you worship or the television shows you watched or how often you attended church or how often you cussed or thought impure thoughts. Although all of those things are important issues to Jesus and they certainly play a critical role in our faith. But according to Jesus and the witness of all scripture there is but one fruit of faith that will be the basis of judgment. ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org And this may be a game changer for you. What you discover today may change the way you approach your faith and live out your faith. What you learn today may reorient the way you see your faith and relationship with Christ. One thing I promise  todays message will draw you closer to the heart of Christ. We talk a lot about getting close to Christ and developing our relationship with Christ. Well today, you are going to find out how to get close to his heart. In fact, this message will draw us so close to Christ that it may change the way we do church. It may change the way we approach ministry and run the business of the church. It may change the way we spend and budget our money. It may change the way you do business and the way you personally spend money. It may change the way we spend our time personally and professionally. So if you are someone who is concerned with how Jesus thinks you are doing in the way you follow him, listen up. If you are someone who is concerned with getting this faith thing right and making God proud, listen up. You are about to find out what touches the heart of Jesus and the fruit of faith that Jesus believes is critical. Lets take a look at something Jesus said in the 25th chapter of the gospel of Matthew. This whole chapter is made up of three parables Jesus told about judgment. These parables are meant to give us a heads up about being prepared for judgment and knowing the basis of judgment. We are going to look at the final parable in this chapter which reveals the fruit of the faith that Jesus believes reveals genuine faith. Jesus parable begins this way: When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. Matthew 25:31-33 Wow! This parable gives a bit of a sneak preview of what will happen when the kingdom of God fully comes on the earth! Now, again, it is a parable, so it has its limits. But one thing is clear. When the kingdom comes Jesus will be in power and in glory and all nations will be under him. The Bible says that Every knee shall bow and tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord! According to the parable, when all the nations of the world are before Jesus, a judgment will occur. This judgment will divide folks into two camps: the sheep and the goats. Now in Palestine in Jesus day a shepherd could easily separate sheep and goats by their color and bodily characteristics. The sheep will be put on the right side, the side of honor and blessing. And the goats will be put on the left side, the side of dishonor. Look what happens next: Then the King will say to those on his right, Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. Matthew 25:34 So in the parable Jesus said the sheep, those on the right side, those on the blessed side will be invited to enter the beautiful and glorious kingdom of heaven. They will be invited to take their inheritance and realize all the promises of eternal life. Why do the sheep on the right get an invitation into the kingdom of heaven? What did they do that the goats did not do? Was it because they were holy? Methodists? Was it because they worshipped in a contemporary service or had the correct doctrine? Was it because they had read tons of books on theology and acquired vast knowledge? No. Then what was it? You ready for this? For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me. Matthew 25:35-36 Jesus said the sheep, the righteous, those with genuine faith are those who fed the hungry, gave water to the thirsty, were hospitable to strangers, clothed the naked, took care of the sick and visited prisoners. Let me say that again. In the parable Jesus said those who inherited the kingdom were those who took care of the stranger, the sick, thirsty hungry, naked, and the prisoner. So, according to this parable, when the kingdom of God comes each of us will be singled out and Christ will not ask us about our creed, denomination, or doctrine. He will not ask us how many Bible studies or worship services we attended. No. He will ask us, What did you do about the homeless in your community? Did you take care of your neighbors and enemies who were sick? Did you ever visit the local jail? Did you ever invite someone into your home who wasnt welcome anywhere else? So we can conclude that Christ judges our faith based on how we respond to human need. Christ judges us to see if our faith has led to true self denial and sympathy for the beaten, broken and bruised. Christ judges us to see if our faith in him moves us to love as he loves. Now I remember when I was younger and read this parable it messed up my good Protestant theology. I always believed and I still believe that we are saved by the grace of God through faith. Its not based on works! It doesnt matter how good you are or how much good you have done, but it is whether or not you have repented and received Christ as Lord and Savior. Its about whether or not Christ lives in your heart. Its about faith and not works. And then I read this parable and thought, That seems to go against everything I have been taught! Jesus, my savior, seems to be saying that it is based on how good I have been! Well, dont let this parable mess up your theology. I still believe and will always believe that we are saved by grace through faith. In fact, we cant do anything we are called by God to do without the grace of God. Whats very important to keep in mind is that this is not a salvation parable but a judgment parable. All people, including those who have been saved, will be judged on the fruit of their faith. The Bible is clear that we are saved by grace but the Bible is also clear we will be judged on how well we responded to that grace by helping those who suffer and those in need. So you want to know how Christ will be able to tell if our faith in him is genuine, if he really lives in our hearts, if his love is alive in us? He will be able to tell by one distinguishing characteristic: how we have responded to human need. Period. So it does matter what we believe because if our faith in Christ as Savior is real, we will love and care for those in need. Period. So you really want to touch the heart of Jesus? You really want to warm his heart? You really want to pull on his heart strings? You really want to impress the heck out of him? Care for those in need. Now I know what some of you may be thinking. Really? This is what impresses Jesus the most? This is what touches him the most? Charity? Being kind to those who are less fortunate than us? I mean, dont get me wrong. I think it is important too, but why does the parable make it the only criteria? I mean, we know we are supposed to be nice to people, and kind and generous, but arent a lot of people like that? Why is responding to those in need this important to Jesus? Well Jesus tells us why in the parable because the sheep in the parable were just as surprised and bewildered as some of you may be. They didnt understand how Jesus was connected to how they responded to those in need. Take a look: Then the righteous will answer him, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you? Matthew 25:37-39 And then Jesus responded with some of the most profound, convicting and moving words he ever spoke: The King will reply, Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me. Matthew 25:40 Why does Christ judge our faith based on how we respond to human need? Because Christ is so intimately connected to every human being that he feels every wound, every tear, and every pain we feel. He loves the world so much that he cant stand the suffering. And so when we touch, heal, love, serve, feed, clothe, visit, and listen, Christ feels it just as if we were doing it to him. Its like when someone does something nice for a child. How does the parent feel? The parent feels it just as much as the child. My mom used to say, Having a child is like having your heart come out of your body and walk around in the world. Imagine how much more Christ feels our wounds and pain! I remember when I was in seminary at Emory I had the privilege of serving communion in chapel when two dignitaries who were in worship, former President Jimmy Carter and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the great champion of peace in South Africa. In fact, I helped Archbishop Tutu serve communion. As I stood next to him, holding the elements, I remember his hands. They were not the soft hands of a church dignitary; rather they were the hands of a servant of Christ. They were rough, callused and scarred, hands not afraid to serve Christ who also possessed wounded hands. Later Archbishop Tutu preached a sermon. And he said something in his message I have never forgotten. He talked about the saving love of Christ and how it can transform all of us  a love that truly died for our sins. But, he said, if you really want to get close to Jesus, you will not stay at the foot of the cross, but you will climb up on the cross to see what Jesus sees and to feel what Jesus feels. And if you have the courage to do that you will understand why caring for those in need is so important to Jesus because right now someone here today is suffering from loneliness. Right now someone thinks they are nobody to nobody. Right now someone is suffering from abuse and misuse. Right now someone is suffering from depression. Right now someone is suffering with a debilitating illness. Right now someone is suffering from an unforgiven past. I find that people are always trying to get closer to Jesus. They brag about all the Bible studies they do and the conferences they will be going to and all they are going to do to improve their prayer life. And all of that is good and useful but you want to "
Nov-1-2015-sermon,"PASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org Pasadena Community Church What is Heaven Like? John 14: 1 -Sunday, November 1 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today I want to talk to you about heaven and why it matters. One of the central beliefs of Christianity is that disciples of Jesus Christ will spend eternity with God in heaven. Jesus said, I am the resurrection and I am the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, yet shall they live. This means if we put our trust in Christ and follow him we are promised everlasting life with him in heaven. But what is heaven really? Is it a place where angels play harps on clouds and St. Peter stands at the gate letting people in? The whole idea of heaven is caricatured in our culture, but what will it really be like? I bet you have the same questions I have. Will I know my loved ones in heaven? And will they know me? I hope so. I miss my father and I hope he knows me in heaven. And I am sure you have loved ones you miss and hope to see again. And what will we do in heaven? Just sit in church and listen to an organ being played all day? Will there be golf in heaven? And what about our pets? Thats important. Do our pets go to heaven? And what about our bodies? Will we be like ghosts floating around in the clouds or will we have physical bodies? And is heaven a physical place or does it exist in a spiritual dimension? Perhaps the most important question for us today is why is heaven so important right now? What difference does heaven make in our lives today? Christians are often accused of being so heavenly minded that they are no earthly good. Does believing in heaven make a difference to how we live our day to day lives? Should it make any difference? I want to jump right in and answer these important questions because believe it or not the Bible answers many of the questions we have about heaven. So often we make assumptions about heaven without really looking at what the Bible has to say. So, I want us to take a look at a passage of scripture that is near to the heart of many of us. It is the beginning of the 14th chapter of John. These are Jesus words to his disciples in the upper room before he is taken away to be crucified. He was about to face his own death. He knew it. The disciples are afraid. They just found out that their fellow disciple Judas betrayed Jesus. They are not sure about their own fate. So, sensing their fear and unrest, Jesus speaks these words to his disciples. These are some of the most beautiful and comforting words in the Bible. Verse one: Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in me. The context of this passage has to do with death  Jesus death and our own death. Jesus is saying that when it comes to death we have nothing to fear! If we believe in him, if we have put our lives in his hands, we have nothing to fear from death. We can live life boldly and courageously! And that is so ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~Servedifferent than the world isnt it? Our culture is terrified of death. Many people dont want to think or talk about death. But those who follow Christ are not afraid to die. It doesnt mean we live life foolishly but it does mean we are confident in the face of death. Why should we not be afraid of death? Christ gives us the answer in verse two: In my Fathers house are many dwelling places. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? Oh, wow! Jesus says his Father has a house. God has a house. Can you imagine how big that house is? Imagine the square footage of that one? What is Gods house? Heaven! But when Jesus says Gods house has many dwelling places he means this house is not just for God. Gods house has an infinite number of guest rooms! Whats more is that Jesus says he will prepare a special place for each one of us in heaven. So what will this place be like? If Jesus is preparing a place in heaven for his followers it must be pretty sweet, huh? Well, in other places in scripture we are given a breathtaking glimpse of what our heavenly place will be like. Isaiah has two wonderful things to say about the Kingdom of Heaven. He tells us: They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more (2:4). This means in heaven hate will not exist, war will not exist, violence will not exist and bloodshed will not exist. Gods creation will be at peace! This implies that heaven includes a renewed earth. The world will be healed. Isaiah also says this about heaven: The wolf will lie down with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child shall lead them. (11:6-9). Notice the contrasts in this verse  wolves lying down with lambs, leopards lying down with goats and children running the show? We know this does not happen in our world. What does this mean? The virtues of heaven will be different than the virtues of world. The virtues in heaven will not be competition, survival of the fittest, exclusion or intimidation, but love, trust, peace, harmony, joy and play! Oh, since animals are mentioned in this verse, we have it on good authority that our pets will go to heaven too! The book of Revelation contains one of the most touching descriptions about heaven: See, the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself with be with them. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more, for the first things have passed away (21:3-4). This tells us that in heaven we will dwell with God. We will experience intimacy with God and be in His presence forever. God will wipe away our tears and there will be no more suffering. This means that in heaven there will be no cancer, disease, abuse, hunger, poverty, or death. Now, if all this is true, what kind of shape will we be in heaven? Will we have physical bodies or spiritual bodies? Well, Jesus addresses this in verse 3 of John 14: And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, so that where I am, there you may be also. Jesus is talking about his resurrection. When Jesus was resurrected he wasnt some ghost. He had a physical body. He asked Thomas to touch him. He asked his disciples for some fish. Later, Jesus said, Because I live you will live. This means that just as Jesus experienced a physical resurrection so will we. When Jesus comes back to usher us into heaven we will receive new and improved bodies just like him! This sounds exciting, but will other people be able to recognize us? If we have new bodies will loved ones know who we are? Paul addresses this very issue in 2nd Corinthians 4:16-18: So we do not lose heart. Even though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed day by day. In other words, our physical bodies break down  we get sick and we die. But with the help of God our souls are growing stronger. Paul continues, For this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure. The affliction Paul is speaking of is the pain and tragedy of life. But God uses our adversity to stretch and strengthen our inner nature. The adversity is not His will but God uses our experiences to grow us spiritually. And our spiritual growth is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory. This weight of glory is what God thinks of us. The weight of glory is that moment when God throws his arms around us and says, I am so proud of you! I love you. Watch what Paul says next: Because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen; for what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal. You know what this verse implies? People will know who we are in heaven because in heaven who we are on the inside today will be seen on the outside. Our beauty in heaven is something totally different than on earth. We will all be beautiful in heaven because who we are on the inside will be visible on the outside. Our character, our strength, our growth, our faithfulness, our love, our sensitivity will be seen on the outside, and it will be gorgeous. This is what Paul meant in 1st Corinthians 13, I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. So, why does belief in heaven matter? Why does it matter that we believe we are going to heaven? Because Christian character is eternal. Who we are today and how we behave as a result of who we are has eternal significance. The decisions we make today -how we grow today -how we respond to adversity and suffering -the consistency of our prayer life will make up who we are in heaven. You see, heaven is the pay off for all of the spiritual work we have done on earth. Dont let this mess up your theology. We are saved by Gods grace in Christ and through trust in that grace we are given eternal life. But the Bible is clear that when we get to heaven we will receive recompense (2nd Corinthians 5:10) for who we are and what we have done. We will receive what we have spiritually built up for ourselves on earth. So, how we behave as Christians on earth not only matters now but it also matters in heaven. Everything on earth is fleeting. Paul says what can be seen is temporary. What cannot be seen is eternal. Our bodies, our money, our vanity, our possessions  they dont last. What lasts is God and our character before God. What lasts is what we have done for God on earth and our presence before God in glory. And we groan for it. Paul says in our passage today that while we live in this temporary tent we groan for our new body, our new life, our glorious existence with God in heaven. We know that all the pain and suffering is not worth comparing with what we will experience with God in heaven. So we never lose heart. Christian character is eternal. You know the most important word in the Christian faith? Hope. Only the Christian faith can give us hope. Only the Christian faith gives us hope that what we do now has eternal significance. Only the Christian faith gives us the hope to never fear death. Only the Christian faith gives us hope that death is our victory. In heaven all of Gods promises we have lived for, worked for, groaned for will become reality. Jesus said, I go to prepare a place for you. Amen "

Last week I emphasized that we need to live the abundant life God calls us to live now because life is too short. Experience Gods love. Live the dreams God has put on your heart. Live life to the fullest because that is what God wants for you. Life is just too short to live any other way. Our Psalm for the series is Psalm 39:4-7. Lets read it together: LORD, remind me how brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered how fleeting my life is. You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand. My entire lifetime is just a moment to you; at best, each of us is but a breath. We are merely moving shadows, and all our busy rushing ends in nothing. We heap up wealth, not knowing who will spend it. And so, Lord, where do I put my hope? My only hope is in you. (NLT) Well that Psalm is not only appropriate for our series, it is appropriate for us as we think about the horrific attacks in Paris. Life can be so fleeting and our only hope is in the Lord! Todays topic is stress. Life is too short to be stressed. If there ever was an appropriate topic for us today, it is this one. What occurred in Paris has us stressed out to say the least! We are stressed, worried, afraid, terrified and overwhelmed. So there is great tension in this topic because what happened in Paris reminds us of how short life can be! So how do we reconcile that one, right? What if we get stressed out because of the reality that life is too short? I am sure that is a question on some of your minds. How can we not be stressed out with this kind of evil going on in the world? But maybe on top of all this you also have stress closer to home. You have financial troubles, family problems, issues at work or school. Maybe as you think about Thanksgiving coming up you are thinking about the stress of being with all of the family. Crazy Uncle George will show up again. Or the in laws are coming and they are going to say or do those things that drive you nuts! Just fill in the blank. I get it. You show me a family that doesnt have at least some dysfunction and I will show you some pretty good liars! Everywhere we turn in life there is stress  work, family, school, kids, finances. Then we get on Face Book or turn on the news and we are terrified at what we see. Life is filled with stress and worry. So how are we not supposed to get stressed out? How are you going to preach this sermon, preacher? Believe me, I get it. Brandy and I went on a date Friday night. Life has been so busy for both of us and we were way overdue. Things have been crazy at the church and things have been crazy for her at work. We needed a relaxing evening together. So we went out and had a nice dinner and then we played Putt-Putt. We hadnt done that in years! The weather was nice and cool. I even got a hole in one! We were having a ball. But as soon as we finished we looked at our phones and got the news about Paris. We didnt want it too, but it took the wind from our sails. How could it not? Ill tell you this whole week has been stressful for me! It started with that Starbucks nonsense and then ended with the tragedy in Paris. What do both of these stories have in common? People distorting religion yet again! Thats what stresses me out! Yeah, the easy thing to do is to be angry at a religion. But it is not religion that should be our focus; it is the people who distort religion that should be our focus. When the story about the Starbucks cups came out this week I thought it was a satire, a joke. And then I found out it was real. Some off his rocker Christian decided to go on a ridiculous crusade about how the new plain red holiday Starbucks cups are a protest against Christmas and that Christians are being persecuted? Why? Because Starbucks decided not to put snowmen or snowflakes on their cups this year. Seriously? First of all, did anyone bother to tell this guy that snowflakes and snowmen are not Christian symbols? Last time I read the gospels I didnt see Frosty the Snowman around Jesus in the manger! Furthermore, Starbucks sells Christmas items all over their store  Christmas coffee blends and Christmas mugs. Last but not least, the last time I checked red and green are Christmas colors! And then we wonder why some people want nothing to do with Christianity or the church? Weve got a world filled with hurting and broken people who need the love of Christ and you want to get your underwear in a wad over coffee cups from a secular business? Heres one for you: If one family in one out of every three churches adopted a child from foster care, there would be no more orphans in the United States. But please, tell me more about how offensive this red coffee cup is (quote from Face Book). Lord, save us from some of your followers! This whole war on Christmas thing has got me stressed out too. Yeah, I know. I need this sermon. People need to know our history. People fled to America for religious freedom. The hallmark of America is that people can practice their religion in peace without the threat of persecution. Freedom of religion means the freedom to practice our religion and the freedom for others to practice their religion. When someone practices their religion next to yours it is not war or persecution. It is called America! It is called liberty! It is called what our veteran died and sacrificed for! Ignorance is going to destroy this country if people dont wake up. I am stressed out over this stuff, so I need this sermon more than anyone today. You know what a sermon is, dont you? A preacher speaking loudly to himself. And I am doing that today! Of course, the stress is compounded by the unspeakable events in Paris. And it is not just how awful and horrific the events were that stresses me out. It is how it will fuel the fire of hate in some Christians and cause them to pigeon hole a religion because of the evil acts of a small minority. Lets remember our religious history. Blood is on the hands of all religions, not because of the religion, but because of the sinful hearts of those who pervert religion. Remember what Martin Luther King, Jr. said, Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. So I am stressed out! And I need to know how God and the scriptures can help me not be so stressed out. How about you? You want to join me today in finding some help? I know life is too short to be stressed out, so Lord help us find out how! As I was praying and reflecting on this sermon, a passage came to me and I think it might be exactly what we need today. The text comes from Matthew chapter 7. It is a portion of the greatest sermon ever preached, The Sermon on the Mount: Everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock. The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on rock. Matthew 7:24-25 So Jesus gives us a metaphor that all of us here in Florida can relate to, especially those who have flood insurance and have lived through a hurricane! Jesus said that someone who not only hears his teachings but acts on them, does them, puts them into practice, will be like someone who was wise enough to build his house on a firm foundation, so that when the storms and wind and rain came the house remained strong and standing. But then Jesus gives us another example. Take a look: And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it felland great was its fall! Matthew 7:24-27 Alright, so Jesus says unlike the first man who was wise enough to build his house on rock, this other guy, this foolish guy, built his house on sand so when the rain, wind, storms came it fell down like a house of cards. And why? Because unlike the wise man, the foolish man heard Jesus teaching but did not act on it. In other words, he did not follow Jesus. So we can conclude from what Jesus said that if we want to remain strong through the stresses and storms of life heres what we have to do: We have to build our lives around Jesus and what he has taught us. We must follow Jesus. If we want to remain standing when the winds of change blow we have to base our lives on more than platitudes and hallmark cards and wishful thinking. We must build our lives on Jesus and his teachings. For if we follow Jesus our lives will be built on a foundation that never collapses, fails, falls, or wavers. If we build our lives on the sand of selfishness, greed, vanity, power or pleasure our lives will eventually collapse. Sooner or later the storms and stresses of life are going to come and if we have built our lives on a shallow foundation we will collapse. The stress will get the better of us. We will fall. Our moral structure will collapse. Our internal compass will go haywire. We will be a ship without a rudder. But if we base our lives on following Jesus, we will always remain standing strong no matter what life throws at us. So my question for all of us today is: What are we building our lives on? Take inventory of your life today. What is your life built on? Is it built on ambition or greed or on the love and generosity of Christ? Is it built on seeking pleasure or is it built on serving others? Is it built on selfishness or is it built on the sacrificial love of Christ? These are important questions because here is what I want you to remember today: If we follow Jesus the storm may be around us but the storm does not have to be in us. Jesus is stronger than the storm and stronger than the stress and stronger than evil. Jesus is stronger than sin and stronger than death. If we fill our soul with Jesus nothing can penetrate it because Jesus is the one who calms the storm, heals the broken, releases the captives, gives sight of the blind, sets people free from bondage, redeems the unredeemable and loves the unlovable. Jesus is stronger than any stress or worry you bring with you to worship today. Jesus came to this earth looked death and evil in the face and laughed and said, I have risen and you cant stop me! Jesus is the only solid rock you can build your life on. Call on him and he will deliver you, he will give you peace in the midst of the storm, and he will heal the broken places in your life. So if you are stressed out today just put your trust in Jesus, put your life in his hands. Fix what you can control and give Jesus what you cant control. On a practical level how do we build our lives on Jesus so that we remain strong in the midst of stresses and strains of life? We know trusting our lives to him is a big part of it. But there is more to it. Jesus is clear in his teaching today that we must act on what he has taught us, not just hear it. And in order for us remain strong on the midst of this present darkness we are facing there is a particular teaching of Jesus we must act on to remain steady and strong: Love. We must fight hate with love! I believe Jesus wants us to show the world right now that love wins! On a personal level you know what I have found to be the best cure for stress? To get out of myself and love somebody. Just find someone to love and care for. Channel the energy of your stress into loving someone who desperately needs love. Loving someone in Jesus name will absorb all the stress inside of you. The Bible says that perfect love casts out fear. So start loving those around you, especially the unlovable. Be the light that overcomes the darkness. Mother Theresa said, Let no one ever come to you without leaving better or happier. Be the living expression of Gods kindness. Kindness in your face. Kindness in your eyes. Kindness in your smile. I believe an appropriate prayer for us to repeat and live out now is The Prayer of Saint Francis. Lets say this together: The Prayer of Saint Francis Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love; Where there is injury, pardon; Where there is doubt, faith; Where there is despair, hope; Where there is darkness, light; "

Abingdon is putting together a business proposal and contract as I speak and they are going to publish the book! All because I let down my nets! Folks, let down your nets! Cast your nets in the direction of Gods joy for you! You will be amazed at what God will do for you! We only have one life! Life is too short to waste time being unhappy. Life is too short not to let down our nets and see what God has planned for our lives. Life is too short not to live with the joy of God in our hearts! This is why I bought a Jeep Wrangler. Why would I buy a Jeep Wrangler? Because theyre fun! Life is too short not to drive what you want! For those who think it is weird that I drive a Wrangler I say, Get over it! To those who think that as a preacher I should drive a Buick or Oldsmobile, I aint that guy! I love driving around in my Jeep with Def Leppard blaring in my speakers! The truth is I am just trying to pattern my life after Elaine Sutter. Elaine is a beloved member of our church who sings in a choir. If there is one person in this church who did not need to hear this sermon today it is Elaine. She should have slept in! A couple of weeks ago Elaine approached me and said, Charley, I lived out your sermon the other day. I was putting gas in my car when this guy and his girlfriend drove up in this shiny new motorcycle! When they both got off the bike, I said, Thats a beautiful motorcycle! The guy said, Well, you want a ride? And I thought a moment and replied, Well, sure! And Elaine got on the back of the motorcycle and let a complete stranger race her around St. Pete! The choir now calls Elaine Motorcycle Mama! Life is too short to be unhappy and Elaine knows it and lives it! What is holding you back from an amazing life? Your thoughts? What you hear? What you think you cant do! Dont let it hold you back anymore! Remember, you are in control of one thing  your God-given life. Choose to be happy. Life is too short to waste time. Life is too short to be stressed out. Life is too short to be unhappy.

In the first message I talked about how life is too short to waste time. Live the dreams God has put on your heart. Experience his love. Be the person God made you to be. Life is too short not to do what you love and love what you do. Last week the topic was stress and I got really fired up and stressed myself out! I needed the message more than you did! The message was life is too short to be stressed out, so we must build our lives on the only foundation that will keep us strong and steady in the midst of the storms of life  Jesus Christ. The storm may rage around us but Jesus keeps the storms from raging within us. Todays message is Life is Too Short to be Unhappy. I want to start my message with a good joke because I want you to be happy. I heard about 3 men who died on the same day and went to heaven. One was a Baptist, one was a Catholic, and the other was a United Methodist. Saint Peter met them at the gates and said, Im sorry guys, your rooms are not available yet. Peter didnt know what to do, and he decided to call Satan and see if he would keep them for a little while. Satan reluctantly agreed. A few hours later, Satan called back and said, Peter, youve got to come get these guys. The Baptist man is saving everybody, the Catholic man is forgiving everybody, and the United Methodist has already raised enough money for air conditioning! And dont you know thats true! When our A/C for the sanctuary finally gave up the ghost, the Holy Ghost, a couple of years ago, it took about a week to raise money to buy a new one! We at Pasadena believe that life is too short and Florida is too hot to have worship without air conditioning! Come to think of it, I may tear out all the seats in the sanctuary this week so that when you come back next week you wont have anywhere to sit. I am sure we will raise enough money for new seating in a week! Im going to write that down! Well, life is too short to be unhappy. And like last week I want us to begin by reading our text for this series, Psalm 39:4-7: LORD, remind me how brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered how fleeting my life is. You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand. My entire lifetime is just a moment to you; at best, each of us is but a breath. We are merely moving shadows, and all our busy rushing ends in nothing. We heap up wealth, not knowing who will spend it. And so, Lord, where do I put my hope? My only hope is in you. (NLT) I believe one of the things that is clear in this Psalm is that our happiness is found in the Lord. Our hope and happiness is in God. Our joy is found in the abundant life God desires for us, if we choose to live it. Thats the key, isnt it? We must choose to live it. God gives us free will. We can choose to be happy and hopeful in the Lord or we can choose not to be. The sad truth is people actually choose not to be happy. Drive by a cemetery next week and look at all the tombstones. As you do, I want you to remember something: Every single day people die unhappy. Now, let me ask you, Do you think they planned that? Do you think they said to themselves, I want to have an unhappy life.? Did they wake up and think, I hope my life is bland, meaningless, and full of fear? Heck no! Do you think God wanted them to live life like that? Heck no! Yet every single day people die unhappy. Why? Because they choose to be unhappy. Now, it is usually not, I will choose to be unhappy! I will choose to live an unhappy life! Its more insidious than that. Its the little choices that are made every day that add up to an unhappy life. What most people dont realize is that our daily choices accumulate. When we choose bland, meaningless, fear, negativity, criticism, day in and day out it eventually it all adds up to an unhappy and miserable life. This is why happiness hope in the Lord must be a daily decision. We are the sum total of our daily decisions. Here is the truth: You are what you do, not what you hope youll do (thedailypositive.com). So today I want to shoot straight with you and give you some helpful advice on how to live a happy and hopeful life in the Lord. If you do what I am going to suggest to you, you will find yourself living the life youve always wanted  a happy, hopeful, healthy life in the Lord. Dont Believe Everything You Think! I believe in counseling. I believe everyone should have a counselor. I counsel people as a pastor. I go to a counselor from time to time. The old adage is true, A counselor without a counselor has a fool for a client. How can I be an effective counselor for you unless I am also being counseled? If I had to summarize everything I have learned by counseling others and being counseled in one sentence it would be: Dont Believe Everything You Think! Not every thought that pops into your head is worthy of your time and energy. All of your thoughts do not hold the same value. Some are myths and lies. We cant stop thoughts from entering our minds but we can choose which thoughts we will focus on. Question your thoughts and choose to focus on the thoughts that are healthy, happy and true. Folks we become what we think about. Our thoughts determine our beliefs and our beliefs determine our actions. So the bottom line is that you are the sum total of your own thoughts. In many ways, you are where you are today because thats exactly where you think you should be. We live off the fruit of our thoughts! Therefore, if you want to live a happy life you have to change the way you think and what you think! I want us to take a look at something Jesus said about this in the gospel of Matthew. Take a look: No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak, for the patch pulls away from the cloak, and a worse tear is made. Neither is new wine put into old wineskins; otherwise, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are destroyed; but new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved. Matthew 9:16-17 Jesus is telling us that we cant put new wine into old wineskins. Wineskins were made out of leather. When they got old, they became crusty, hard and stiff, and wouldnt expand. Sounds like some people I know! If you put new wine in them they would burst. One of the truths of this text is you cant have a new life with old thinking. If you want a new life filled with happiness and joy, you cant do it with old thinking. You cant go around thinking you are not worthy enough or good enough. Limited thinking will cause you to live a limited life. Negative thinking will cause you to live a negative life. But positive thinking will lead to a positive life. If you want to change your life you have to change your thoughts. Heres one for you? What do Albert Einstein, Oprah Winfrey, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Michael Jordan and the Beatles have in common? They are started off as complete failures but chose not to see themselves as failures: -Einstein could not speak until he was four years old and his teachers said he wouldnt amount to much. -Walt Disney was fired from his newspaper for lacking imagination and having no original ideas. -Oprah Winfrey was demoted from her job as news anchor because they said she wasnt fit for television. -Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team and locked himself in his room and cried. -Steve Jobs, at 30 was left dejected and depressed after being removed from the company that he started. -The Beatles were rejected by Decca Recording Studios because they didnt like their sound and felt they had no future in show business. Dont Believe Everything You Hear! Recently I read about a famous experiment with 4 monkeys. The scientists placed them in a room with a large pole in the center. At the top of the pole was a bunch of bananas. The first monkey hurried up the pole, so excited. He couldnt wait to get the bananas. But just when he was about to reach for one, a large bucket of cold water was poured on him. He scurried down that pole as fast as he could. He didnt want to have anything to do with those bananas. After a few minutes, the second monkey went up. The same thing happened. Cold water was poured on him. He turned around and ran back down. Over the next hour, the other 2 monkeys went up. But, once again, they were doused with water and came running back down. Day after day went by. Even though those monkeys loved bananas, they wouldnt dare go up that pole. At that point, the researchers removed one monkey and brought a new monkey in. This new monkey started going up the pole. When he did, the other 3 monkeys grabbed him, pulled him down, and wouldnt let him go up. He tried again and again and again. They wouldnt let him. Finally, he gave up and quit trying. Researchers brought in another monkey and removed an original one. Same thing. When he went up, the 3 other monkeys grabbed him. Eventually, the room was filled with dozens of monkeys. None of them the original. None of them had felt the dousing of water. But, not one of them would go up that pole. They didnt know why; they just knew they couldnt have those bananas. Sometimes were like those monkeys. We want the bananas. We want a happy life. We want to live our dreams. We want to be hopeful and positive. But we let other people pull us down and throw water on our dreams and passions. We listen to their negativity and criticism. They are miserable and we allow them to make us miserable. Dont let them to do that you! Just because they are miserable does not mean you have to miserable! They choose to be miserable. You choose to be happy and get your bananas! Life is too short to be unhappy so dont let the monkeys pull you down! Go get your bananas! Live your dreams! Live the abundant life God wants for you! I heard an interesting story about a 6 year old boy who was given an assignment at school. He and his classmates had to write down what they wanted to be when they grew up. He had seen a man on television that was very funny. That was his dream as a little boy. He knew he wanted to be on television making people laugh so he wrote it down. He came from a low-income family, wore hand-me-down clothes, plus he had a problem with stuttering. The teacher started calling out the kids names out loud and reading what they had written down. But, when she came to his, she stopped and said, Stevie, will you please come up here? He walked to the front of the class so proud, thinking that she was going to encourage him, cheer him on. It was just the opposite. She said, Stevie, what did you write down? He said, I wrote down that I want to be on television making people laugh. She said, Now Stevie do you know anybody on television? He said, No maam. She said, Stevie has anyone in your family ever been on television? He said, No maam. She said, Then you need to take this back and write down something more realistic. As a 6 year old body, he was confused. Up to that point, nobody had ever told him what he couldnt become. I am sure his teacher meant well but like those monkeys she was pulling him down. That night Stevie told his father what had happened. He showed him the paper where he had written down he wanted to be on television. His father said, Stevie put this is your top drawer. Every morning before you go to school, every night before you go to bed, you get this paper out and read it and thank God that one day you will be on television. He did that, day after day and year after year after year. So today, all these years later, Steve Harvey is on television 7 days a week making people laugh. He is the host of Family Feud and does other numerous things in show business making people laugh. Dont let the monkeys of life keep you from the abundant life God wants from you! Throw those monkeys off your back! Live your life with joy and hope. Life is just too short! You are not what people say you can or cannot become. You are what God says you can become. What if Moses, Abraham, David, Paul, and Peter had listened to and believed their detractors? What if Jesus had listened to and believed his detractors? Dont believe everything you hear! Believe that You Can One of my favorite gospel stories is when Jesus told Peter to launch out into the deep and cast his nets into the sea for a big catch. Peter didnt believe he could catch anything. He said, Jesus, we fished all night and we didnt catch anything! Its not going to happen! We are not going to catch anything! But at the last minute Peter changed his mind and let down his net. And do you remember what happened? He caught so many fish that his net began to break. Sometime we are a lot like Peter. God wants an amazing, abundant and joyous life for us, but we dont believe it. We dont think it can happen. But all we have to do is let down our nets and we can experience the life God wants for us! What does it mean to let down our nets? It means to make room for Gods intention for us. It means to make room for Gods joy in our lives. It means to take a step toward where we find our joy and energy! Where is your joy? Cast your nets in that direction and you will find what God has in store for you! You will find that God will open doors that you could never open. You will meet people you never thought you could meet. He will take you and your life to places beyond your expectations. So start letting down your nets? Start that business. Launch that ministry. Write that book and send it to the editor. Ask God for a husband or a wife. Who know what you will catch? I let down my net a little over a month ago and I cant believe what I caught! Some of you know that I teach preaching to candidates for ministry and local pastors. I really enjoy it. I love preaching and I love to teach preaching. Go figure! Anyway, about two years ago I started to write a book on preaching based on my lecture notes. I didnt think much of it. I really didnt think a publisher would be interested in it so I put it aside. But something kept bringing back to my book. I believe it was God. No, I know it was God. I kept thinking about the book. So about a little over a month ago I decided to let down my net and sent Abingdon Press what little I had written. It wasnt even an official proposal. It was just the introduction to the book and a paragraph in an email explaining the book. I didnt know a soul at Abingdon. I found their website and randomly sent it to an associate editor. I didnt expect to ever hear anything. Publishers get tons and tons of unsolicited manuscripts. Well, about ten minutes later the associate editor emailed me and told me he had forwarded my proposal to a senior editor. A few hours later the senior editor emailed me and said they were interested and wanted me to send them more. I didnt have more! So I had to feverishly write more! A few days later I sent the senior editor what else I had written. That same day she emailed me and said they were really interested and she was going to present it to "

Just return to the Father today and ask him for his love and forgiveness. And you can begin your new life today! God created you and wants you to experience his love for you. Start seeing yourself the way God sees you! And start living the abundant life he wants for you. How would you live your life tomorrow if you knew it was going to be your last day? Why not live like that every day? A couple of years ago I was in Atlanta doing doctoral work. It was over a weekend and I had a Sunday off. I woke up that Sunday morning and was exhausted. It was raining outside and I did not have my usual pep. I found a church in which to worship. The minister gave a good sermon. In the sermon he told a true story about himself that I will never forget. He recalled the time his grandfather died. He loved his grandfather very much. He was a strong Christian with a loving spirit. The minister said that his grandfather gave him the encouragement he needed to become a minister. As he sat at his grandfathers bedside, his grandfather handed him a crinkled up piece of paper. His grandfather was very weak and could not speak, but the minister he knew it was a note from his grandfather. Moments later, his grandfather died. The minister said he vividly remembers walking out of the hospital room with tears in his eyes opening up that crinkled piece of paper. Inside were five words written in pencil by his grandfather: Always remember who you are. You are a child of God. You are loved by God. God wants you to have an abundant life. Now live like it. Life is too short to live any other way. I want to end with a poem that puts it all in perspective for us: The Dash I read of a reverend who stood to speak at the funeral of a friend. He referred to the dates on her tombstone from the beginning ... to the end. He noted that first came the date of her birth and spoke of the following date with tears, But he said what mattered most of all was the dash between those years. For that dash represents all the time that she spent alive on earth, And now only those who loved her know what that little line is worth. For it matters not how much we own, the cars, the house, the cash. What matters is how we live and love and how we spend our dash. So think about this long and hard. Are there things youd like to change? For you never know how much time is left. You could be at dash mid-range. If we could just slow down enough to consider whats true and real And always try to understand the way other people feel. And be less quick to anger and show appreciation more And love the people in our lives like weve never loved before. If we treat each other with respect and more often wear a smile, Remembering that this special dash might only last a little while. So when your eulogy is being read with your lifes actions to rehash, Would you be proud of the things they say about how you spent your dash? -Poem by Linda Ellis (lindaslyrics.com) Pasadena Community Church Life is Too Short to Waste Time Psalm 39: 4 -Sunday, November 8, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Life has a way of presenting us with defining moments. I remember facing a defining moment in my ministry. I went to see a man in the hospital who was dying. He was not active in the church I was serving, but I knew who he was. When I entered his hospital room, his whole family was standing in a semi-circle around his bed. They greeted me, and then the man told his family that he wanted a moment alone with me. So they left us alone. As soon as his family had left, he began to cry. I sat by his bed and began to stroke his hand while he expressed his grief. After a few minutes, I asked him, Are you afraid? He said, No. I feel sure that death will not separate me from Christ. Then I said, Then you must be sad about leaving your family. He replied, Yeah, but thats not what is bothering me. Then what exactly is it? I asked. He turned his head away from me, lifted his eyes to hold back the tears, and said four words that still haunt me to this day: I wasted my life. Then he began to tell me how he did not do the things he should have done  how he squandered his gifts on possessions, drugs, and alcohol  how he could have done so much more with the life God had given him  how he did not follow the path God had for him. I told him that the grace of God was big enough to cover his regrets. Yet as I left the hospital room, I thought how tragic it would be to come to the end of your life and realize you have wasted it. Imagine for a moment that your life is over, and you are led into a small room. In this room there are two chairs; one for you and one for God (guess who gets the larger chair?). In front of these two chairs are a television and a DVD player. Imagine God coming into the room with a DVD labeled with your name and the title, What Might Have Been. Imagine sitting in that room with God and watching the DVD share all that God might have done with your life if you had let him. Imagine seeing what God might have done with your financial resources if you had generously trusted him. Imagine seeing what God might have done with your talents and gifts if you had stepped out in faith and used them. Imagine seeing what God might have done with your relationships if you had given him room to work. Imagine seeing what God might have done with you if you had confronted sin and yielded to Gods empowering grace. Now, I dont know if God will make us watch a video titled What Might Have Been. I hopenot.Itwouldberathercruel.And Iamnot asking you to do this exercise so you will wallow in self-defeat. But I have asked you to do this because we have only one chance to fulfill Gods dream for us. So let me get straight to the point: What have you done with your life up to this point? Do you feel like you have not taken advantage of the life God has given you? Well, take heart, because as long as you have breath, it is not too late. At this very moment, you can make things better! Life is too short to waste time! The psalmist puts it quite well in Psalm 39:4-7: LORD, remind me how brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered how fleeting my life is. You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand. My entire lifetime is just a moment to you; at best, each of us is but a breath.

(NLT) Bronnie Ware was a caretaker for the dying. She became very close to the people she was comforting. Ware quickly discovered that when people are faced with their own mortality they are no longer afraid to be vulnerable. In fact, many people would share their regrets with Ware. She was surprised to hear the same regrets over and over again. She was so taken by these repeated regrets from such a wide range of people that she decided to publish an article on the internet about it. She calls it, The Five Regrets. And I can tell you as a pastor who has ministered quite a bit to the dying that she is spot on: 1. I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me. This was the most common regret of all. When folks reach the end of their lives they realize all the dreams they never fulfilled. Now, of course, we can never fulfill all our dreams but many hardly try to fulfill even one! Sometimes it is because of choices to fulfill the expectations of others. Sometimes it is because of fear. So what is holding you back from doing something you love, that you have dreamed of doing? Do it now! Life is too darn short! Publish a book? Skydive? Life may be real short if you do that! Get out of that career and do something you really feel called to do? Start a ministry you have always wanted to do? Do it now! God often works through our dreams and passions. Everything worthwhile in the world began as a dream. Ware writes, It is very important to try and honor at least some of your dreams along the way. When you lose your health, it is too late. Health brings great freedom. But many folks dont realize how great that freedom is until they no longer have it. 2. I wish I didn't work so hard. Man, is this the truth? I have never heard anyone tell me on their death bed that they wish they had spent more time at the office. Yet, how many folks live their lives obsessed with work? Dont get me wrong. Work can be fulfilling and productive but some folks let it take over their lives and their priorities. Ballet recitals and baseball games are missed. Romantic dates are missed. Worshipping with family is missed. When I counsel couples and families in trouble it is not always affairs or addictions that are the culprits; it is the obsession with work. You were not here when we needed you! I love the quote by the Dhali Lama: Mansacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived. Jesus said, Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life? Matthew 6:25-27 I know the reality is we have to work. Im not saying that work is not important. We like to eat and pay our bills. What I am suggesting is all of us can simplify our lives. All of us can take inventory and invest in what and who we care about and spend less time on those things that dont really matter in the end. What changes do you need to make so you can make time for what is most important? How can you simplify your life? Yesterday we had Dwight McCormicks funeral. He was a pillar of this church  a man of great character and integrity. He also had a great sense of humor and told wonderful jokes that I could never repeat, at least not in the pulpit! I remember Dwight taking me aside one time and giving me some great advice. I had just told him how busy things were at the church. He said to me, Charley, life is too precious to work so hard that you dont have time to enjoy it. You take that beautiful wife of yours and go on vacation. It is just not worth it. 3. I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings. Ware writes about the dying, Many people suppressed their feelings in order to keep peace with others. Many developed illnesses relating to the bitterness and resentment they carried as a result. We cannot control the reactions of others. However, although people may initially react when you change the way you are by speaking honestly, in the end it raises the relationship to a whole new and healthier level. Either that or it releases the unhealthy relationship from your life. Either way, you win. Amen! Folks, life is too darn short not to express how you feel. Now, dont be a jerk about it. Speak the truth in love. But there is nothing more exhausting than insincerity. There is nothing more exhausting than being less than real. Be the person God made you to be and express yourself. Ask my staff. They will tell you that the best thing about me is that they never have to wonder where I stand. They always know how I feel about something. I am pretty clear. Look at the Bible. Jesus spoke his mind. So did Thomas and Paul. Look at the Psalmist. He spoke his mind. So did the Prophets! The writers of the Bible were not afraid to express their feelings. We shouldnt be either! 4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. Ware writes of the dying, Often they would not truly realize the full benefits of old friends until their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track them down. Many had become so caught up in their own lives that they had let golden friendships slip by over the years. There were many deep regrets about not giving friendships the time and effort that they deserved. Everyone misses their friends when they are dying. It is common for anyone in a busy lifestyle to let friendships slip. But when you are faced with your approaching death, the physical details of life fall away. People do want to get their financial affairs in order if possible. But it is not money or status that holds the true importance for them. They want to get things in order more for the benefit of those they love. Usually though, they are too ill and weary to ever manage this task. It is all comes down to love and relationships in the end. That is all that remains in the final weeks, love and relationships. Ware is right. It really all comes down to love and relationships. Why cant we live our lives out of that knowledge every day? The Apostle Paul said it so well: If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothingNow faith, hope and love, abide these three. But the greatest of these is love. -1st Corinthians 13:1-3,13 5. I wish that I had let myself be happier. Ware writes, This is a surprisingly common one. Many did not realize until the end that happiness is a choice. They had stayed stuck in old patterns and habits. The so-called 'comfort' of familiarity overflowed into their emotions, as well as their physical lives. Fear of change had them pretending to others, and to their selves, that they were content. When deep within, they longed to laugh properly and have silliness in their life again. When you are on your deathbed, what others think of you is a long way from your mind. How wonderful to be able to let go and smile again, long before you are dying. Life is a choice. It is YOUR life. Choose consciously, choose wisely, choose honestly. Choose happiness. Whats holding you back from living the dreams God has put on your heart, simplifying your life, speaking your mind, making love and relationships a priority and allowing yourself to be happy? Because Ill tell you one thing, God wants all of that for you! The climactic scene in the Parable of Prodigal Son says it all: So he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him. his father said to the servants, Quick! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet. 23 And kill the calf we have been fattening. We must celebrate with a feast, for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost, but now he is found. So the party began. -Luke 15:20, 22-24 You want to know one of the morals of this story: You can go home again! Have you lost your way? Have you forgotten your worth? Have you lost sight of the life you want to live? Have you forgotten who you are? Is your life broken? Just run back to the Heavenly Father and he will be running toward you! He is ready to throw his arms around you and tell the Angels to get the party "

Why do we give? Because the church is Gods best hope for the world! The church is not about you or about me. The church is not about your agenda or my agenda. It is about the communication of the gospel to the next generation. It is about the people who arent yet here who need Jesus. The church is about the little children who run around here who one day will have families of their own. I saw tomorrow in our children today. Maybe one of these kids will discover the cure to cancer. Maybe one of these kids will be a preacher or missionary. Maybe one of these kids will be the President of the United States. Who knows? But one thing we do know is that they will need the church! Why do we give? Because the church is Gods best hope for the world! There is an old legend told about Zacchaeus. You remember Zacchaeus. He was short so he climbed a tree to see Jesus in a crowd. Jesus told him to get down from the tree because he was coming over to his house. Jesus transformed his heart and he was never the same again. The legend goes that after his conversion it was Zacchaeus habit to rise early and leave home for a while with a rake and shovel. Mrs. Zacchaeus noticed this one day and asked, Where are you going? Zacchaeus replied, Do you remember that old sycamore tree I was in when Jesus found me? Well, Im going to take care of it. It has been neglected by the city fathers and needs my care. You see, it held me so Jesus could find me (Self, p.79). of you the church has been the tree that held you so Jesus could find you and love you. The church was there for you because people were willing to give generously. Now, it is our turn. Why should we give? Because the church holds people so Jesus can find them. The church loves people so Jesus can save them. The church cares for people so Jesus can empower them. The church supports people so Jesus can call them. When you fill out your pledge card, remember WHY: the church is Gods best hope for the world!

It was a defining moment in our nations history. 250,000 people gathered in Washington that day. Keep in mind that no invitations were given out and there was no web-site to check the date and time of the event. And, of course, no one had a smart phone in their pocket! Yet, 250,000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to make history. How did that happen? How did King do it? He wasnt the only civil rights leader at the time. He wasnt the only great preacher at the time, either. How did he do it? A better question is why? Simon Sinek reminds us that King had a gift for sharing what he believed and why he believed it. He knew if enough people understood why he was doing what he was doing they would join him in his cause. King was right. 250,000 people did not show up for King; they showed up for themselves because they believed what King believed. In fact, about 25 percent of the audience was white. Sinek reminds us that MLK gave his I have a dream speech not his I have a plan speech! He didnt share the what or the how of his movement; he shared the why. Sinek says all great leaders who inspire action know they must start with why before people will be motivated to act on what they believe. Why is a question of the heart. When people know why and believe in why they will do anything for why. I have come to the place in my ministry where I have learned this lesson. People dont commit to anything until they know why they should commit. What people do reflects what they believe. I have learned that people dont commit to what you do; they commit to why you do it. This is why we this years stewardship campaign is called Saints Alive!  Living Generously! When we as the church know why we should give we will come alive and give generously. We will give from the heart. Watch out! When you discover why, your generosity may even surprise you! This morning I want to tell you why you should give generously to the church. I am willing to bet that no one has really answered that question for you. Sure, youve heard preachers raise money for this building project or that program or ministry. And I am sure you have heard sermons on generosity  how it is better to give than to your receive. Some of you have been through your fair share of slick stewardship campaigns with letters and goals and slogans. And some of you have grown up learning biblical concepts of giving and tithing. But I bet no one has really given you a good reason why you should invest your hard earned money in the church. Why? It is a great question. You get letters and emails from colleges asking for money. Non are always asking for donations. Your kids school is asking for money. The Girl Scouts are always selling those delicious cookies. You have kids selling chocolate bars for worthy projects. On and on it goes. And then you get a letter from the church asking for you to pledge money. And then the preacher gets up on Sunday morning and asks for money. Really? You cant possibly give money to every worthy organization. There are lots of good ones out there, but you cant give to every one of them. You would go broke! So why, in the midst of all the requests for financial support, should you pledge your financial support to the church? Why should you invest your money and time in the church? Is there a good reason why? Well, this morning I am going to tell you why you should invest your money in Pasadena Community Church. The reason why is really quite simple but for some reason you dont often hear why. Why often gets lost in the midst of details, plans and budgets. But why is the most important question because people dont give to what; they give to why! When you hear why this morning you will never think twice about giving to the church again. When you hear why you should give your money to the church you may wonder why you didnt give sooner  you may wonder why you have not invested more! When you hear why you may think, I wonder why I didnt get this before. It is so simple, so true, so powerful  why dont more people know this? Hearing why just may change how you view the church. The Apostle Paul would underscore the powerful role of the church by making a simple but profound statement about the church. It appears in 1st Corinthians 12:27: All of you together are Christs body, and each of you is a part of it. This means we are the hands and feet of Christ in this world! The Spirit of Christ works through us to do ministry. Christ is the head and we are the body. When we fully understand Pauls words we come to the realization that Pasadena Community Church is not a charity organization or an event center or a concert hall or a recreational center. We are the body of Christ! We are living saints! We are Gods chosen vessel in the world! God has chosen the church to be his change agent in the world. So I am going to make it very clear and simple this morning. Why should you fill out a pledge card and give to the church? The Church is Gods best hope for the world! Christ died for the church, so we should be shepherds of the church and take care of the church. We should never neglect it. God created the church to be His vessel in the world. A close reading of history shows that when God does anything significant in this world, it is not done through politics, talk radio, fads, or through secular institutions; it is done through the church! Through the Saints! We must come alive! I know what some people are thinking. What about all the bad things the church has done over the years? Maybe you have a neighbor or relative that comes over to your house every holiday and criticizes the church. Perhaps they bring up the same litany every year  the Inquisition, the Salem witch trials, the corruption and abuse of clergy, etc. Maybe some of them tell you they used to go to church but they got their finger caught in the machinery of the church and have never been back. Someone got mad at them or they got mad at someone and, to their surprise, they discovered that the church is made up of imperfect people! Allow me to let the cat out of the bag for you this morning. The church is made up of imperfect people because, as the old saying goes, the church is a hospital for sinners, not a museum for saints. There is no such thing as the perfect church. I often find people who are searching for the perfect church. My response is always the same: There is no such thing as the perfect church. But if you find the perfect church and join it, it will not be perfect anymore! The church is not perfect because it is made up of human beings. However, the church is still the greatest thing God has going for Him in this world and if God is going to do something profound in this world He will do it through His church. I love the church. I love the Church universal and the church local. This is why I give generously to the church. I love walking into the sanctuary on Sunday mornings and seeing the joy on peoples faces. I love listening to the choir and praise band sing. I love watching the ushers and greeters greet visitors with warmth and friendliness. I love walking around this church property at night looking at our cross shine its light in the darkness. It reminds me we are a beacon in this community. Are we perfect? No. But we know the one who is perfect and we know that He can be trusted. We point the way to Him. I love the church. This is why when people talk bad about the church, I take it personally. I feel like they are criticizing my own family. Dont mess with my family! Everything I am I owe to God and His church. The church raised me through the nursery and Sunday school. The church nurtured me as a teenager. The church supported me and encouraged me when God called me to preach. The church supported me financially through college, seminary and through my doctoral work. I stand here before you today because of the church and because people were willing to give generously to the church. You see, the gospel is not something that just floats around on its own. It is rooted, sustained, supported and organized by the church through the power of Holy Spirit. It is easy to get people saved, but the church keeps people saved. Dont let that mess up your theology. What I am saying is that there is no such thing as an isolated Christian. I dont know any Christian who is growing and serving effectively who is not active in a local church. Sometimes I come across people who think they can grow as a Christian without being part of a church. They claim to love Jesus, but they say they dont need to be active in a church. This is biblically impossible! Once you receive Christ as Savior you are grafted into the body of Christ. Paul addresses this issue in 1st Corinthians 12 when he tells us the church is like a body and the ear never says to the foot that it has no need for it. No, we all play a key role in the body of Christ and we need each other. Together, by the power of God, we achieve more for God. This is why the church is Gods best hope for the world! Bill Self reminds us that the church was in the inner cities long before the activists were. The church was into education before the government. Harvard, Yale, and Princeton were originally started for the purpose of educating clergy. The church has been feeding the hungry and creating community while general culture was debating political agendas and power. It was the church that broke down the Berlin Wall, led the March on Selma, produced Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement, and it was the church that led the War on Poverty (Bill Self, Surviving the Stained Glass Jungle, p.79). The church has been able to move mountains despite opposition, attacks, and the work of evil. Paul tells us in our text for today that savage wolves will try to come in and destroy the church. But all these attacks will never overcome the church because God created the church and His power works through us. Remember Jesus said the gates of hell will not prevail against the church. The church is infinitely stronger than most people understand. Self reminds us again that the church has survived Roman Imperialismpagan optimism, medieval institutionalismwars and rumors of wars. The church has survived modern skepticism, Southern provincialism, fundamentalism, post-modernism, and heresies in every generation.the church has survived incompetent clergy, tone deaf musicians, manipulative members, argumentative leaders, demanding denominations, unloving reformers, and greedy politicians (Surviving the Stained Glass Jungle, p.80). It can withstand anything the world throws at it because it is sustained and empowered by God! Still, the church thrives and provides love, affirmation and community to the left out, down and out, thrown out and the bruised, broken, and beaten. It changes lives with the gospel of Jesus Christ! I must confess a sin to you. When I get around the community and hear people talk about the great things our church is doing I am guilty of the sin of pride. I am so proud of this church. I think God makes allowances for that kind of pride. Our church is changing lives with the gospel! Whenever I see hungry people take food home from our food pantry, I want to shout, This is why we give! When I meet a waitress who tells me she learned to speak English at our church and it has made such a difference to her life, I want to shout, This is why we give! When I speak with couples who tell me that their marriage was saved by the ministries of our church, I want to shout, This is why we give! When I see people come down this aisle to receive Christ as Lord and Savior, I want to shout, This is why we give! When I see a young child at Gulfport Elementary light up when they see one of our mentors, I want to shout, This is why we give! When I see our children singing about the love of Jesus in their hearts, I want to shout, This is why we give! To critics of the church I ask, What other "

No, we all play a key role in the body of Christ and we need each other. Together, by the power of God, we achieve more for God. The gospel is not something that just floats around on its own. It is rooted, sustained, supported and organized by the church through the power of Holy Spirit. It is my conviction that everybody ought to know that God is love. Everybody ought to know that Jesus saves. Everybody ought to know the power of forgiveness. Everybody ought to know that trouble does not last forever. Everyone ought to know the joy of serving others. How can they know unless there is a community of faith that is bold enough to point to Christ as the answer? Howard Olds once said, The Church can be a mighty force for good moving people toward faith, hope, and love. It can sound the trumpet for peace above the rumblings of war. It can call attention to the least when everybody is wanting more. My question is: If you are a Christian, give me a darn good reason why you dont want to be a part of that! #5 -They are always asking for money. I remember someone coming up to me in another church I served and saying, It is a lot easier to be a visitor of a church than a member, isnt it? As a visitor you get the best parking spaces. You are not obligated to serve on a committee or serve a project. Most of all, you dont feel pressured to give money or turn in a pledge card. I said, You are right! The Church is not a country club. Anyone can receive the benefits of our church with no pressure of commitment. We do not charge people when they walk in the door. Our services and ministries are free. So why would anyone in their right mind assume responsibility for the church? Those of you who have made a commitment to the church know why. Deep down you want to be committed to a partnership that is making a difference in the world. Deep down you want to be part of a body of people that is transforming this world with the love of Christ. And you know the church needs your resources to make it happen. The inscription on the Statue of Liberty says, Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Those words need to be inscribed on the door of every church. That is what the Church is about. Why go to church? Why be active in a church? Because the church is Gods best hope for the world and the church cant be the church without your commitment. Amen. Pasadena Community Church Saints Alive! Living Generously (Part 2) John 15: Sunday, October 18, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.  John 15:5 Jesus is very clear in our text for today. If we, as the church, will abide in him we will bear fruit. Christ is the vine and we are the branches. The branches represent the church. As the church, we are intimately connected to Christ and nourished by him to bear fruit. Notice Jesus does not say we might bear fruit or we should bear fruit or there is a possibility we will bear fruit. Jesus does not say that if the weather is right we will bear fruit or if it is convenient we will bear fruit. No. Jesus says if we are truly followers of his we will grow and bear fruit. We will grow in our faith and find our mission. The problem in our culture today is that fewer and fewer Christians see the church the way Christ sees the church. Fewer and fewer Christians love the church the way God loves the church. Fewer and fewer Christians have a commitment to the church and make growing in their faith a priority. The biggest issue confronting the church today is not immorality, sin, worship wars, ethical issues, polity, or corruption. The biggest issue confronting the church today is the growing lack of commitment among the followers of Jesus Christ! We have plenty of admirers of Jesus  those who will tip their hat to Jesus from time to time  those who call themselves fans and throw a dollar in the plate twice a year. But Jesus does not want fans; Jesus wants followers. Jesus does not want admirers; Jesus wants disciples. For many Christians, commitment to Christ and the church is seen as somewhat of a hobby, an option when the mood is right. If we dont have weekend plans we will do God a favor and make it to worship.If the kids dont have soccer or we dont get a better offer we will sign up to serve some ministry as long as it fits our scheduleAnd if we have some money left over after our trips and toys, we may give some of it to the churchOh and pastor I know I havent been active in the church for awhile and I gave up that Bible study because I lost interest, but I dont feel very close to God right nowI have thirty minutes. Can you fix me in thirty minutes? I agree with the late George Buttrick who said, Sheep are usually not stolen from the flock, they just nibble themselves away. Too many Christians base their commitment to Christ and the church on whether or not they feel like it. Can you imagine what would happen if the rest of the world operated that way? Imagine the fireman saying, I just dont feel like putting out fires today. Imagine the surgeon saying, I just dont feel like performing surgery today. Imagine the tired mother awakened in the middle of the night by a crying baby saying, I just dont feel like feeding the baby. The world would come to a screeching halt! Yet, when it comes to serving the King of Kings, many folks do it only when they feel like it. So how are you doing? What is your level of commitment? Those of you who joined the church took a vow. You said you would support your church with your prayers, presence, gifts, ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org service and witness. How are you doing with that? Christ died for us and set us free! Do we really have to ponder whether or not we should be faithful? Do we really have to give a second thought to whether or not we should abide in him and grow in our faith? You see, somewhere along the line the paradigm shifted within the church. I believe it has happened over the last 30 years or so as consumerism has taken over our culture. The predominant attitude of the church today is not being the body of Christ in the world or making disciples or being a beacon of hope in the midst of a dark world. The predominant attitude in the church today is Its all about me! It is comical when you put it in perspective. What if I ran out to Tropicana Field today and asked to see the manager of the stadium and said, I am giving up baseball. I am never coming here again and I am going to tell you why: Every time I went they asked me for money. The people I sat next to weren't very friendly and didn't speak to me. The seats were too hard and not very comfortable. I went to many games but the coach never came to visit me. The coach made a decision that I didn't like. I dont like the food and concessions you offer. Too much junk and not enough salad. Some games went into overtime and I had to wait in line at the restaurant. The music you play between innings is too loud and I have never heard it before. It seems like the games are always scheduled when I want to do something else. I recently read a book on sports, and now I feel that I know more than the coaches do anyhow. Can you imagine? We laugh, but do you realize that is the attitude many people have about the church? It is all about them. They want to come to the show but they dont want to grow. Somehow the church has turned inward and become a glorified event center -catering to everyones needs. Now, there is a place in the church for meeting needs, but, folks, not every need is healthy or important. Sometimes the churchs job is to say, That need is really not important. What you really need is to get off your behind and serve Jesus. That will fix half of your problems! Of course, people will stake make excuses, and I have a heard every one in the book. In fact, I want to lift up the top five excuses I have heard for not committing to the church. And I am about to debunk each one! Hold on to your seats because I have something to offend everyone! #1 -I believe in God; I am spiritual. I just dont believe in organized religion. I hear this quite a bit. In fact, not a month goes by when I dont hear this a few times as I get out into the community. If I am in a salty mood, my response is usually, You dont believe in organized religion? What you would like instead? Unorganized religion? The truth is unorganized religion is no match for organized evil! Evil is out there and believe me it is organized. How are we to overcome it if we are unorganized? We romanticize organized crime, dont we? We have TV shows, movies and books glorifying organized crime. We think it is fascinating. Yet, some people are turned off by the people of God organizing themselves to bring hope and healing to the world? When there is a natural disaster, we expect FEMA and The Red Cross to be organized. When there is a threat to our country, we expect our military to be organized. When our country has needs, we expect the government to be organized. When we go to the bank to withdraw money, we expect it to be organized. When we go to our favorite grocery store or restaurant, we expect it to be organized, or we will go to another place that is. When we check into the hospital for surgery, we expect the doctors and nurses to be organized! Yet, when the one institution in the world that is called and ordained by God to heal the world gets organized people are turned off by it? Given the sufferings of this world and what God has called the church to do, the church should be the most organized institution in the world! Because we have the most important job in the world  to be vessels of Gods love, hope and healing! A close reading of history shows that when God does anything significant in this world it is not done through politics, talk radio, fads, or through secular institutions; it is done through the organized body of Christ. #2 -The Church is filled with a bunch of hypocrites. Maybe you have a neighbor or relative that comes over to your house every holiday and criticizes the church. Perhaps they bring up the same litany  the Inquisition, the Salem witch trials, the corruption of clergy, etc. Maybe some of them tell you they used to go to church but they got their fingers caught in the machinery of the church and have never been back. Someone got mad at them or they got mad at someone and, to their surprise, they discovered that the church is made up of imperfect people. Allow me to let the cat out of the bag for you this morning. The church is made up of imperfect people because, as the old saying goes, the church is a hospital for sinners, not a museum for saints. There is no such thing as the perfect church. I often find people who are searching for the perfect church. My response is always the same: There is no such thing as the perfect church. But if you find the perfect church and join it, it will not be perfect anymore! Why did Jesus come? Think about it. Jesus did not come for perfect people. He came for imperfect people. You dont need a bath if you are clean. Jesus came to seek and save the lost  to bring healing and wholeness to broken people. The church is not perfect, but we know the one who is perfect and he is working in our lives. Even though the church is not perfect, she is still the greatest thing God has going for Him in this world and if God is going to do something profound in this world He will do it through His church. Through our imperfections, the power of God is revealed. #3 -I can experience God on the golf course or in the mountains or on the beach. This one always reminds me of that old joke about the preacher who wanted to play golf on Sunday instead of preach. He called his associate on Saturday night and feigned sickness. His associate graciously agreed to preach. The next morning the preacher got up, threw his clubs into his car and drove to the golf course. When he got to the first par 3 he struck the ball perfectly and it dropped into the hole for a hole in one! St. Peter looked up at God and asked, Why would you allow one of your ministers who is playing hooky to get a hole in one? God replied, Peter, who is he going to tell? Number three is a popular one. I hear it quite a bit. I dont doubt it. I believe we can experience God in creation. However, sooner or later in life each of us will need the wisdom, support, love, connection and accountability of others. And when that need arises where do we go? I never heard of a golf course that saved a marriage. I never heard of a mountain that helped someone overcome an addiction. I never heard of a beach that helped someone find answers to their most troubling questions. I never heard of boat that helped someone develop a growing relationship with Jesus Christ. But you know what? I know that the church has done all these things! What happened after 9/11? Did people run to the mountains, play golf, or go to the beach? No! They went to church! People who never darkened the door of a church before in their lives flocked to church. Why? Because they needed hope. They needed the touch and love of understanding people. Most of all, they needed a strength and a wisdom beyond themselves. They needed God. And they knew the church was the only institution in the world that could provide what they needed. The questions are always the same: Why do bad things happen to good people? Where is God when it hurts? What is the purpose of my life? Where is the answer to the riddle of suffering? Why is hate so strong? How come good people go bad? Where do you go when you have these questions? You go to church? You need to connect to real loving people who know a real loving God. #4  I can be a Christian without going to church. Sure, you can be a Christian without going to church, but not a very good one! I dont know any Christian who is growing and serving effectively who is not active in a local church. In fact, I challenge anyone to find me one person who is a healthy Christian who is not active in a church. We will never achieve Christian maturity apart from Christian community. We need more than our own frame of reference. We need more influence than just a few like minded friends. We need the church. There is no such thing as an isolated Christian. It is biblically impossible. Once you receive Christ as Savior you are grafted into the "

It's amazing how many people fall for it every time. The hoax pops up every year or so and despite numerous warnings that it is a hoax people just cant help themselves. Basically, the hoax says that unless you post a particular legal notice on your page all of your information will be owned by Facebook. Another part of the hoax claims that unless you post a notice on your page desiring to use Facebook for free they will start charging you. None of this is true, but out of fear people still fall for it. Well I decided to have some fun and post a satirical response to this hoax I found on my page, just so folks could see how gullible they were. I don't know who wrote it but it is brilliant: Very Important Facebook Notice! Please read! Important: Facebook will begin stealing your undergarments at midnight tonight if you don't copy & paste this message in the next 37 seconds, forward it to everyone in your mailing list, print a hard copy for your grandmother & call your third grade teacher. This is real. I got the message first hand from Elvis who was having lunch with Bigfoot, while riding the Loch Ness monster. It was even on the inside back cover of every tabloid in the grocery store checkout line. Not only is the above going to happen, but Facebook will start charging you tomorrow. They are also going to bill your credit card for the past 3 years of services. Luckily, each person who copies & pastes this status will receive a FREE unicorn in the mail tomorrow. However, if you don't repost this status, Facebook code has been set up to automatically set your computer on fire & harm an innocent bunny in the forest! It's all true. It was on the news! It's official! Facebook users will believe anything their friends copy & paste into their status!:) Had to do this because I WANT a free unicorn! Well, I had a friend on Facebook who loved my post so much that she mailed me something very special. This is unicorn meat and it promises magic in every bite! The nutrition information says there is 100 percent eternal happiness in each portion! Wouldnt it be wonderful if life worked like that? It would be nice if we could just avoid trouble and problems in life by posting a notice on our Facebook page. It would be nice if a legal notice posted on our page would give us nothing but good stuff like magical unicorns. But that's not how life works. In fact, there is an old saying, You are either coming out of trouble, in the middle of trouble, or about to get into trouble. That's life. God never promises us a trouble free life. That's why I no longer ask ""Why me?"" I ask ""Why not me?"" But the Bible does promise us that we can live with confidence and strength each day, no matter what we face. We can live without fear or dread of what might be coming around the corner. We can have peace within regardless of the storms outside of us. We can laugh in the midst of trouble. Does that sound good? You see, I don't want to just end this series with your questions of why answered. I want us to end this series with you ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~Servefeeling equipped to live your life with confidence. I want you to be ready for anything that life might throw at you. I want you to live your life not motivated by fear but faith. I want you to enjoy the life God has for you and not live in dread about what tomorrow may bring. That's no way to live and that's not how God wants us to live. I imagine most of you would like to live life this way. I'm sure many of you are sick and tired of slugging through life, being defined by your pain and suffering. You don't want life to simply consist of surviving the day, waiting for the weekend, or trying to find a few moments of peace. You want life to be more than just avoiding as much trouble as you can. You want your life to be full of joy even in the most trying of circumstances. In short, you want to live on the offensive not on the defensive. You don't want to be a victim; you want to be a victor! Well, guess what? You can have that life! How? Well by learning and applying some biblical wisdom I want to share with you today. If you want to turn your trouble into triumph and your rough times into glory pay attention today and apply the biblical wisdom you are about to learn. So where do we find this wisdom? In Romans 8: Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?...No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. -Romans 8: 35, 37 ""More than Conquerors."" These are three of the most powerful words in all of the Bible. Paul uses these three words to describe how Christians respond to pain and adversity. What does it mean? Why didn't Paul just say God will give you the strength to get through it. One day you will get the better of it. You will conquer it. You will have victory over it. Paul doesn't do that. He doesn't say, ""There, there. It will all be over soon. This too shall pass."" No, Paul takes one more giant step and says that we as Christians are ""More than Conquerors"" through pain and suffering. We do more than just get through it. We do more than just overcome it. We do more than conqueror it. We do more than have victory over it. How can we more than conqueror something? Take a closer look at this phrase. Paul combines the Greek words ""hyper"" and ""nikao to create the phrase more than conquerors. Hyper means super, beyond, surpassing and nikao means victorious. So Paul is basically saying we are ""Super Victorious!"" We are victory on steroids! We are super victors. Super overcomers! In other words, we don't just win. We just don't have victory. Our trouble makes us stronger. We have stronger faith, more wisdom and greater love for Christ and others. We emerge stronger after the battle. We dont just conquer. We are more than conquerors because we are stronger by Gods grace and power. God uses the resistance of our trouble to build strength in us. Take a look at James 1:2-4: Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. -James 1:2-4 We apply this principle in strength training. What gives us stronger muscles? Resistance. Whether you are lifting weights or using a resistance band, you are using resistance to build strength. The same principle applies to our spiritual lives. There is only one thing that builds strength. Resistance! Strength does not develop without resistance. Plain and simple. We have to resist the trouble in our lives with Gods help in order to get stronger and move forward. Here is a great story that illustrates my point. Take a look at Dusty the Donkey. One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well that the farmer had accidentally left uncovered. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway, so it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off! The moral of the story is life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a steppingstone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up. The Bible calls this, Working out our salvation. In Gods eyes, our troubles are stepping stones to stronger faith and spiritual stamina. We build spiritual strength by exercising resistance to the problems, pain and pressures of life. Adversity builds in us spiritual strength to overcome the next time trouble comes. But in order to build that spiritual strength we must exercise resistance not with our own power but by the power of God who lives within us! If you never practice using Gods power in your life in the midst of trouble and adversity you will never know what you are capable of with Gods power. But when we use Gods power to withstand in the midst of adversity we come to rely more and more on Gods power within us instead of our own power. Thats when we become stronger. Thats when we become More than Conquerors  when we learning to depend on Gods power rather than our own. I cant think of a greater illustration of this than when Peter went barefoot skiing with Jesus. Well, not exactly, but here is the story: Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. Its a ghost, they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: Take courage! It is I. Dont be afraid. Lord, if its you, Peter replied, tell me to come to you on the water. Come, he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, Lord, save me! Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. You of little faith, he said, why did you doubt? And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, Truly you are the Son of God. Matthew 14:25-33 Now a popular way to interpret this text is that Peter started to sink when he took his eyes off Jesus. Thats not bad but I think it goes a bit deeper than that. Peter came to the place where he realized that he was powerless over the elements of the storm and he was powerless over gravity. He came to a moment of truth where he knew all he had was Jesus. So here is the message I want you to receive today: We never know that Jesus is enough until Jesus is all we have left. Once we come to realize this we can begin our transformation into more than conquerors. Paul learned the same lesson as Peter. Look at how he describes it: I have learned to be content, whatever the circumstances may be. I know now how to live when things are difficult and I know how to live when things are prosperous. In general and in particular I have learned the secret of facing either poverty or plenty. I am ready for anything through the strength of the one who lives within me.Philippians 4:11-13 Paul didnt say the secret was a different set of circumstances. He didnt say the secret was will power. He said the secret was Christ in him! Christ enabled him to be ready for anything and made him stronger through the trouble he faced. Jesus is all Paul had and he learned that Jesus was enough. When you face trouble with the confidence that the spirit of Christ will enable you to overcome it and redeem it you, you wont waste your time and energy relying on anything or anyone else. You know the source to draw strength from. You can be ready for anything. You know you have the strength to face anything and you know you will be stronger whenever you conquer your battles in life. You see, when trouble in life gets the best of us it is usually because we dont believe Jesus is enough. So we try to find peace and strength in other things and they never work. They simply make us vulnerable to the circumstances we face and our problems overwhelm us. Fear develops when we start believing that everything depends on us. Faith and strength develop when we learn that everything depends on God. We never know that Jesus is enough until Jesus is all we have left. Amen. "
Sept-13-2015-sermon,"to good people is to offer another question: What happens to good people when bad things happen to them? This is a question that the Bible clearly answers. In the eighth chapter of Romans, Paul uses several words to describe the assumed pain and suffering of life: hardship, persecution, distress, nakedness, peril, the sword. Paul and the early Christians were very much in touch with unfair suffering. But what did Paul say happens to us when we experience bad things? Not only did he say that we will never be separated from Gods love, but in Romans 8:28 Paul says something truly remarkable: All things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose. This remarkable verse expresses that evil and pain is never the will of God, but God can take evil and pain and use it for good. Over and over again in life we see this. When evil attacks with pain, God uses it to build character. When evil shows resistance, God uses it to build strength. When evil cripples with tragedy, God finds a way to victory. When evil destroys with death, God restores life. God is in the transformation business. God can turn our trouble into triumph! The ultimate example of this is Jesus work on the cross. Before Jesus, the cross represented suffering, shame, punishment, and death. But he came and transformed it into a symbol of victory, forgiveness, love and life. So whenever we gaze upon the cross we are reminded that God can take what is ugly and make it beautiful. My friend Andrews funeral that I mentioned earlier was an ugly experience but God did do something beautiful with it. The night before the funeral I was talking with one of Andrews childhood friends. We were sitting on a dock looking out at a lake. He confessed that he was not very religious. He asked, So, youre a minister huh? I said, Yes I am. He asked, How do you deal with death and funerals? How do you get through them? Thats got to be tough? I said, Yeah, it is. But God gives me the strength to be able to minister in those situations. It is never easy but God helps me. He replied, You really believe all that stuff? I said, I sure do. With all my heart. The next day at the funeral I read some scripture and said a few words about Andrew. After the funeral Andrews friend approached me and said, This faith stuff is real to you, isnt it? I said, It sure is. Then he said, Ive never read the Bible very much. Could you recommend a translation I should read? I said, Here, take mine. Its yours. Now, it was my favorite Bible, but I thought it was for a good cause! God took a very ugly situation and did something beautiful with it. He provided an opportunity for me to share with someone that my strength comes from God. And the message I want to leave you with today is that God take what is ugly in your life and make it beautiful. If your patient enough and open to what God wants to do in your life, He will take what is ugly and make it beautiful. Give to God what is ugly in your life. Just hand it over to Him. And He will do something beautiful with it. Amen. Pasadena Community Church WHY? ~ WHY is There Suffering in the World? Sunday, September 13, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Why? We all wrestle with this question at some point in our lives. When bad things happen, our prayers seem unanswered, and God seems far away, we cry out, Why? In this series of messages, we will look to the scriptures and the stories of those who have come through horrific tragedies to help us understand how God is at work in our lives and our world. Today I begin this series with most challenging question of all. I am sure it has been on many of our minds this past week as we remember the horrific tragedy of 9/11: If there is a God then why do people suffer? Another way people ask this question is, Why do bad things happen to good people? In theological circles it is called the theodicy question. Basically the underlying angst for many who ask the theodicy question is this: If God cant stop suffering, then he is not great. If God can stop suffering and doesnt, then he is not good. So many folks ask, If you are telling me God is great and good, then why is there suffering in the world? It is a great question. It is my experience that the theodicy question is one of the biggest reasons why so many people choose not to believe in God. For many, this question is a huge roadblock to faith. In fact, you may be one of those people. Maybe you have experienced unspeakable pain and tragedy in your life and the suffering you have been through keeps you from believing that God exists, let alone a good, loving God. Youre here to see if someone can really tell you why bad things happen to good people. Or perhaps those of you here who believe in God, which is most of us, have friends and relatives who have experienced great suffering and the theodicy question has kept them from faith in God. You dont know how to help them. Or maybe you believe in God but the theodicy question has lingered within you for a long time. What I am about to share I believe will help everyone who struggles with this challenging question. Wrong Answer! Let me begin by saying that one of the biggest problems with this question is how some Christians have answered it. How some Christians have answered this question has not only been unhelpful but harmful. In past sermons I have shared with you that when I was in seminary one of my best friends in college was killed by a drunk driver. He and his girlfriend were on bikes in Austin, Texas on their way to the hill country for the afternoon. In my friends pocket was an engagement ring. He was going to propose marriage to her that day. That proposal never happened. A drunk driver struck both of them, killing my friend instantly. His girlfriend suffered multiple injuries and was in a coma for two months. I was invited by my friends family to read scripture and speak at the funeral. I remember going to the viewing the day before the funeral. It was an open casket. I recall looking at my friend in the casket and someone standing next to me saying something I will never forget. I dont know who the person was, but he looked at my friend in the casket and said, It is hard to understand Gods will sometimes. Now, I was ready to give that man a good sermon, but it wasnt the time or place. I thought to myself, God didnt do this! A drunk driver did! It is amazing how some Christians will blame suffering on God. A baby dies and someone says, God needed another angel in heaven. A young mother dies of breast cancer leaving a ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org husband and two kids behind and someone says, God works in mysterious ways. A group of teenagers on their way to prom are killed in a car accident and someone says, God must have had a purpose. We get bad news. We are disappointed. Life takes a bad turn and we have a well meaning friend say to us, Everything happens for a reason. She received news from the doctor that she has cancer and her friend says, God never gives you more than you can handle. What? Of course it doesnt help the cause of the Christian faith that we have particular Christian personalities say dreadful things on television. Some of you will remember that after 9/11 a well known religious figure went on TV and told the world that God orchestrated 9/11 to punish America for its sins. He said abortionists, feminists, gays and lesbians had angered God and 9/11 was the way God chose to punish us. And then we wonder why some folks are turned off by Christians and the church? And then we wonder why some folks dont want to have anything to do with God? Why would they when they hear Christians say that God causes great suffering and pain in the world? Why would they want to believe in a God like that? It is beyond me how some folks who read the same Bible I do and follow the same Christ that I follow can believe that God would orchestrate unspeakable tragedy. It is beyond me how some folks who believe that the same God who personified himself in Christ and put little children on his knee would kill children with cancer, kill teenagers through car accidents, and wipe out families in tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes. It is beyond me. The God I know and love would not plot and plan suffering and tragedy. Sometimes bad things happen because of the foolishness of others. Sometimes bad things happen because of our own bad choices. Sometimes bad things happen because we live in an evil and imperfect world. But lets not blame tragedy and suffering on God. So, if you are someone who has always wondered I will tell you this: God does not cause suffering. Why Is There Suffering? Well, this begs the question, Then why is there suffering? If God is great and good, then why is there suffering in the world? It may come as surprise to some of you that the theodicy question can be seen throughout the Bible. The Psalms ask it. Job asks it. Lamentations is full of it. The prophet Habakkuk complains to God about it. The prophet Jeremiah questions God about it: Why do the wicked prosper and the innocent suffer? Look at what Jeremiah says to God in the 12th chapter: Righteous are you, O LORD, when I complain to you; yet I would plead my case before you. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all who are treacherous thrive? Many of the biblical writers cry out with this same burning question that we ask today. So what is the answer to Jeremiahs complaint, to our complaint? In a word, freedom. We live a world where God has given us freedom. The same freedom that allows us to choose to love and serve God allows others to pick up weapons and kill innocent people. Freedom itself is good, like all of Gods gifts, but some choose to pervert Gods gift and use it for evil. So why doesnt God intervene before a gunman shoots innocent people? Why doesnt God do something to prevent people from killing each other? Because freedom is at stake. If God took away our freedom to do evil He would also be taking away our freedom to do good! And if God did that we would just be a bunch of numb robots incapable of love or hate. God doesnt want us to be like that anymore than you want to be like that (Fear Itself by Jim Somerville). What about those tragic events that human beings dont cause like natural disasters? Well, not only is humanity broken but creation itself is broken too. The truth is that we live in a sinful world that runs amok and bad things happen to both the innocent and the guilty. Sin permeates biology, humanity, and geography and everyone, good and bad, experiences the consequences of it. As Christians we have the assurance that one day Christ will come in glory and all of our questions will be answered, all of the great mysteries will be solved, all of our confusion will turn into clarity, and every tear will be wiped away. Of course, until that great day comes we have to cope with suffering in life. So the questions is: If God does not cause tragedy and suffering, what role does God play in suffering? Where is God when it hurts? Where is God when planes crash and earthquakes come and people die in car accidents? Where is God and is He involved at all? You may be suffering today and want to know the answer to that question. How do we make sense of suffering if we follow a loving and powerful God? I want to offer some things that have helped me as I have struggled with the question of why bad things happen to good people. My prayer is that they will help you too. We Never Suffer Alone I want to lift up a passage of scripture that tells us exactly where God is when we suffer. It comes from the Old Testament, from the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah was prophesying about Jesus and he said something that I think all of us need to remember when it comes to our own suffering. In fact, what I am about to read may bring healing to you today. Isaiah 53:3-4 reads: He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows. Did you see that? He carried our sorrows. He carries our sorrows. I want you to hear that today. Wherever you are, whatever you are going through, whatever pain you are in God carries your sorrows. He shares it with you. He cries with you. He aches with you. He loves you too much for you to deal with it alone. You see, Jesus death tells us that when we suffer, God suffers with us. The cross and resurrection reveal that God suffers when we suffer and He has the power to redeem our suffering. Look for the Helpers Mister Rogers said it so well: ""When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping. Harry Emerson Fosdick once said, Goodness is a far greater problem for the atheist than evil is for the believer. Instead of focusing on the evil and suffering in the world, look at all the goodness that abounds! Where does all this goodness come from? It can only come from a loving God who cares for us. Allow the goodness in the world to lead you back to the goodness of God. And may the goodness of God lead you to help heal the suffering in the world. Because God wants to heal suffering in this world, and you know how He is going to do it? Through you and through me! When God wants something done in this world, he counts on his church to do it! You want to see God at work in the midst of suffering, just open your eyes. He works through people all the time. And he wants to work through you! Recently, Sherriffs Deputy Darren Goforth was gunned down at a gas pump in Harris County. Texas. And, of course, the deputies in Harris County cant help but feel anxious. And we cant help but wonder whats wrong with this world. But lets follow Mister Rogers advice and look for the helpers. I want to show you a picture. This is Tommi Jones Kelly and she is a law enforcement officer in Harris, County, Texas. She posted this selfie with a teenager who asked if he could stand watch over her while she pumped gas in the pouring rain. Here is what happened in Officer Kellys own words: Ok, so early this morning I was pumping gas in my patrol car (reason I look like a hot mess!)and add it was pouring rainWhen this teenager Ive never met before is standing right behind me and says, maam, do you mind if I stand here behind you while you get your gas? My initial response was and why? His reply, to make sure you stay safe! I finished pumping my gas and he was still standing there, in the rain. Then he just walked off and started to get into the passenger side of a car. I asked the driver if she was his Mom & indeed she was. I told her she has an amazing son. The mother said, He wanted to make sure no one hurt you. Yes, Im the one with the gun on my hip while he stood there empty handed, but he for sure had my back while it was turned. With all the terror going on nationwide, this reassured me there are still some pretty awesome individuals out there! The teenagers name is Mckinley Zoellnerner. He said, It was amazing to see her face. Afterwards she gave me a big hug. And Zoellnerner said he had never been hugged by a cop before! Of course, before they left the gas station they snapped this selfie and the picture has gone viral on the internet. Kelly said, I hope people understand that we will risk our lives for them. What if Christians just did their job? A lot of suffering in this world would be alleviated. What is our job as Christians? To help God alleviate suffering in the world. So often we complain to God and wonder why He is not doing something about the suffering in the world and Im sure His reply is, I am trying to do something, through YOU! You are my hands and feet in this world! Look for the helpers and be a helper. What Happens to Good People When Bad Things Happen to Them? I believe the best help I can give as we grapple with the question of why bad things happen "
Sept-20-2015-sermon,"scripture. Read the devotional or scripture passage. When you find that you are quiet on the inside, pray, Lord, I want to get to know you better. I want to know your love. I want a relationship with you Then share with God what is on your mind and heart. Dont hold back. Just share it. He is listening and wants to hear from you. Be sure to include not only your own needs but the needs of others. Before you end your prayer time, pray, Lord, I want to please you. I want to do your will. Whatever it is you want, thats what I want too. I want to fit into your plans. Show me the way. Jesus knew the power of submitting to Gods will. Perhaps Jesus most important prayer was the one he prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane. His capture and crucifixion were close at hand. He was emotionally and spiritually exhausted. He was tempted not to go through with Gods plan. He pleaded with God to let the cup pass from him. It was at that moment that he said the prayer that changed everything -Lord, not my will but yours be done. This was not Jesus first prayer to God. He had been praying his whole life and ministry. He had developed such love and trust for God that when it came to the moment of truth he was prepared to surrender to Gods will. As a result, the world was changed. It is my assertion that what enabled Jesus to do what God had sent him to do for the world was his prayer life. I remember playing with the pew pencils in church when I was a kid. The pencils always had these words inscribed on them: Prayer Changes Things. As I have grown in my faith, I have learned that prayer does indeed change things, but it is not God who changes. It is me. There is a wonderful old phrase: Prayer does not give us what we want, but prayer helps us want what we need. How true that is. You see, prayer is not designed to change or persuade God; it is designed by God to change us! Prayer is a spiritual discipline through which we are formed into disciples of Jesus Christ. Just imagine how close you could feel to God if you prayed more. Just imagine what God could show you if you prayed more. Just imagine what God could do through you if you prayed more. Imagine the strength and wisdom you could have if you prayed more. Imagine the opportunities from God that would open for you if you prayed more. Imagine the person you could become if you prayed more. Imagine the relationships that could be healed if you prayed more. Imagine the impact our church would have if every one of us developed the habit of prayer. Just imagine the difference it would make to our ministries and our outreach into the community. Imagine the lives we could touch for Christ if all of us prayed more often. Imagine what God could do through our church through the power of prayer. Amen. ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org Pasadena Community Church WHY? ~ WHY Do My Prayers Go Unanswered? Luke 11: 5 -13 Sunday, September 20, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor Today I continue our series Why? When life gets difficult and we all ask why? Why God? Why me? Why this? Why now? In this series we are exploring what the Bible has to say in response Why? This morning I want to focus one of the most common questions I receive: Why are my prayers going unanswered? If we are honest, most of us have been there. Deep inside many of us want to know if prayer makes a difference. And if it does make a difference, what difference does it make? Does prayer really work? If it does work, how does it work? Those of us who are Christians know that prayer is something we ought to do. If we need something  if we are confused about something  if we need guidance or direction  we have been taught to pray about it. In fact, most of us have heard well meaning friends ask us, Have you prayed about it? You know that prayer is important, but maybe you struggle with prayer because you never seem to get the results you are looking for. You know you need to take time to talk with God but it just doesnt seem to get you anywhere. You know you need to pray but you just dont seem to get an answer. And maybe this frustrates you because you hear people talking all the time about the power of prayer like God is eating their cornflakes with them at the breakfast table every morning and when you pray it feels like you are ringing the door bell to an empty house! Maybe you are someone who has a heavy burden or a serious issue in your life and you have prayed and prayed about it and you wonder if all your prayers are falling on deaf ears. Maybe you have prayed for a troubled child, a sick relative, a job, a better marriage, or some other serious issue and you dont seem to be getting the answer you need. You wonder, Is God listening? And maybe you feel you are not doing it right and you think if you buy the latest book on prayer or attend a conference you can find the right prayer technique that will Open Sesame! Perhaps you find the act of praying difficult because you get easily distracted and bored. Okay God, here I am, I have this need and.Is God really listening or am I just talking to myself.I do need to get to the grocery storeThere is that email I need to return.Well, I can always pray later. After all, this is God. He knows me. He knows my thoughts before I think them. Why do I have to pray when he knows what I am going to say? I can be doing something more productive with my time Can you relate? Some of you here today may be skeptical about prayer. Maybe you think it is just wishful thinking or whistling in the dark. You think the whole idea of the Creator of the world listening to one prayer among billions is ridiculous. Really? God has to listen to so many prayers! How does that work? Does prayer make any difference or are we just wasting our breath? Does prayer matter or are there better things we can do with our time? Well, so much of our frustration with prayer has to do with a lack of understanding of what prayer is. Is it religious magic? Is it giving a cosmic Santa Claus a list? Is it putting our order into the universe? Is it crossing our fingers Christian style? What is prayer really? Until we understand what prayer is we will never understand the huge difference it can make in our lives. What I want to do today is help us understand what prayer is and how to do it. Prayer is the single most important act for anyone who seeks to follow God. We cant know the will of God for our lives unless we pray. We cannot be strong in the face of temptation unless we pray. We cant be the people God wants us to be unless we pray. We cannot be healthy spiritually unless we pray. We cannot make lasting changes in our lives unless we pray. We cant get faith right until we get prayer right. Jesus knew this. Jesus understood the importance of prayer and the difference it makes. Jesus prayed all the time. In fact, in the gospel of Luke we find 15 different references to Jesus praying! At every turn in his life and ministry Jesus was praying. He prayed as he began his ministry. He prayed to renew himself. He prayed before he chose his disciples. He prayed as he evaluated his ministry. He prayed as he served and healed people. He prayed as he faced his crucifixion. He prayed on the cross. He prayed after he was resurrected. Jesus was always praying. It wasnt an option for Jesus. He knew that in order for him to accomplish what God wanted him to do he needed to pray. If Jesus thought it was that important to pray, dont you think we should be praying? In our scripture lesson for today we notice the disciples picking up on Jesus habit of praying. They see him praying all the time and think that they ought to learn something from it. So today we see Jesus praying in a certain place and the disciples approach him and say, Uh, Jesus, that prayer thing you are always doing? Can you teach us to do it too? Jesus agrees and begins to teach them. First he gives them a powerful prayer to learn  The Lords Prayer. After that he teaches them about the importance of prayer. Please understand  this teaching is not from the latest prayer guru who has written a best-selling book. This is a lesson on prayer from the Master himself: And he said to them, Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves of bread; for a friend of mine has arrived, and I have nothing to set before him. And he answers from within, Do not bother me; the door has already been locked, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything. I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs. -Luke 11:5-8 Circle the word persistence. That is the key word of this little parable. Jesus is not saying that God is bothered by our prayers or that God wants us to work a little when we pray. What Jesus is saying through this parable is that the key to effective prayer is persistent, habitual prayer. Big shocker! Are we surprised? If I go to the gym once a month, do you think it will do me any good? If I follow my diet once a week, do you think it will do me any good? Prayer works the same way. For prayer to make a difference it must become a habit. Many of us forget this simple truth. We pray for something once and we are disappointed when nothing changes. Perhaps we think, Well, doesnt God hear me the first time? Yes, God hears us the first time, but prayer is deeper than that. Lets keep reading. So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who asks receives, and everyone who searches finds, and for everyone who knocks, the door will be opened. -Luke 11:9-10 Wow! Did you read what I just read? You know what this means? This means that God always answers our prayers. Whenever we ask, God will answer. Whenever we search, we will find. Whenever we knock, God will open the door. And Jesus says this is true for EVERYONE. Everyone who seeks God persistently in prayer will receive an answer. This is a spiritual law. God answers prayer. The power of God through prayer is available to everyone. But notice what Jesus does not say. Jesus does not say everyone who asks receives the answer they want or finds what they are looking for or has the door they want open opened. God always answers us, but we may not always like the answer or expect the answer we get. What we want from God and what we receive from God are two different things. God loves us too much to always give us what we want because sometimes what we want is not good for us or what is best for us. But God will always answer us. Perhaps this changes your wondering about unanswered prayer. Maybe God has answered you and you just dont like the answer. Someone once said that God answers prayer in one of four ways: yes, no, wait, and are you kidding? Bill Hybels says it quite well: If the request is wrong, God says, ""No."" If the timing is wrong, God says, ""Slow."" If you are wrong, God says, ""Grow."" But if the request is right, the timing is right and you are right, God says, ""Go!"" This is somewhat glib, but there is some truth to it. I recall times in my own life when I prayed and prayed for God to give me something, and my prayers were never answered, or so I thought. Later, I discovered that what I wanted was not right for me. That event always reminds me of the country song, Thank God for Unanswered Prayer. There have been other times when God seemed to know that I was not ready for the answer to my prayer or the timing was not right, and God asked me to wait. It was then that I relied on the words of the Psalmist: Wait for the Lord! Jesus clearly states that there is something we can always count on to receive from God when we pray. Listen closely. Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for a fish, will give a snake instead of a fish? Or if the child asks for an egg, will give a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him! Luke 11:11-13 This is the single most important text about prayer. Jesus says that whenever we seek God in prayer God will always give to us His Spirit (the Holy Spirit). What is the purpose of the Holy Spirit? To love us, mold us, shape us, guide us, empower us, and direct us. This means that prayer is not putting our order in to God. It is not rubbing a magic lamp or giving a Santa Claus in the sky our list. Prayer is not getting our phrasing right so we can unlock the God machine. Prayer is the one essential practice that brings us closer to God and allows us to be formed by His love. Prayer is not getting from God; Prayer is intimacy with God. Prayer is developing a relationship with God. Thats why it must be a habit. So here is the message I want you receive today: Prayer is not meant to persuade God; it is meant to change us. Prayer is not bending Gods will to our will; it is bending our will to Gods will. Prayer does not give us what we want from God; prayer helps us want what we need from God. And what we need is to get our hearts right. What we need is to get our souls right. What we need is to get our relationships right. And this can only happen through a relationship with God in prayer. The truth is most of the time we dont want a relationship; we want a roadmap. We pray, Okay God, I dont need much of your time. You dont need to get too involved. Just give me some direction here. What should I do? God replies, Just hang out with me for awhile. Lets spend some time together. I want to show you some things. We persist, Lord, really. I dont need that much of you. Just give me a yes or no. God replies, Just abide in me and my love from day to day and you will find what you are looking for. God still wants us to bring Him our needs, and our desires, and our questions and doubts. God loves us and wants us to give Him all that we are. But the answer to our questions, needs, and desires comes as we develop an intimate relationship with God through prayer. When we develop intimacy with God through prayer we find that abiding in His love and being the people He wants us to be is where true life is found. The more we experience true life the more we want to please God. And the more we want to please God the easier it is for us to change. And the easier it is for us to change the quicker we are to pray, Lord, I want to fit into your plans. You want God to move like a tidal wave in your life? You want prayer to make a huge impact in your life? Be prepared to pray, Lord, whatever you want, thats what I want too! When you are ready to surrender like that in prayer, life gets exciting and becomes more interesting that you would ever imagine. You see, we must move from Lord, this is how I want things to work in my life to Lord, I want what you want for my life. If you desire intimacy with God through prayer today, I have a simple suggestion for you. If you do what I am about to tell you, you will experience the difference that prayer can make in your life. For the next seven days start your day with prayer. It doesnt have to be a long time -5 to 10 minutes. You can stay in your bed or sit in a chair or do it at the breakfast table. Get a devotional or turn to your favorite passage of "
Sept-27-2015-sermon,"direction from God in a special circumstance? Sure and I believe God can and will provide it and when he does it will be very evident if we are connected to him. But folks, most of the time, Gods will for us can be found by answering these two questions: Will this honor God and what is the loving thing to do? And, you may say, Well, there are many options with those questions. Thats right! You see, so often we think Gods will is confined to one thing. The truth is Gods will is often all of the above. Gods will for us is to love him and love others and that means Gods will can be fulfilled in a myriad of ways. Most of the time Gods will is not a pin point but a big expanding circle. We have a big God. Why would his will be so confined? Now are there limits? Yes, there are lines and boundaries that God does not want us to cross and he will let us know what they are. But God gives us the freedom to live out his will in a variety of ways. C. S. Lewis once said that all genuine religious conversions are blessed defeats. You want to know the secret to finding Gods will? A surrendered spirit. This means we must change how we approach God and his will for us. Instead of deciding what we want to do and asking God to bless it, we must decide to surrender all we are to God and ask him what he wants to do with us. We must put ourselves at the disposal of God. Lord I want to honor you and love others. Then and only then, will we be clear about our Lords will for our lives and we will see there are many ways to we can live out Gods will in the world. I knew a lady in another church I served who learned the power of a surrendered spirit. She was caught stealing and sentenced to prison. After serving time in prison, she sold everything she had, except for a few necessities, and gave it all away to the poor. Then she moved to the mountains and, as time passed, she became an excellent painter. When she reflected on her transformation she said, When you have been caught, you have nothing to hide. And when you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. And when you have nothing to fear, oh my, what you can become. Imagine what you could become with a surrendered spirit to God. Imagine what this church could become with a surrendered spirit. Amen. Pasadena Community Church WHY? ~ WHY is Gods Will So Elusive? Sunday, September 27, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor PASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org Why? We all wrestle with this question at some point in our lives. When bad things happen, our prayers seem unanswered, and God seems far away, we cry out, Why? Today we focus on this common question: Why is Gods Will So Elusive? Ever struggled with finding Gods will in your life? Take a look at this picture. Wouldnt it be nice if God really spoke to us this way? Wouldnt it be nice if we were ever confused about something, all we would have to do is look at a billboard and find the answer or look up into the sky and there would be something written in the clouds. Or what about the radio? That would be great! We could just tune in to a particular station each week and Gods voice would break in and say, This is what I want you to do. A lot of us would love to hear from God in such a clear way. Then again, depending upon the message and the state of our lives, some of us would not! Overall, though, most people I speak with yearn to hear Gods voice and want to know Gods will for their lives. Gods will is one of the biggest issues I deal with as a pastor. People continually come to me, desperately wanting to know Gods will. They often say, I have a big decision, and I need to know what God wants me to do! I am at a crossroad, and I wonder what Gods will is for my life? When I ask people what they would like to hear a sermon on, a frequent response is, Finding Gods will for my life. Obviously, finding Gods will is important for many of us. Gods will is not a secret. Discovering Gods will is not some kind of existential game of hide and seek where God hides it and is amused by watching us try to find it. God deeply desires for us to know and do his will. Unfortunately, many have the notion that discovering Gods will is reserved only for the spiritually elite. They hear friends speak about God as if he was at their breakfast table every morning, and then they wonder why they cant hear God too. But being in tune with Gods will for us is not complicated. We just make it complicated. So in todays message I am going to tell you how simple it is to find Gods will and apply it. But before we go any further it is important that we have the right understanding of Gods will. Many people have a false picture of God and how God views human beings. Instead of seeing God as loving and merciful, many see God as an angry, gray haired old man with a stick, waiting to find those who are breaking the rules so he can punish them. Nothing could be further from truth! Read what the Bible says about God: 2 Corinthians 1:3 states that God is the Father of all mercies, and the God of all comfort. In John 10:11 were a told that God in Christ is the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for his sheep. 1 John 3:1 proclaims that God is the Sovereign God who loves us so much that he calls us his children. James 1:17 says that God is the Father who gives only good gifts. The Bible is clear that we have a loving and merciful God. However, the most convincing evidence for the good nature and will of God is Gods revelation to us in Jesus Christ. God chose to reveal himself in Jesus Christ so we could understand what his ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~Servenature is like. Through Christ, God communicated to us that he forgives us, loves us, and wants what is best for ushe went all the way to cross to prove that to us! Romans 12:1-2 is clear about Gods intentions for us: I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of God -what is good and acceptable and perfect. What God has in mind for us comes in three words in verse 2: Good, acceptable, and perfect. Gods will is good, acceptable, and perfect. First, Gods will is good. This means that God has the highest and best for us in mind. Second, Gods will is acceptable. The Greek word for acceptable means well pleasing and agreeable.Third, Gods will is perfect, which means it meets the needs of the person. We can be sure that no matter what circumstance we face, we can have the peace that comes from knowing that Gods will for us in any situation is good, acceptable, and perfect. God knows us better than we know ourselves and he wants what is best for us. By now you may be asking, Well, if God want us to know his will, and it is good for us, why is it so difficult to discover? The answer: We have a will, too! You see, often people know what Gods will is for them; they just dont want to do it. They hide behind the statement, Woe is me, I cant find Gods will. In reality it is more like, Woe is me, I dont want to do what God wants me to do. I have discovered as a pastor that more often than not when people struggle with Gods will in their lives, it is a struggle of change or a struggle of pride. This is not always the case, but in most cases, somewhere in our struggles to find Gods will is either the obstacle of change or the obstacle of pride. There are those who fear change so much that they have a spiritual block to hearing and doing Gods will. For some feel like the poem by A. A. Milne, the creator of Winnie the Pooh: When I was One, I had just begun. When I was two, I was nearly new. When I was three, I was hardly me. When I was four, I was not much more. When I was five, I was just alive. But now I am six, Im as clever as ever. So I think Ill be six forever and ever! We are creatures of habit and we get comfortable very easily. Therefore, we dont like change. Sometimes this can be the real cause of our inability to finds Gods will. God could be giving us signs and expressions everyday but because we fear change our spirit is not open to recognizing those signs. Lord, let me know your will, but make sure it doesnt involve change. Good luck with that one! The unavoidable truth is that there is no growth, Christian or otherwise, there is no wholeness, there is no fulfillment, there is nothing worthwhile that happens in this gift of God called life without change. To refuse to change is to refuse the best God has to offer you and your life. Period. Pride can also be an obstacle for many who are struggling to find Gods will. When out of control, pride can strip our spiritual gears and put us in a real mess. Pride is what started it all in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve thought, We dont need God; we can be gods ourselves. And we all know the pain and misery that followed. Too much pride can get us into a lot of trouble. I saw this illustrated right before my eyes a few years ago. I was coming out of the church office, and I watched as a toddler got away from her mother and began to run toward a busy street. The mother was pregnant and had an infant in her arms. I immediately drop the books that were in my hands and ran after the child. I will never forget the look on the childs face. She looked back at me laughing, determined to outrun me, not knowing she was headed for great danger. Fortunately, I was able to catch her before she ran into the busy street. Pride is like that. We get so filled with it that we are totally oblivious to where it is leading us. This is why it is impossible to live out Gods will when we are filled with pride, for pride makes us stubborn to Gods will, or it selfishly attaches conditions to Gods will. It is almost comical. Our pride often causes us to bargain with God: Yes, Lord I will forgive this person as long as he apologizes. Or, Yes, Lord, I will serve in the church as long as I get recognized for my efforts. Is it any wonder that we have a tough time finding Gods will and living it out when we live our faith in this way? So are you struggling to find Gods will for you? Ask yourself: Do I have and issue with change or pride? You may find the culprit. However, that may not help you. Perhaps you have prayerfully searched yourself and you know that your struggle with Gods will is not a struggle of change or pride and you are at a loss. The truth is sometimes when we struggle with knowing Gods will we just have to go back to fundamentals. Ever hear a reporter interview an athlete who has just come out of a slump? Quite often you will hear the athlete tell the report, I just needed to get back to fundamentals. Sometimes when we struggle in our faith journey and have a difficult time discerning Gods will for us, we need to do the same thing  Get back to the fundamentals of our faith. And what are the fundamentals of our faith? Well, Jesus gave them to us. Jesus had a knack for getting to the heart of the matter: When the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together, and one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest? Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. Matthew 22 Jesus answer was revolutionary. He quoted from Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18. He said if someone follows these two commands he or she will keep the essence of the Law. Jesus was saying, You want the Cliff Notes version of the living out the faith? You want me to sum it up for you? You dont have to memorize all these little rules and laws and worry yourself sick. All you have to do is do two things and you got it. Here it is: Love God with all your being and love other people like you would love yourself. You do that you got the Law down! You can see the Pharisees jaws drop. They had dedicated their lives to poring over 613 laws. They interpreted them and debating them. And along comes this carpenter from Nazareth and he wraps them all up in one sentence! The Pharisees were so preoccupied with the details of the law that they failed to see the heart of the law. Jesus was a master at bringing out the heart of the matter. His answer shows us that the purpose of the law is to bring us closer to God and our neighbor. If we love God and our neighbor we are fulfilling what God desires. Thats it! That is the heart to all of it. This is Gods will. So how do we use this fundamental in our daily lives to discern Gods will? How do we discover Gods will as we go to work and school, deal with deadlines and kids and bills and in laws and annoying neighbors? Well, it is pretty simple. Before you speak at a pivotal moment  before you make a decision  before you choose a path  before you respond in the heat of the moment  before you make a business transaction ask yourself, Will this honor God? What is the loving thing to do? 95 percent of the time you will be confident about your decisions and actions if you ask these two questions. One of the things I do is ask myself these questions before I begin my day. During my quiet time with God in the morning I ask myself, How will I honor God today? How will my words and actions be a reflection of love to those around me? Let me tell you those questions have gotten me out of more trouble than you can imagine! But the days I am rushed and I skip that quiet time and dont ask myself those questions, my day is off balanced. I dont have the clarity I need. It is not as if God is not with me. It is that my heart has not been prepared for the day. And when your heart and my heart are not prepared every day to honor God and love others, then our days can become a trip without a compass. Folks, the truth is, many people make the idea of Gods will too complicated. When you read the Bible you find that God makes his specific will known to particular people on exceptional occasions. In other words, doing what God wants us to do is not complicated. Its pretty clear. Follow the greatest commandment, be kind to others, follow the golden rule, do not sin. Gods will is pretty straight forward. Now, are there certain times in our lives when we need a specific "
Sept-6-2015-sermon,"Pasadena Community Church Lessons from My Teachers Sunday, September 6, 2015 Sermon by: Dr. Charley Reeb, Senior Pastor of the largest Baptist churches in the south for many years. He was a prominent leader in the Atlanta community and a highly regarded spiritual leader in his denomination. In fact, Mercer School of Theology named a preacher lectureship in his name. I remember when I was a kid I would sit next to my mom and ask her why the man speaking was taking so long! Most of the time I was hungry and ready to eat lunch. Of course, growing up I thought the hymn I Surrender All had 17 verses. One more verse, come on down. I would think, Would someone just go down the aisle already! Im hungry! God has a sense of humor, doesnt he? Look at me now. Here I am preaching and some of you are thinking, When is he going to finish his sermon so we can go to lunch? When I felt a call to preach I reconnected with Bill. And that reconnection began a profound friendship with a wise man and mentor. I will never forget a letter he wrote me shortly after I started serving my first church. It transformed my preaching. He had been listening to some of my recorded sermons and his letter said the following: Charley, stop preaching to your professors! Your professors are not the ones in worship. Of course you need to preach with your head but you also need to preach with your heart. Preaching is truth through personality and I dont hear your personality in your sermons. I know your personality and there is not much of it in your preaching.start preaching to the real needs of people and preach with conviction. Preach with passion. Let your enthusiasm come out. Thats when the spirit will begin to move in your church and impact lives. Bill literally en-couraged me. He gave me the courage to preach the gospel with enthusiasm and conviction. He also reminded me that a sermon is not a lecture; it is a relevant gospel message for real people in the real world with real needs. Bills lesson to me reminds of this text found in Ephesians: Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. Ephesians 6:19 Bill continues to be a great friend and mentor. In fact, he is a father figure to me. I ask for your prayers. He was recently diagnosed with ALS and is not doing well. His faith is strong and he still has a great sense of humor, but please pray for him. So those are five great teachers in my life. I learned how to read, never give, have discipline, recognize my calling as a preacher and preach with conviction all because of these five wonderful teachers. I am sure you have your own list of great teachers and the lessons they taught you. I encourage you to locate one of them or all of them and call them or write them a note and thank them for the difference they have made in your life. I also encourage you to look for opportunities to be a teacher or mentor to someone else. All of us are teachers on some level and there are people all around us who need someone to look up to, learn from, and lean on. You never know what a difference it will make. Of course, today we celebrate the greatest teacher in history, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. The great thing about Jesus is that he has promised to be our guide and teacher wherever we go. He lives inside of us and never leaves us. He said so: I am the way, the truth and the life; I am with you always even to the end of the age. If you havent given your heart to Jesus, do so right now. You will have the greatest teacher in history guiding your life. Simply pray, Lord, I need your forgiveness, guidance and wisdom. I give my heart to you and ask you to teach me the way I should go. Amen. ExperienceLoveinAction!Connect~Grow~ServePASADENA COMMUNITY CHURCH a United Methodist Congregation 227 -70th Street South ~ St Petersburg, FL 33707 (727) 381-2499 email: pasadena@pccumc.org www.pasadenacommunitychurch.org I think I know why the Labor Day holiday falls right after school starts. It gives folks time to adjust to a new busy schedule! I read somewhere that the average person spends 14,000 hours at school by the time they reach the age of 18. Thats a lot of time with teachers! So, next to parents, teachers have the biggest impact on us. How many of you are teachers? Raise your hand if you are or have been a teacher. God bless you! Thank you for everything you do. You are the real heroes in our culture. I know all of us have our favorite teachers. Perhaps you are thinking of them right now. What made them so special? What made them your favorite? I found a quote that I believe expresses the one common characteristic of our favorite teachers: The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires. -William Arthur Ward So today I feel inspired to share lessons I have learned from some of my most inspiring teachers. I have been blessed with many wonderful teachers over the years and I would love to spend time talking about each one and the impact they have had on my life. But I doubt any of you would sit here for three hours listening to me. Therefore, I have picked just a few whose wisdom has shaped me and whose lessons continue to help me. I believe these lessons will also help you. Mrs. Jones  If you can read this, thank a teacher!One of my favorite bumper stickers is this one: If you can read this, thank a teacher! That bumper sticker always reminds me of my first grade teacher, Mrs. Jones, because she taught me how to read. I would sit at her desk everyday and sound out the words as she encouraged me. One day it just clicked and I could read. I could read just about anything she put in front of me. She was so excited. She took me by the hand and led me to the principals office. This was actually one of the few times I went to the principals for a good reason! When we got to the office Mrs. Jones called my mom and shared the good news. She told everyone in the office, This boy can read! I felt like a million bucks. I will never forget what Mrs. Jones told me that day. She said, Charley, you can do anything you want as long as you put your mind to it. I had the courage to believe her. So whenever I read a book or the Bible I think of Mrs. Jones and the way she opened my eyes to the person I could be. She told me face to face that she believed in me. So when I wrote my first book, guess who received the first copy? Mrs. Jones. I inscribed the book this way: To Mrs. Jones  thanks for teaching me how to read so I would know how to write! I am so grateful to Mrs. Jones for teaching me how to read. All of us should be grateful if we have been taught to read. Sometimes we take for granted how important it is that we have learned to read. Consider these statistics: -1 in 4 children in America grow up without learning how to read. -2/3 of students who cannot read proficiently by the end of 4th grade will end up in jail or on welfare. -Over 70% of Americas inmates cannot read above 4th grade level. -Students who don't read proficiently by the 3rd grade are 4 times likelier to drop out of school. -Nearly 85% of the juveniles who face trial in the juvenile court system are functionally illiterate, proving that there is a close relationship between illiteracy and crime. (dosomething.org) It is because of these statistics that we have a mentor program at Gulfport Elementary. We have folks from our church who go to Gulfport each week and help students learn how to read. One of the most important reasons for reading is for feasting on the Bible. It is our source of strength. Reading it regularly gives us the spiritual nutrients we need to follow Christ. But if we cant read, we cant be nourished. So to help us remember to be nourished by the Bible let us all read these passages together: No one can live only on food. People need every word that God has spoken. Matthew 4:4 I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread. Job 23:12 Coach Earnest Killum (Killem)  Cant Never Could! Coach Killum was my first tennis coach. Some of our finest teachers are coaches. Here is a picture of Coach Earnest Killum. He played for the Lakers in the early 70s! He was also my P.E. coach when I was in elementary school and went on to be a school principal in Atlanta. Coach Killem lived up to his name. He would work me until I almost collapsed. He would run me ragged around the tennis court. I would complain and he would always ask me, Do you want to be a good tennis player or a great tennis player? Do you want to win? One of the things he would make me do was wear weights around each of my ankles while I practiced. It was rough. Running after balls became such a chore, and my legs would be so sore afterwards. One day I was so tired that I said a terrible four letter word! I said, I cant. Coach Killum stopped everything, glared at me across the net and said, Charley, you need to get that word out of your vocabulary! Cant never could! Now, thatll preach! He was right! So I kept on running around with those weights. When I showed up to my next match without the weights I was amazed how swiftly I ran around the court. I beat the tar out of my opponentin Jesus name, of course. There are lots of four letter words we need to get out of our vocabulary and cant is one of them! The writer of Hebrews reminds us of this: Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:1-2 The word cant was not in the Apostle Pauls vocabulary either. He would write these words from a prison cell: Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable-if anything is excellent and praiseworthy-think about such things. Philippians 4:8 What this biblical wisdom is saying in a nut shell is this: We become what we think about. You are the accumulation of all your thoughts. If you dont like who you are or where you are, change your thinking. If you think you cant you wont. If you think you can you will! Neil T. Anderson, in his book ""Victory Over Darkness,"" tells a thrilling story about a little girl born with major health problems which left her crippled. Anderson says, She had a large, wonderful Christian family. But while her brothers and sisters enjoyed running and playing outside, she was confined to braces. She asked, will I ever be able to run and play like the other children? Her parents said, Honey, keep on believing and trying. God can work wonders. Not only did she believe; she worked at it, trying to walk short distances without her braces, assisted by her brothers and sisters. On her 12th birthday, her braces were removed and she walked out of the doctor's office unassisted. By the age of 16 she was a star on the basketball team and one of the best young runners in America. She went to the Olympics in Australia and won a bronze metal. Four years later in Rome she won three gold medals and set a world's record. She capped the year by receiving the prestigious Sullivan Award as the most outstanding amateur athlete in America. Her name? Wilma Rudolph. With Gods help it can be done. Rudolph said, The triumph cannot be had without the struggle. About to give up on something? Think you cant? Get the word cant out of your vocabulary and ask God to help you. He will. Mrs. Kitchel Oh Dear! Mrs. Kitchel was my 5th grade math teacher. She was a tough teacher. In fact, some called her mean. I dont know about that but she was tough and didnt put up with anything but your best. Many of you will not be surprised to know that I wasnt always the best student in my younger days. When I was a kid, being anywhere but outside playing a sport was torture. Of course, math itself was the worst kind of torture for me. I was terrible at math. Im still terrible at math. Mrs. Kitchel was very perceptive. She had x-ray eyes that could see right through you. She also had a sixth sense. She could tell who did and did not do their homework just by the way they walked into her classroom. Of course, she would intentionally call on students who didnt do their homework. And it would always go like this. She would call on the student. The student would slump down and say, I didnt do my homework. And Mrs. Kitchel would reply, Oohhhhh Dear! I think we are going to have to call mother. One day I showed up without doing my homework. I didnt have a good excuse. I just didnt do it because I was having too much fun playing. And I knew she was going to call on me. And she did. When I told her I didnt do my homework, she said it: Oohhhhh Dear! I think we are going to have to call mother! She took me straight to the principals office and called my mom! A fate worse than death in the fifth grade! And let me tell you, I always did my homework after that! It may not have been right, but I did it! Sometimes the toughest teachers end up being our favorite teachers. We may not like them at the time, but later we realize the wisdom they taught us. My geography teacher in high school proves my point but not in the way you might think. His name was Mr. George and he was the golf coach. He was a wonderful man but why they had him teaching geography I will never know. The only thing we did in his class was watch action movies. Now, that was fine with me. I love First Blood and The Poseidon Adventure and so did the rest of the class. Students were dying to get into that class. All you had to do was show up and watch Rambo save the day and write paragraph summaries of all the movies you watched. Now, what that had to do with geography I dont know, but none of us cared. Of course, at the end of the class none of us could tell you where Nebraska was on a map! Mr. George didnt teach me much but Mrs. Kitchel taught me two key virtues that are essential for spiritual growth and success  discipline and accountability. She held me accountable and made sure I had the discipline to do my work. If you want to grow as a person and succeed at anything you must have discipline. It is impossible without it. And what is discipline exactly? Discipline means to train oneself to do something virtuous in a controlled and habitual way. It takes time and patience. Discipline is dedicating yourself to a worthy goal by practicing excellence in pursuit of that goal on a regular basis. Why do you think we call prayer, fasting, Bible study, worship, and service spiritual disciplines? These disciplines help shape us as children of God and enable us to grow as Christians. Take a look at what the Bible says about discipline: No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it. Hebrews 12:11 My child, do not despise the LORDs discipline or be weary of his reproof, for the LORD reproves the one he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights. Proverbs 3:11-12 Rev. Brad Dinsmore  What Do You Want to Do with Your Life? Many ministers are great teachers and Rev. Brad Dinsmore was to me. He definitely inspired me. Brad was my minister throughout my teenage years. He taught me that preaching can change lives because his preaching changed mine. This is why preaching is my first love and the foundation of my ministry. As a 14 year old kid, I would sit in the front row of the sanctuary anticipating Brads sermons. His sermons moved me, inspired me, taught me and empowered me. After a while a fire began to develop inside me to do the same thing Brad was doing. I wanted to preach the gospel and change lives. Brad was a discerning soul and he recognized my sense of call. One day after worship as I was shaking his hand he looked at me and said, I want to know what you want to do with the rest of your life. Lets go to lunch this week and talk about it. And so we did. And so began my journey to become a preacher. Brad inspired me because he saw my potential and took the time to talk with me about it. He saw God working in my life. He was the catalyst in getting me started on the journey God had for me  all because he took the time to ask me a question. Sometimes our greatest teachers are those who recognize what we are capable of before we are able to recognize it. God has a calling for each of us. God has gifted you with a passion and a gift for something. I love this definition of a calling: When your greatest passion intersects with one of the worlds greatest needs. Look at what the Bible has to say about Gods call upon our lives: For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Jeremiah 29:11 He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. Philippians 1:6 Is God calling you to do something to make a difference in this world? Dont ignore the call. If you would like to speak with me about it, I would love to talk about it with you. Dr. Bill Self  With Conviction! Dr. Bill Self was my childhood minister growing up in Atlanta. Some of you may remember that he preached here at Pasadena a few years ago. Bill was a brilliant preacher and was the lead pastor of one "
