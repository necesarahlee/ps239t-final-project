May our words, our meditations and our prayers today please you, honor you and glorify you. Please set each of our hearts afire by the Spirit of the living God, so that revival, refreshment and renewal will take place in our life and, outside this church, in the nation of China. Because you love every single one here, and it is your desire that we be with you where you are. So be glorified, because we pray in the marvelous and matchless name of Jesus. Amen.I greet you in the precious name of Jesus. Last week Pastor Jessica started chapter 12 with the theme:  HYPERLINK ""http://english.hdchurch.org/html/news/2011/0724/233.html"" \t ""_blank"" Jesus is Worthy. Jesus is worthy, as clearly shown in Marthas work, Lazarus Witness (from death to life) and Marys Worship (the poured-out perfume). Jesus is truly, magnificently worthy. Today we have three parts in our passage: 14:1-6The Fathers Place14:7-14The Fathers Presence14: 15-31The Fathers Power    We have three subdivisions for the first part, The Fathers Place:14:1Heart14:2-3Heaven14:4,6HighwayThey all begin with an H so it can be an easy way for you to remember. So next time when you are on a bus, trying to remember what this passage is about, youll know it explains Heart, Heaven and Highway.I. TroublesA. The Troubles of My FriendsIs there anyone out there with troubles? Some of you will say: Oh no, Im fine; I dont have any troubles. Meanwhile someone will say: I have so many troubles that it will take me a year to tell you all of them in detail. I have a friend who has a lot of troubles. Her phone rang in the morning; it was from her son. He said: Mum, I just want to let you know that I am in the hospital. I overdosed some drugs, because I wanted to take my life. But I dont want you to come here; I want to handle this by myself. Bye.  and then he hang up the phone. I have another friend. His professor is giving him a lot of pressure because the professor wants him to change his PhD subject. The professor doesnt understand why he wants to talk about the law of God, which has, in the professors opinion, nothing to do with his law degree. The professor wants him to forget about God, finish his PhD and get out. This friend of mine also has financial problems; it has been really hard for him to find a job, because he is so compassionate. There are many people who need legal help, and he offers it for free. So he has no money. He also has a war at home. His wife is hostile to Christianity. He thought he had found the love of his life when they got married, but when he became a Christian, the war broke out. There has been war daily for a few years: she will have nothing to do with him and his God. He has troubles. There are lots of troubles in this world, isnt there? B. The Troubles of the WorldI looked up the website of the World Health Organization, and found some results of their researches:By 2020, depression will become a leading health problem worldwide.Currently depression is the No.3 cause of death for 10-24 yr olds.It is estimated that in the European Union depression costs 170 billion US dollars; in the US 70 billion; in Japan 32 billion.We know in Japan every year for the last twelve years, over 30,000 people have committed suicide.  There are a lot of troubles out there.C. The Troubles of the DisciplesThe disciples of Jesus had lots of problems too. Remember what Jesus was telling them? He told them: I am going to be betrayed by one of you; one who is close to me and shares his bread with me. He is going to kick me and betray me.Jesus also said that Peter was going to deny Him for three times (not just once, not even twice). Then He spoke about His death: it was not going to be a peaceful death, but a death on the cross. He spoke about His departure; He said: We have been together for the last three years. It has been fun and precious, but now I have to go. Where are you going?His disciples asked. Jesus replied: I am going to my Father. Can we come? You cannot follow me right now. Why? We have followed you this far; we have forsaken everything! We want to follow you! I want to lay down my life for you. said Peter. I am sorry; you cannot follow me right now.The disciples had troubles. And they were going to face the three darkest days in history: not only in their personal historythey had to see their loved one hanging on a cross and then buried; but there also was the silence of God upon the land. That was trouble.

Jesus Three CommandsBut Jesus did not leave them in their troubles. He had three commands for them: A. Heart (John 14: 1)John 14:1 Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in Me. There is a tide wave of trouble in my life, but Jesus said: Do not let your hearts be troubled. No matter how big, how severe or how dark the situation is, do not let your heart be troubled. Okay, if I do not let my heart be troubled, what must I do? Trust in God; trust also in Me. This is what Jesus is saying: I am God; trust My Father, as I do; as I face the cross, trust in Me, because I am God; I am able to do more than you can ask or imagine. Trust, trust, trust. Trust! Trust! Trust! Application Question No.1: Having heard what Jesus has said, how will you change when responding to your troubles?Principle No.1: Trust in Jesus who is GodThe Bible always has the answers for every essential question. When we read Isaiah 26:3-4, we see the principle:Isaiah 26:3 You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you. Isaiah 26:4 Trust in the LORD forever, for the LORD, the LORD himself, is the Rock eternal.Apart from Trust, there is something else that I would like to highlight: Perfect Peace.Those who want perfect peace please raise your hands. A few of you do; maybe because the rest of you have no troubles.Perfect peace is not a change of circumstances; it is not things arranged the way I would like them to be; it is not about getting my way. Perfect peace is a question of authority and focus.Authority? Focus? Maybe you dont understand me. Maybe you think it is too hard. Whats authority? Let me put it in an easy way: Who reigns in your heart? Is it the Prince of Peace? Or is it the father of lies? If it is the Prince of Peace, you will have perfect peace. If it is the father of lies, you will have great great trouble. So it is the question of authority; and you alone can answer that question.Whats focus? If you focus on trouble, guess what you will see? Trouble. If you focus on Jesus, guess what you will see? Jesus. How do we apply this principle to the troubles we are facing? When trouble comes, Trust Focuses On: Faith, but not our feelingsI am going to focus on faith, but not on my feelings. It is not what I feel, or what I think. It is what the Bible says. Thats what faith says: I trust in God, because He exists and everything He says is true, while my feelings may mislead me. In fact for a lot of times my feelings do mislead me. We know God is calling us not to trust our feelings but trust faith. Promises, but not our possessionsGod is calling us not to trust in how many possessions we have, but to trust in His promises. All the wealth and the possession that I have cannot solve anything; but Gods promises can solve everything. So in what am I going to trust next time? I am going to trust His promises. Position, but not our situationI am not going to say: Oh only if my situation is just better! Please change my situation! Please change my professor! Please change my boss! Please please please change everything else! No. Trust in who God says you are: You are My child. You are my son. You are my daughter. I am your Heavenly Father. And I will take care of you from the start to the finish. I brought you into this world and I will work with you until the end. You can trust in your position with the Father. Prayer, but not our powerSay to God: I am so weak. I have no wisdom. I just need You and You alone. And I know that You love to glorify Yourself when I am weak.Those are the tips that you need to remember. Next time you will have perfect peace in the midst of your trouble. B. Heaven John 14:2 In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. John 14:3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. Now there is a place that has perfect peace, and it is called Heaven. Jesus said in the next 2 verses: The reason that I have to leave you is that I am going to prepare a place for you. In my Fathers house there are many rooms. I am going to prepare a place for you. So that where I am, you may be also.So we learn 3 things about this place: * It is a Populated Place (14:2)* It is a Prepared Place (14:2)* It is a Personal Place (14:3)What does a populated place mean? Jesus said many rooms. Do you know how big the city is going to be? It is said it is approximately 2,300 kilometers long on each side. How long will it take you to walk 2,300 kilometers? Its a big city. It has a lot of rooms. And God is inviting everyone who would believe. Come. Come into this beautiful city. Jesus Father has enough room for everyone who would like to respond and come. This invitation is for every nation, every town and every tribe; there are no exclusions. God invites each and every one of you. You can never be too sinful. You can never be too far away. If it is your desire to know God, then He extends this invitation to you so that you can have a room in His house. Its Daddys house. Secondly we know it is a prepared place. Youve got to have this picture of Jesus being the bridegroom, and He says to His bride: I am going to prepare the best place for you. I am so in love with you. Im going to prepare the best place for you. So close your eyes for a little while and let Me prepare the house for you. You are going to be so amazed at what I have for you.  What has He prepared for us? a Happy place, with no more sorrows and no more sufferings.a Holy place, with no more sins and no more Satan. a Huge place, a place that accommodates every town and every nation.a Precious place. What are the walls made of? Precious gems. What are the streets made of? Pure gold. What are the gates made of? Pearls. Jesus goes to every expense, and He says: You are worthy; you are my bride; you are precious to me. So our home will be really precious. It is also a personal place, because Jesus said: I am coming back. You dont know when I am coming, but I am coming back. So that where I am, you may be also. I am not only sending out an invitation. I am going to come back, give you the invitation, take you by the hand and we will go together. In fact, He tells us that we are going to fly. We are going to rise into the sky to meet our Savior in the air. Isnt that going to be spectacular? Fly and meet Him to see Him as He is. I want to be there! Because it is a populated place, a prepared place and a personal place; because God is there. Where God is, that is Heaven. And we will have a place where He will be the Light and His Son the Lamb will be the Lamp. For the children, there will be no more sleeping and no more nights. You can play all day long, because Jesus is the Light. And Gods glory will shine and shine and shine. What are we going to do when we are awake all day? We are going to worship: HOLY, HOLY, HOLY! Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come! With whom are we going to worship? All the believers from the past, the present and the future. We are going to sing together. Isnt that a beautiful place? Dont you want to go there? Application Question No.2:When you are going to travel aboard, some preparations are required. Similarly, how will you prepare for Heaven, the wonderful place? Principle No.2: Be Heavenly-MindedThe principle for this question is to be Heavenly-minded. The more Heavenly- minded we are, the more earthly-good we are to be.It is said in Colossians: Set your heart, set your mind on things above where Christ is seated. Thats what Heavenly-minded means. Everything that God treasures; everything that God values; everything about God; everything that God is doing is your delight. So what does being Heavenly-minded look like? I have written down a few thoughts for you to see: * Jesus is 1st in everything* Live for Eternal Treasure, not for earthly pleasures* Joy in sufferingI am not saying you should want lots of sufferings. I am saying that your relationship with God is so intimate that you see Jesus holding you in the midst of your severest suffering. You read Isaiah and Jesus says to you: Everything is going to be OK, my son. Everything is going to be OK, my daughter. The storm is really rough, but everything is going to be really OK, because I love solving impossibilities.* Love for the lostYou have the love for the lost. Because you want to fill Heaven with all your old friends and all your new friends and all the people that you dont know but God has put into your life. You want to fill Heaven with people. Because Jesus says He has lots of roomsDad says He has lots of rooms in Heaven for you. Come, come! * Holiness is supremeWithout holiness, no one can see Lord. * Desire & strength to overcome sinSin no more, sin no more, sin no more! Separate yourself from sin!So that is what a Heavenly-minded person looks like, and I pray that this will be a gift that the Holy Spirit will bless you with.

Highway John 14:4 You know the way to the place where I am going."" John 14:6 Jesus answered, ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life. The only way to the Father is through me. John 14:7 If you really knew me, you would know my Father, too. But now you do know him, and you have seen him.""Now, Heaven seems kind of far away, how do I get there? By Highway. God says: Ive got a Highway for you. You are a pilgrim; you are journeying and Ive got a Highway for you. And Jesus declares in a loud voice: I am the way, the truth and the life. I am the way, the truth and the life. Then what do you mean, Jesus, you are the way, the truth and the life? 1. Jesus is the WayWell, let us recall what happened in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve, they sinned. And as the result of their sin, all of us, like our fathers and our mothers, have been sin-stained. And so we were born lost. We were born separated from God. We were born not knowing how to get back to the Father. He had kicked out Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve are no longer perfect and no longer holy. And we too have broken the communion with God. How can we get back to God? How can we get back to God? God says: I have a solution. My Son Jesus is the way back to Me. My son Jesus, by His death on your behalf, opens the way of Heaven, so that you can come back to Me. And My Son, He stands at the right-hand side of the throne interceding for you, so that you are always present before me. My Son is the way back to me.Jesus is the only way to the Father. We have offended the Father and He says the only solution is His Son. The only way to run this race is to run in the right direction and cross the finish line. Thats the only way. You cant go the opposite way. You cant go off the track. You have to stay on the course. And the course, the way, is our Lord Jesus Christ. 2. Jesus is the TruthWhen Adam and Eve sinned, they also lost their knowledge of God. They became darkened in their understanding. And they didnt know God any more. Jesus came as the truth about God. He came to review who God is, to review Gods character and to review His words and His work, so that we can know this God again. And so He gives us the true knowledge of who God is.3. Jesus is the LifeAnd then finally Jesus is the life. Remember that when Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden, they were destined to die. Death had entered the world and every single person was destined to die. But Jesus says: You dont have to die.What? Jesus: I have conquered death. I have raised many people and I raised myself from death. I have conquered death, so that you no longer have to die.Jesus came to set us free form sin, Satan and death. And so you are free! Thats why Jesus is the way, the truth and life. Application Question No.3:How will the truth about Jesus, that He is the way, the truth and the life, deepen your relationship with God? Principle No.3: Value Jesus above Everything ElseI believe that its about value. I believe that if we are going to deepen our relationship with God, then God, our Lord Jesus Christ, has to become the highest value in our lives. I remember St. Augustine once said: Jesus Christ is not valued at all until He is valued above all. Jesus has to be your highest value. He has to be your highest value. If you cannot value Him above everything else in your whole life, then you are not valuing Jesus worthily. You have to value Him above everything, even life itself. Jesus Christ is not valued at all until He is valued above everything.In conclusion, I want you to look at:John 3:16: For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him, shall not perish but have eternal life. For GodThe Greatest Love-GiverSo lovedThe Greatest MeasureThe worldThe Greatest NumberThat He gaveThe Greatest ActHis One & Only SonThe Greatest GiftThat whoeverThe Greatest InvitationBelieves The Greatest SimplicityIn HimThe Greatest PersonShall not perishThe Greatest PromiseBut The Greatest DifferenceHave The Greatest CertaintyEternal lifeThe Greatest PossessionGod is great. And God is worthy, worthy to be worshiped, worthy to be lived for and worthy to die for, because He offers you the greatest love: He loves at the greatest measure, in the greatest number with the greatest act, with the greatest gift, with the greatest invitation, with the greatest simplicity, with the greatest person, with the greatest promise, the greatest difference, the greatest certainty and the greatest possession. Is there anybody greater than God? Certainly not. Absolutely not. As we sing today, its our hearts desire that each and every one of us will live for Him and Him alone, because He alone is worthy. Praise God to the highest. With love and strength in Jesus Christ, summarized by Katherine, Jane and Chong."

God, our Father, you are the gardener, and our Lord Jesus Christ, you are the vine; the true beautiful life-given vine. Father, weve come this morning to empty ourselves so that you may fill us with your life. Empty ourselves of everything that is not of you because you alone are worthy to occupy the throne of our hearts. So, Father, speak to us today with your beautiful Word by Your Spirit. May we be transformed into fruitful branches that bear forever lasting life.  We pray in Jesus name, Amen.Good morning, everyone. The sharing that I have is for those people who have a great life and for those people who are not having a great life; for those people who are going through difficulties and for those people who are just soaring on the wings of an eagle and just enjoying Gods presence. Todays story is about grapes. Grapes! Actually grapes are a big business. GrapesWorld Vineyards25 million acresWorld Productions72 million tonsU.S. Economy$162 billionWhen we look at the world production, it is about 72 million tons of grapes. When we take a look at what the economic impact is in just one country, the United States, grapes have 162 billion dollars impact. So grapes are fairly significant. Grapes, as we know, are good for our health; they are good for our heart and for our cardiovascular system; and they are also good with antioxidants for healthy cells. Last week when we were studying together in the Gospel of John, Chapter 14, we said that there were three divisions that we looked at together. We looked at the heart, the heaven, and the highway. Jesus said I am the way, the truth, and the life. We concluded that if Jesus is not valued at all if Jesus is not valued above all. Jesus has to be above all.Chapter 14:1-6Jesus is not valued at all until He is valued above allVerse 1HeartVerses 2-3HeavenVerses 4, 6HighwayIn Chapter 15 which we are going to study right now, we are going to look at the key words. It will not come as a surprise to you that the word will appears 12 times, the word remain 11 times, father and love each 10 times, and then fruit 9 times. Key Words in John 15Will12 timesRemain11 timesFather10 timesLove10 timesFruit9 timesLook at the word will.  Remember the context: Jesus is in his last hours before his betrayal, before he is handed over to those wicked men, and before he is crucified. He is in his last hours of this very dark time, and he is saying to his disciples: Hang in there because I have some beautiful promises for you. Just hang in there. Its really dark but I will fulfill my promises to you. No matter how distant the fulfillment of those promises is, I will fulfill them to you.The other key word that youve seen is of course the word remain. We will talk a little about remaining and what that means. Doesnt it come as a surprise that father is very frequent? It is because Jesus wants to tell them, You may see me suffer and you may see me die, and you may think I thought he said he was God, but I tell you that I am God; the heavenly Father and I are one. As we turn to Chapter 15, we have three divisions. Divisions 15Verses 1-6FruitVerses 7-14FriendsVerses 15-31FoesIt is very easy for you to follow: fruit, friends, and foes. He says, I want you to remain in me and bear fruit. I want you to love one another and be friends to the end, because its going to be hard and its going to be persecution. You are going to meet many foes but do not worry. My Holy Spirit is with you. Chapter 15:1-8 DivisionsVerses 1-3A Pure LifeVerses 4-7A Productive LifeVerse 8A Purposeful LifeOur chapter with the passage we are going to look at is actually the first eight verses. We are going to divide them up also into three divisions. A pure life is in verses 1-3. A productive life is in verses 4-7. A purposeful life is in the last verse, verse 8. HYPERLINK ""http://english.hdchurch.org/uploads/allimg/110808/1Z95U331-0.jpg"" \t ""_blank""  INCLUDEPICTURE ""http://english.hdchurch.org/uploads/allimg/110808/1Z95U331-0.jpg"" \* MERGEFORMATINET A Pure Life  vv.1-3Lets look at the first verse in Chapter 15, it says, I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener. God chose Israel to be His light in the world. They were supposed to shine so that people would see their good works and praise God.  Unfortunately they failed to bear any fruit because they wanted to do this through their own self effort; through their own will. And so Jesus says, Yes, you have failed. Yes, you have not shone for my father so my father sent me to be the true vine; the one who really bore that fruit that God was speaking; and the one who would give the true life that every single human being needs - eternal life. So He is the true and final and ultimate vine that pleases God in every single way. He says that my father is the gardener. He owns this world. He is the one that is in charge. He is the one that sets our boundaries. And he is the one that we are to come forward to. Now what does the father do? He says in Verse 2: He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit. So as a creator, as the owner of this vineyard, as the owner of this land, and as the owner of us, He expects fruit. He invests His time, energy, love, and every effort into you and me so that we can bear fruit. His expectation is very clear. We cannot just live life and say, I can just live life and be under-performing. No. God expects you to bear fruit as much as a clock maker expects his clock to tell the time, as much as light is supposed to shine, and as much as life like yours is supposed to bear fruit to glorify God. That is the expectation. He cuts off those that bear no fruit. But then what about those that are bearing fruit? Maybe we get a break, may be life is going to be just easy for us, because we are bearing fruit and we are doing something. Let us see what Verse 2 tells us. It says, While every branch that does bear fruit, he rewards? And he gets rest? No. He prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. He prunes; He cuts off and he cleanses. What? Isnt it just sufficient enough to bear a little bit of fruit. Why do you have to cut off? Why do you have to prune? It is so painful. You dont know how painful it is to lose a loved one. You dont know how painful it is to lose a loved one. You dont know how painful it is to lose everything. You dont know how painful it is. Why do I have to be pruned and bearing a little bit of fruit? Is that not sufficient? God is removing the good so that you will have room for the better.  God is removing the better so that you can have the best. He is removing the best for the most excellent. Ouch! It hurts, but its for the excellent; its for the most infinitely excellent. Okay! I will trust you. He prunes, so that we can have infinitely most excellent life; nothing less, because the person who loves you infinitely says, You are the one on whom I desire infinite excellence, the best of everything that I can give. Now you see that pruning has a purpose. Now you see that the person thats given you difficulties in your life has a purpose. Now you see the trials that are testing you have a purpose. Now you see those inexplicable pains have a purpose. Nothing is by accident. Our Father has your excellent best in mind for you.Okay, if thats so, Lord, lets carry on. He says, in the next verse: You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. (John 15:3) All of us who believe in Jesus as our savior, we are forgiven; and we are forgiven not just yesterdays sins, but we are forgiven todays sins and tomorrows sins. We are no longer enemies. We are no longer lovers of darkness. Were no longer children of disobedience. Were no longer children of wrath. We are friends of God. I have no friends. I have the best friend: a friend who will stick with me forever; a friend who will be there always; a friend who is forever faithful; a friend whose opinion of me is very accurate and true; a friend who knows me better than myself; a friend of God; a friend who can speak heart to heart without condemnation, without guilt, without shame, without judgment; a friend - a true friend at last. That friends name is Jesus. His name is Jesus and He cleanses you from every stain of sin when you confess your sins to Him, and receive Him as your personal savior. Principle  It is not great talents or great learning or great preachers that God needs, but men great in holiness.Before we go into our next verse, let me share with you the principle for our section here: It is not great talents, its not great learning, and its not great preachers that God needs. What God is looking for is men, women, and children great in holiness. Holiness! Application Question  How can you keep your life holy?The questions that I have for you and for myself are then, Holiness, what is that?, How can I make holiness a priority of my life?, How can holiness be more and more important in my life?, How can I keep my life holy?Application AnswerConfessionRecognizeMindContritionRemorseEmotionsConvictionResolveWillConversionRepentanceLifeWell, there are a few things. Confession - There is confession. When you agree with God and you say, Lord, I have sinned and I know that I have sinned. Contrition  There is contrition. I really feel sorry that Ive hurt you,. Not only do I acknowledge in my mind, but I acknowledge in my heart and in my feelings. Yes, I feel really sorry that Ive grieved you so much. Conviction  There is conviction. I know, without a doubt in my will, that I dont want to sin any more. Conversion - And then there is conversion. I am going to change my life right, one hundred percent, three hundred and sixty degrees. I want my life to be wholly yours. The big challenge that we have, I believe, is whats in our heart. The Bible tells us when Jesus was being tempted, He said to the devil, It is written Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only. (Luke 4:8) Worship Him alone and serve Him alone. Our biggest problem is not our circumstances, not our hurts, nor our pains. Our biggest challenge is the idols in our heart. God created us to worship Him and Him alone; to serve Him and Him alone. It has been said that our hearts are an idol factory. We love ourselves too much at the expense of God. We fix that one thing, then well see everything else clear up and resolve very beautifully. If you want to start a new life, a pure life, and a holy life, then deal with this issue. Thats what Jesus did. Remember that He went to the temple. He saw what was going on in the temple and then He came back in, made a whip, and He just cleared that temple out. He said, God is here, and I have come to dwell with you. Ive come to dwell in your heart, but your heart is not worthy until I have cleansed it to make it a temple holy onto me. You are a holy priesthood. You are Gods holy people. The next time that youre tempted to sin, or to do anything impure, I beg you, please remember that your heart is Gods holy temple. Holy almighty God is your friend and He desires to live in you in a holy place. Set apart just for Him. After all, He is your bridegroom, and He deserves the very best.

This is where the word remains appears very often. We are going to jump to Verse 5 where it says, I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. (John 15:5)The essential picture here is that God is saying, If you are going to live a life - a real life, and if you are going to have a life of infinite value, of divine value, a life thats going to please me, you must be connected to me. Just like a lamp has to be connected; its electrical cord has to be connected to shine, you must be connected to me. Just like a branch, it has to be connected to the vine for the life sap to live through the branch and produce fruit. God is saying that we cannot do anything without Him. But if I just gave a million dollars, surely thats okay. You know, wouldnt God accept that? I just sacrificed all my time, surely thats okay, isnt it? I give to God; I serve God; I do everything possible under the sun. Is that okay? Yes, if youre doing it for His glory. If youre doing it for yourself, then it counts for nothing. If youre doing it to please Him and by His strength, and if youre doing it for His pleasure and for His glory, then, yes, it will count for eternity. This whole thing of abiding is living. I have been trying to figure out how I can picture that for you. Well, maybe its like a fish in water. Its living. Thats where it lives. Thats where it thrives. That is where it belongs. Its in its element, right? It cant live outside of the water, right? Breath! I cant live too long without breath, without oxygen, without breathing. Im getting old so my lungs dont keep me under the water as long as it used to. I cant live; I cant take an extra step or any step without the life of God in me. I cant think for myself without His help. I cant do anything of value or worth without His help. I cant exist without Him. He is just an absolute necessity, a vital part of me and of you.The Bible tells us in Him we live, we move, and have our being. Does this describe you? It should, because God wants you. He wants to be your life. He wants to be everything for you. Nothing less than excellent, He says, Nothing less than the best. He wants the totally, upmost, infinitely, excellent best for you. Why settle for anything other than the life of God in you? Why, when you are destined for that?  God loves you so much, doesnt He? God loves us.  When we take a look at the next verse, it says Anyone that does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire, and burned. This is a quick warning. He says, You know, you have been coming to church a lot, youve been saying a lot of prayers, youve been fellowshipping with a lot of Christians, but its time to make that commitment.Proximity to Christ does not guarantee salvation. Remember Judas? He spent a lot of time with Jesus. He said the right things, he looked the right part, but God is warning all of us who are pretenders, all those who may pretend. Hes saying, I have a warning for you. And the time is now to change; the time is now to connect with me. Connect with me and have real life. Otherwise, youre dry and withered up, and lifeless. And I dont want that for you. Okay? When I take a look at this particular verse, it reminds me of the passage that says, Make the most of every opportunity. And the time is now to make that opportunity golden for you.Principle  Without Jesus, fruit is impossible. With Jesus, fruit is inevitable.What is this principle for this particular division? Without Jesus, fruit is impossible. With Jesus, fruit is inevitable. If you want a new life, if you want a pure life, and a productive life, connect with Jesus. Application question  How can you be more like Jesus?Matthew 4:4 Jesus answered, It is written: Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God How can we do that? How can we be more like Jesus? How do we become more like Christ? Well, I just have one suggestion - Abide in His Word. And I will give you few suggestions about abiding in His Word. Abide in His WordRead & StudyCapture thoughtsMemorize & PrayChange waysTreasure & DelightConnect feelingsSubmit & ObeyCenter life in ChristRead and Study  Capture thoughts.  The first thing that Ill like you to do is to read and study, to read and study his Word. So that is can capture your thoughts so you can think more like him.  Memorize and Pray  Change waysThen I want you to memorize and pray his Word. So that it can change you ways and your habits.  Treasure and Delight  Connect feelingsThen I want you to treasure and delight in his Word, so that your feelings can be one with your feelings. The things that break His heart, the things that rejoice His heart, will also break your heart and rejoice your heart.  Submit and Obey  Center life in ChristAnd then, Ill like you to submit and obey, so your life will always be centered upon Jesus. And thats going to help you a little bit, I believe. In abiding in Him, and experiencing the true life he has for you.

We are going to read the passage here that says, This is to my Fathers glory, that you bear much fruit, so yourselves to be my disciples. This is to my Fathers glory. Principle  A servant of God has only one Master and one Master passion.The principle here, very quickly and easily, is the servant of God has only one master and one passion - one master passion. Our master is God, and no one else. And my passion is for Him and Him alone. My master is the Lord Jesus Christ, and Im willing to die for Him. Thats what you say, thats what we say, and thats what I say, when we go to the throne. We say, God, there is none like you, there is no one to compare to you, and there is no one I desire more than you. You are the only true God in my life. And Ill do everything and anything to please you because thats my passion, for you; nothing less for the most excellent God; for the infinitely beautiful Lord Jesus Christ.Application Question  How will your life glorify God?How do I change the way that I live to glorify God? How can I start glorifying God? He mentioned a few things here: Be fruitful, and not just fruitful but abundantly fruitful.  Then He says Be my disciples. Follow me. Follow me to the ends of the earth. There are a few things He mentions in the remainder of the passage. Im going to read you those verses that tell you how to glorify him. The next verse says, If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love. Just as I have remained in my Fathers command and remain in his love. So obey and that will glorify God. Not what I feel or what I think or when I want to, but just obey. Just obey. When you hear God say Dont do it, dont do it. When you here God say Do it, do it. Just obey even when you dont feel like and even when its very costly.The second verse that I want to share with you is, Greater Love has no other than this: that he laid down his life for his friends. He says, not only obey me, but love me. Love me. Now we know thats greater love, but we did know that Jesus showed us the greatest love, because He died for His enemies. FATHER, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing. He died for His enemies. So He is calling us, love one another and then love me, even onto death. Love me in life, love me in death.  Love me when its great; love me when its not so great. Love me, love me, love me, because I have so much more for you.The final verse here, that I would like to share with you, which I wish I had more time to talk to you about is, When the councilor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth. How can we live a pure life? How can we live a productive life? How can we live a purposeful life? It can only happen if we are joined to Jesus by His Holy Spirit living in us. When the Holy Spirit, His Holy Spirit, has absolute control, absolute access to every area of your life: absolute access, absolute surrender, and absolute yieldedness in every area of your life.  Chapter 15:1-8 Divisions1-3 Pure LifePurify & Prune4-7 Productive LifePresence & Prayer8 Purposeful LifePleasure & PassionPrinciple  Our chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy HimWhen I think of our Lord Jesus Christ, and what He has done for us, how He made an enemy a friend, and how He made a friend into a bride, I cant help but say, Lord, my chief goal in life is to glorify you and to enjoy you, here on earth, and in eternity.  We know that there are many, many people who have given their life to the gospel, for this nation of China, because they loved you. They came to this land to die, to stay away from the comforts of home, from the comforts of their friendships, because God put a passion in their heart, a love in their heart for each and every one of you. And they died here in this land for the gospel to reach you. We also know that Jesus also left a far place; He left the comforts of His home and glory, because He chose you, He appointed you to be His bride. He knew all ahead of your failures, your weaknesses; He knew ahead all the times that you would hurt Him, but He said, I choose you still to be my bride. I choose you still, to be the object of my love. Now I ask you, Come to me. Follow me. And make me your life. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. Glory to God in the highest.Transcript: Shirley, Esther and YuYu.  DATE \@ ""M/d/yyyy"" 8/12/2011Fruit for My FatherStephen WongHaidian Christian Church PAGE 3 of  NUMPAGES 11"

Im running away from my mistress Sarai, she answered. 9 Then the angel of the LORD told her, Go back to your mistress and submit to her. 10 The angel added, I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count. 11 The angel of the LORD also said to her:   You are now pregnant   and you will give birth to a son.You shall name him Ishmael,   for the LORD has heard of your misery.12 He will be a wild donkey of a man;   his hand will be against everyone   and everyones hand against him,and he will live in hostility   toward all his brothers. 13 She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her: You are the God who sees me, for she said, I have now seen the One who sees me. 14 That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered. 15 So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne. 16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.Sermon by Pastor Jessica WangGood morning my dear brothers and sisters, Im very happy to see you here. We can hear from our God and we can worship our God. Lets bow down and pray to our God: Dear Lord our God, we know you are the God who cares for us, we know you are the God who sees us, and we know you are the God who is still watching us. God, thank you so much for calling us here, and to worship you, and to praise you. God, I want to lift up all my brothers and sisters here into your hands, and please be with us. Lord, we come to you. We want to ask you to purify us and be with us, because we know that God you love us, and God you want to show your love to us, and you want to show your wisdom and your words to us. Today we ask you to send Holy Spirit among us and strengthen us. Let us see your presence. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Several weeks ago, after one worship service, a young couple came to my office and asked me to pray for their child, their one-year-old daughter, because she developed a disease in her eyes. They had to have a surgery after the service. When I saw this little lovely girl, I felt very sad. She had very beautiful eyes, and because of this disease, she had to remove one of her eyes. At that time, I knew that there was no word that could comfort the couple and the young girl. I just held her hand, and prayed for her. I knew no matter what kind of situation they were in, God would be with them. Even though they could not feel Gods presence, God was still with them. So I just prayed that God could strengthen them, and that God could confirm their faith, and that God could heal them and be with them.So many tragedies took place in recent weeks, such as the bullet train that crashed in Wenzhou, costing the lives of many. And also in Soul, a mud-rock flow took away peoples homes and lives. Besides, just a week ago, there was a riot in the UK, in which many people lost their families and their lives. At these times, some cannot help but ask: Lord, where are you? Are you still watching over us? How can we face this ugly world?  This is the question that is sometimes in my mind too. But when I read Bible, I realize that God is the one who sees us; God is the one who is still watching over us. Thats why today Im going to share with you The God Who Sees.Before I begin, I want to teach you the Hebrew word for the God who sees. Just now when Dong Hao was reading the scripture, we realized that there was a word which was difficult to pronounce. That was the word, El Roi. In the story, there is a servant named Hagar. She gives God one name El Roi, which in Hebrew means the God who sees. It means God is still watching us-this is one of Gods characteristics. Read after me please: El Roi. If you are to forget what I spoke today, I hope you can remember this very simple word, El Roi, the God who sees.Genesis chapter 16 deals with a familys problem of having no child. Although God has promised Abram that their offspring will be as many as the stars in the sky, Abram remains childless. So the family decides to take matters into their own hands in Genesis chapter 16. We know that in Genesis chapter 12, God calls Abram for the first time to follow him and to go with him. Then, in chapter 13, 14 and 15, God tries to build up Arams faith. The Lord has established Abrams faith: in chapter 14 and 15 with the help of the Lord, Abram wins the war. In chapter 15 God makes a covenant with Abram. God appears to him several times and promises to him that I will give you children, and your descendents will be like the stars in the sky. Despite of all these, in Genesis 16: 1-6 this faithful man Abram was still childless. Desperate to get one child, he takes the advice of his wife, Sarai, and he sleeps with Sarais servant girl.  Then the servant girl becomes pregnant. At first Sarais advice seems to be a quick and easy solution to their problem, but it triggers an avalanche of new problems. Now that Hagar is pregnant, she grows proud and stops obeying Sarai. In the end she runs away from Sarai. Today, we are going to focus on what happens then to Hagar.For whom does God care?Sometimes we think that it is the people who hear Gods will and obey that are watched over by God. That is true. Sometimes we feel that if we disobey and sin against God, He will never care for us and will abandon us. But according to this scripture, God not only takes care of those who obey him, but also those who are weak and who repent. This is the first message that I want to share with you.How does our God care for us? In 16:7, the angle of the Lord finds Hagar near the spring in the desert. Then they have a conversation. I find out from this conversation that God uses one special way to help us and to care for us-He uses his word. He speaks to us and his words can heal us, guide us, strengthen us and give us wisdom. His words can show us the right path and the key to our problems. In this conversation in the desert God takes care of Hagar with his words in three different ways: He reminds Hagar, guides Hagar and also makes Hagar a promise. RemindingFirst of all, God tenderly reminds Hagar. He asks: Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going? These are the first words that God speaks to Hagar. We know that by now the proud Hagar has escaped from Abram and his family. Hagar is the one who has sinned against God because of her pride. But when God finds her in the desert and when the angle of God comes to speak to her, the angle of God doesnt start by criticizing her. God does not ask: Why do you think you are here? Because you have sinned against me. If you repent, I will show you the way; but if not, I will never help you. This is not the way that God speaks to Hagar. When God speaks, he just tenderly asks: Hi Hagar, where have you come from? And where are you going? God knows everything. Does God not know where she has come from and where she is going to go? He knows. God is the one who knows everything; he even knows our hearts and souls. But still God chooses to start the conversation by this question. I think this is the great method of God to heal the people who have sinned against him. God is a great counselor. Sometimes when we talk to people who sins against God, we tell them the problem directly; but then we find out that this is a useless way to persuade them. But God is a much greater counselor. He does not address directly Hagars problem of pride, instead, he allows Hagar to realize on her own the result of her pride: she is out there in the desolate desert, trapped, homeless and with nowhere to go. This is a very good way which God uses to heal people-through his tender and gentle reminding.GuidanceSecondly, after Hagar confesses to God her awkward situation, the angle of God continues: Go back to your mistress and submit to her. I think this very short sentence is the order of truth. Now that Hagar has realized her arrogance, she is still unclear about what she should do next. So God points out a way for her: Go back to your mistress and submit to her. This is the order of truth. Go back. Turn away from your arrogance. And be obedient. If you do not want to die in the desert, you have to turn back. If you want to survive the wildness, you have to obedient and give up your arrogance. God guides us to safety by his words, which are the order of truth. But sometimes people regard Gods order of truth as constraints, saying that they cannot feel freedom. Sometimes, people tell me that right after they become Christians, they feel that their freedom is there no more. There are so many things that they cannot do, and because of that they do not like the law of our God. Actually the law of our God is the truth, and the truth can set us free. In Hagars example, the freedom she seeks when she runs into the desert will eventually lead her and her unborn baby to death; while Gods seemingly restrictive order demanding her obedience will save her life as well as that of her son.People may have other questions. Some admire Hagars luck because she can talk to God face to face. They are disappointed that they have never had that chance. They sigh and hope that when they face trails, problems and dark days, God could just tell them what to do directly. But my dear brothers and sisters, I want to show you another truth: that we are luckier than Hagar. Do you know why? Today, where does Gods word come from? I think most of us have the Holy Bible; maybe you dont have the same edition as I have, but we have the same book, the Holy Bible. What is in the Holy Bible? Gods word. I dont think God speaks to Hagar as much as he speaks to us. Thats why we are luckier than Hagar. So if we read the Bible, if we come to the church, if we have communication with other brothers and sisters, we can hear from God, we can know his words, his command, his law, and we can know what we should do. God offers the order of truth. Promises Moreover, God provides the promises of future. Because of Hagars contempt, she is mistreated by Sarai and she has to escape. So what happens then when she goes back and submits herself to Sarai? We dont know. We dont know the future; Hagar doesnt know the future either. That is why the angle of God doesnt stop the conversation there. He adds: I will also increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count. The angle of the Lord also says: You are now with child and you will have son, you shall name him Ishmael. For the Lord has heard your misery. There are many words that God says to Hagar, among which this is the promise that God makes: I will bless you, I will be with you, I will hear whatever you tell me, and you will have so many descendants. Just go back; I will watch over you, I will protect you. Now Hagar can go back in peace. It is very important to us that God promises what is in our future. Sometimes I and maybe all of you may have to go to a new place and start something new, and there is fear in our hearts. We dont know what the result is going to be. But Hagar has the promise from God: God has told her what is going to happen. In China, a lot of people fear death. If you ask anyone who is going to die whether they fear death, Im sure they will say yes. Why? Because they dont know what is going to happen after death. But if you ask a real Christian: Do you fear death or not? They will say: No. My grandma always says: I never fear death, and I have already pray about that. I hope one day, God will deliver me, and God will let me go to heaven to be with him forever more. And I ask him that please not let me be sick before dying so that people do not have to take care of me. I just pray that God will give me health, and then I can die while healthy. God answered her prayer. When she was 84 years old, she took the bus to my mothers place one day, and she died. She never feared death, because she had a promise from God. God promises that And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. (John 14:3)So Gods promise is really important for all of us, as it is for Hagar. Thats why Hagars problem was solved and Hagar was healed by God. She went back to Abraham and then gave birth to a boy. Dear brothers and sisters, from this story we learn that even if we sometimes sin against God, or even if we face so many differences, difficulties and trials, we know that God has a name: El Roi, the God who sees. He sees it all. There is no place, no family and no one that God doesnt know. So I want to encourage you as well as myself that despite the world and its problems that we face every day, our God is the God who sees, El Roi.How to experience Gods CareOur God is the God who sees and who is still watching over us. No matter who we are or where we are, He loves us. This is the truth. Then how can we experience His care? We may learn that from Hagar. We need to listen to Gods order and Gods will. We need to read the Bible, come to church and share the words with others through our service. We need to keep in touch with God through our prayers. We also need to turn back. Turning back is a good sign of repentance. This is the way that we can feel Gods care and presence.BibleIt is very simple; it begins with reading the Bible so as to know Gods words, with listening to the sermon and with communicating with other brothers and sisters.Yet I know there is still a problem that troubles some of us. As a pastor, sometimes I heard from a brother or a sister that they had had really good dreams the previous night; they hoped that I could explain to them what God was trying to say through these dreams. Some told me that God talked to them the previous night and asked me to explain Gods will to them. Then I had to confess that I didnt know. However I do know that God speaks to us through the Bible. I believe God can speak to us in other ways, but I am sure if God really wants to speak to you, He will let you know, but not the others, so you dont need others to tell you what Gods will for you is.  PrayersWe have to keep a conversation with our God-we have to pray. I believe that praying is powerful. Praying is powerful: if we do talk to our God, just as Hagar did when she told God her problems and her sins, God will let us know His will and guidance. Praying is powerful: I remember one day a schoolmate of mine from Nanjing Seminary shared with us his testimony. It was a very short prayer. He was on his way to preach in a church. Having no car, he chose to take the bus. It was a very cold day and the window of the bus was open. Taking into consideration that other passengers might still want to leave it that way, he hesitated whether he should close the window. So what could he do? He prayed. He prayed: Father in Heaven, I am cold; it is so cold. There were a father and his little boy sitting beside my schoolmate. A minute or two after the prayer, the little boy said to his father: Father, I am cold. And the father closed that window instantly. My schoolmates prayer was answered and his problem solved. That is a simple example and a short prayer, but it shows us that praying is powerful. We have to communicate with our God. We have to keep the conversation through our prayers.  Turning Back to GodIf we want to experience Gods care, we have to turn back to Him. We have to turn back. God told Hagar: Go back to your mistress and submit to her. This is the way that God heals us and takes care of us: He asks us to turn back.Let us turn back to our God, because we know arrogance is not what God wants in people. Thats also why God asked Hagar to be obedient. Dear brothers and sisters, turning back to God is what He wants us to do. Then we can experience His care and healing. I know there are a lot of people who, before becoming Christians, thought that they were good. I am a good person: I take care of others; I love others; I do my best to study; I do my best to take care of my family and to do my work. I am a good person. But right after we accept Jesus as our Savior, we realize that we are sinners and that we need to turn back to our God.Today I would like to challenge myself as well as all of us: there must be one thing that we need to turn away from so as to be back with our God. What is it? We should find out.Dear brothers and sisters, todays world is full of darkness, sorrows and disasters. We have to face them, but we are not alone, because our God watches over us and cares for us all the time; He is El Roi, the God who sees. Lets pray: Dear Lord, the God who sees, thank you. For you have let us known that no matter what happens in our lives and in this world, you are the God who sees. We know that you are our God who is still watching over us. Lord, we want to lift all of us into your hands, because you know all of us. You know our problems; you know our trials; you know all that happens in our lives. Please, strengthen us. Please, speak to us. We know that you healed Hagar. We know that you were with her and were her guidance. And today you will speak to all of us through your Holy Bible. You will also strengthen us and be our guidance. God, let us be strong in you; let us rely on you; let us focus on you. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. With strength and love in Jesus, summarized by Ray, Apple and Chong"

Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment. But when he, the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speaks only what he hears , and he will tell you what is yet to come.Good morning! A couple of weeks ago, I asked a group of Christians a question, what does come to your mind first when you hear the Holy Spirit? In other words, what will you think first when you hear the Holy Spirit? Counselor, thats good. So if that question I ask you, what else you will think: helper, that is right, power, ok, peace, wisdom, ok.When I ask that question, some people said tongue, some people said power, impersonal force, and some people said Charismatics, some people said gift. I think there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding of the Holy Spirit. Many times we ignore the work of the Holy Spirit, and some people are even scared to talk about the Holy Spirit. Let me share a little bit by my journey of Christian life. You know after becoming a Christian, first of all I got to know more about Jesus first. He lived without sin, he died on the cross for us and he rose again and conquered death; hes sent into the Heaven and he will come back to judge the living and the dead. And move on I got to know more about God, father in heaven He loves us, cares about us, hears and answers our prayers, but the third member of trinity the Holy Spirit, is the one I am a little bit slower to come to understand. I always believe He is the God, but I just dont know how to have a relationship with the Holy Spirit. I would have had easier time saying I love the Lord Jesus, but it would have been harder for me to say I love the Holy Spirit. In more recent time God helps me to understand more about Holy Spirit. He openes my eyes to see the value of the Holy Spirit, that is the area that I am still maturing and growing and I also want that for you. My desire is to honor God and may His name be glorified. The purpose of todays message is to clear up some misunderstandings of the Holy Spirit and hopefully you can invite the Holy Spirit, you can come to understand, embrace and walk with Holy Spirit. I hope todays message also can remind you that its not about you; its about the spirit God sent to you, because of that you are an amazing and powerful person, let us pray:Heavenly Father you are awesome God and I just want to praise you. Thank you for sending the Holy Spirit to us helping us and guiding us, Lord I ask you to help us to understand more about the Holy Spirit, I lift up this message into your hand, please guide me speak through me I pray in Jesus name, Amen. First of all, I want to talk about who is the Holy Spirit? You know weve been studying the Gospel of John, chapter by chapter. In John it records many important Jesus teaching, parables and also miracles Jesus did. Through the Gospel of John we get to know about Jesus; He is the Christ and came to save us, by believing in Him we can have eternal life. In chapter 13, Jesus predict His death and He told his disciples hes leaving; he is going away to die. Think about it, he told his disciples who had been around with him over three years on the earth, when they heard that, their hearts filled with grieve. In chapter 14 Jesus comforted them and said: John14:1-4 Do not let your heart be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me I am going there to prepare place for you.. I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going. After that Thomas one of his disciples asked John14: 5-6 Lord, we dont know where you are going, so how can we know the way? Jesus answered I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Here the disciple asked where you are going and how we can know the way and Jesus told them I am the way. In fact I am the only way; no one comes to the Father except through me. After that Jesus continued to encourage them, comfort them and told them the Counselor the Holy Spirit will come after his leaving.That is a little bit background for todays message and I hope that will help you to understand. Todays reading Scripture is John16:7 It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you. HYPERLINK ""http://english.hdchurch.org/uploads/allimg/110822/22520CW5-0.jpg"" \t ""_blank""1. The Holy Spirit is our Counselor. We all want the physical presence of Jesus; we want to see Jesus and every time when we have questions we can come to him, but Jesus here said I am going away for your good, I am going away and let the Holy Spirit come. You know if Jesus is here in human flesh and blood, he cannot be with all of us at all time. Paul in 1 Corinthian 6 said the Holy Spirit lives in the children of God and our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. That means the Holy Spirit lives inside of our body among the Christians. Isnt that amazing that the Holy Spirit lives inside of us! No matter where we go, he is with us and we are not alone. Hell come to help us, we are not alone. 2. The Holy Spirit is God.John14:16-18 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you foreverthe Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because they neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.The God Father will give us another Counselor to be with you forever! The word another means equality. When Jesus was saying here, he asked Father to send the Counselor, the one who comes will be just like me. Let me tell you what the Holy Spirit is not. The Holy Spirit is not emotional or warm feeling or some forces. The Holy Spirit is the third member of trinity, the God Father, the God Son and the God Holy Spirit.

The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth John16:13 says, when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.And John14:26 says, the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will sent in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I said to you.So the Holy Spirit is the spirit of truth, he guides us, knows all things and teaches us all things. I think the truth does not just stop here, not just knowing the right things, not just OK, I know that answer, the truth cannot stop there. We need to live it out with action and fruits. So Holy Spirit comes to guide us, to help us to know the truth, and gives us power to live it out. So we can know from here (mind), and live it out from here (heart). So we talk about that the Holy Spirit is our counselor. He is the God. He is the Spirit of truth. After that when we talk about what Holy Spirit does, I mean the work of Holy Spirit. When I study the passage, I realize there are so many and so many passages talking about the Holy Spirit from the first book of the Bible to talk about the Holy Spirit. If we can list all of them, here, there probably will be 48 hours sermon. But I know you probably didnt prepare for that. So I want to keep it short, keep it a short summary and help you to understand some of the work of Holy Spirit.3.1 Helping, guiding and teaching. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth, we talk about that, and he is the one who guides us, teaches us all things. You know, the Bible was written by men, led or inspired by the Holy Spirit. You know every time when we open the Bible, when we study or read the Bible, there are always something we couldnt understand. I dont know about you, I will immediately go find the Bible commentary or go to internet to search what does that mean, what is it trying to tell me, what is the meaning, what it says. But I learn that, the Bible was written by men led by the Holy Spirit, so I need to ask him to tell me instead of going to Bible commentary first. I will ask Holy Spirit. You are the Spirit of truth, please help me understand what it says, what are  you trying to tell me, and how can I apply into my daily life. And we can always pray that, and let him to speak to us instead of going to the Bible commentary first.Luke 12:11 says dont worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say, for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.I remember when I share the gospel with my family or my friends; they ask all kinds of questions. I felt, ho, no way I can answer that question. Its so hard I never thought about those questions. But you know what, when they ask question, I pray quietly in my heart, Holy Spirit, please work in their hearts, also give me the words to say. And how can I answer to help them to know you more, to guide them to know you. So we can always ask Holy Spirit, if we dont know how to say, you can ask Holy Spirit.Roman 8:26 says the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. Have you ever felt so weak sometimes? And dont know how to pray, what to pray. I know I have. Sometimes so much pressure, get too stressed, even some of the ministry work. I dont know how to share, I dont know how to lead, I dont know Lord, I just dont know, no way I can do this, so often and I realize, I rely on my own strength not Gods power, not rely on him. God he is the one in control, and he sends the Holy Spirit to help us, pray for us and help us. And I believe the Holy Spirit not just helps us for big things, but also believe he helps us in small things, little things. Let me share a story with you. I remember I shared my moms testimony before. My mom became a Christian two years ago. And last month, she visited us and she shared a story with me. I was so encouraged and touched. And she said you know I always have problem with my memory. My mom said, I put something in my house but I couldnt find it, I just search the whole house but couldnt find the things I want. Every time after that I pray God please help me. Please help me to find that. After the prayer, There already a few times she shared with me. And just some thought comes to her mind and tells her where exactly she put up things and then she can go there and find it. I believe God help us not just in big things. If you want to come to him and ask him for help, he wants to help you.

John 16:8 says when he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgmentYou know when we share the gospel with our family or friends, we always try to convince them, and always try to tell them what is right and what is wrong. After that we find that there is no way to convince that person. No way. And so many times we feel disappointed, you know what. Its our job to go and tell and share the gospel. The Holy Spirit is the one to work in peoples heart, convict their sin, helping them to realize their needs for righteousness.And I believe Holy Spirit helps us realize our sin before we are Christians but also after we become Christians. Let me give you an illustration and help you understand. You know sometimes the sins we take on just become a part of us. And our life is like a house with many rooms one by one. Holy spirit goes in, turns on the light. So we have the choice here. Whether we want to respond to him let him to show what he wants or we try to turn off the light.I remember the day I was baptized. And after baptism a pastor gave me a verse.  Roman 8:15 for you didnt receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fare, but you received the Spirit of Sonship. And by him we cry, Abba, Father. The spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are Gods children.Being a son or a daughter of God, the Creator of universe, that is the highest privilege we can ever have. Son or daughter of the creator of the universe, that is amazing! The term Abba is the enduring way to address the Farther. It means Daddy in todays language and we can come to Father and the Holy Spirit helps us to realize God loves us so deeply. He cares about us; He wants to give the very best to us. Brothers and sisters, the Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are Gods children. So by Him, we cry out Abba! Father!  3.3 Gifting. When we come to the point of Spiritual gift, Holy Spirit works in many ways. In 1Corinthians, it talks about all kinds of gifts and mentions there are speaking gifts like tongue, interpretation and prophecy and there are also serving gifts like administration, healing and also giving. God gives us different gifts and I believe God wants us to build our church, build up each other, we need to think about we use gifts to build church to build up brothers and sisters and people around us.  1Corinthians12:4-6 There are different kind of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men. Here we need to be cautious, and we cant seek the gift higher than seeking the relationship with God. If we only seek the gift or power, instead of seeking God Himself, we end up only focusing on ourselves. We dont want to live up particular person or gift, we want to live up God, and I heard too many times church is split by this issue that God is not glorified. I believe that if Spirit let, and God unify us, join us close. Another thing is we can have all kinds of gifts but the most important is love. Like Paul said in 1Corinthians without love, speaking tongues and understanding all mysteries and knowledge means nothing. Galatians 5:22-23but the fruit of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control I believe these are not just concepts. God want us to bear fruits. We can ask Holy Spirit to give us power to live it out to work through us to bless people around us.3.4. Transforming. Life changes through the Holy Spirit, like Christians, we can share so many stories about how God changes our life, so many things that life has been changed, I believe just rely on our own power we cant do it. Holy Spirit is like our personal trainer, encouraging us and also reminding us and disciplining us and helping us to get on the track. Most of time, you know, I realize I expect Him to change things, all things, all aspects of life and wants, but you know, most of time, He doesnt work that way. He changes things slowly and helps us and teaches us to trust in Him. We talk about that the Holy Spirit is our Counselor, the Holy Spirit is God, the Holy Spirit is the spirit of truth, coming to teach us, help us and guide us and convict our sins, and also give us gift and transform our life. So we have a choice whether we want to invite Him and welcome Him and walk with Him. I believe there are a few barriers to walk with Holy Spirit. 1. Doubt. Can the Holy Spirit really help me and guide me? Thats our doubt. Luke 11:9-10 Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives Maybe some people maybe not me, who seeks will find, knocks and the door will be open. Here, it says for everyone who asks receives, not just for a particular person.2. Fear. If I ask the Holy Spirit whether there are some terrible things to me? Or something I dont want to do? Thats our fear. Sometimes, our enemies lie to us, you are not qualified. Thats the enemies lie, and we always fear to pray or to come to the Holy Spirit. 3. Noise. I believe living in this city, everyone is so busy with life, job or study. There are so many things distracting our mind and our attention: television, radio, internet, micro-blog, mobile-phone, clothing, iPad. All kinds of things distract our mind and attention and we find our life become so busy and so noisy that we have not sat down along with God for a long time. Im not telling you what God would have you do with life but the most important thing is I dont want you to miss the point of Gods plan for you. Spending time alone with God, if thats the case, you may sit aside to spend some time with God quietly. Speak to Him, listen to Him, read His words and ask Him to guide you.

Sometimes, when we live in this world, we face a lot of troubles. And sometimes we lose our energy; we feel that we are very weak. Sometimes we feel that we are losing hope. The following Chinese song that we are going to sing, reminds us all of our hope lies in Jesus Christ alone. He is our peace, all of our joy lies in Jesus Christ alone. He lives with us for ever more. We declare that the one who is with us is greater than the one in this world. We are not of this world; we belong to Jesus, the King. He lives in us. We are strengthened in him. He conquered all of our enemies. Our Lord is our portion and our victory. Let's sing this Chinese song  Full of Power together. Praise the Lord, because of him, we have the power; because of him, we have the strength to live. Sermon: Good morning, I greet you in the name of our Lord from the church that I serve just a few miles away from here, Beijing International Christian Fellowship over Zhongguancun, and I am happy that my wife and two of our three sons and our daughter-in-law are with us today and it is a great joy to be with you. Let's hear the Word of the Lord from John chapter 17 verse 1:Scripture Reading: John 17Jesus Prays for Himself 1 After Jesus said this, he looked towards heaven and prayed:   Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.    2 For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.    3 Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.    4 I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.    5 And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.   Jesus Prays for His Disciples 6 I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.    7 Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.    8 For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.    9 I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.    10 All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them.    11 I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name the name you gave me so that they may be one as we are one.    12 While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.    13 I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.    14 I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.    15 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.    16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.    17 Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.    18 As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.    19 For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.   Jesus Prays for All Believers 20 My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,    21 that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.    22 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one:    23 I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.    24 Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.    25 Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me.    26 I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.Shall we pray? Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for this great prayer that you prayed as you were here on earth. And we believe now that you are here with us as we gathered in you name, and we pray that as we turn to this wonderful section of Holy Scripture, you will open our hearts and minds and we might hear your voice and follow in the way you want us to go. We pray in your name. Amen.INTRODUCTION:This is an extremely sad moment in the narrative of the gospel of John, because for three years Jesus had been with His disciples for 24/7. They had laughed together, they had cried together, they had gone through every circumstance of life together. And in all things they knew that Jesus was with them. And now, they are told, that he is going away. The treasurer has betrayed Him. The strong leader, Peter, has denied Him. And now they hear, Jesus says in John 16:32 that, A time is coming, and has come, when you will be scattered, ...You will leave me all alone...  And so this terrible news, that Jesus is going to suffer, that they also would suffer. And in fact, there must have been something very wonderful about this very prayer, because those who heard these words remained strong and by His grace remained together. Usually, when somebody says let us pray , you finally say well, the sermon is over. But here is a prayer, where we need to give attention, because this is exactly where the Lord has His message for us. In verses one through eight, you notice, He prays for Himself. In verses nine through nineteen He prays for His disciples. And in verses twenty through twenty-six He prays for the Church. And so this morning, almost this afternoon, I want us to consider, first of all, the Revelation of His Glory. And secondly, Redemption by His Grace. And thirdly, Relationship of Gladness. 1. Revelation of Glory First of all - Revelation of His Glory. I think, that really is the main idea that we get from this prayer. Notice in verse one, Jesus, having finished His work now says, Father, ...Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.. In fact, it is almost like we are eavesdropping into a very private moment between the Father and His son, where the Son pours out His heart to His Father. In fact, it is the most sacred moment in all of the four gospels. It is almost like a son, far away from home, gets on Skype and says, Dad, I am having a tough time. I am ready to come home. Indeed Jesus calls upon the Father. We have in the Bible twenty one prayers offered by Jesus. And all of them begin the same way: Abba, Father, with that intimate relationship between the Father and the Son. In fact, if you study the Old Testament you will never see a prayer that begins Abba, Father, because it is only Jesus who tells us how we might come into that deep relationship with Him. And what Jesus would talk about to His Father is the theme of glory. In fact, the Psalmer says: Who is the King of Glory, the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. The first reference in the Bible to glory is in the book of Exodus. Where God Himself says: I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. (Exodus 14:4) Glory is the fullness of God. It's everything He is in all of His power and might. It is everything that we can see about God, and everything we cannot see about God. His awesome holiness and righteousness and truth and justice, it is the fullness of God. And in fact, because of His glory, His enemies were destroyed in the Red Sea. Because of His glory His people were delivered through the Red Sea. And as Jesus has come, you notice, He has given up for a season His glory. John 17:5 And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.1.1 Given UpIndeed, in order to become a model man, and live a humble life of suffering upon the earth, Jesus set aside for a season His glory. Incarnation meant for Jesus humiliation as He volunteered to be a servant. And so indeed, if we ever would see the full glory of God before us, we would fall dead like the armies of Pharaoh. Paul explains it to the Philippians that Jesus, in the very nature of God has made Himself nothing during the season upon the earth as a servant. Isaiah says that He has no beauty or majesty to attract us to Him, nothing in His appearance that we should desire Him. 1.2 Given to SomeBut you realise that in the gospel of John, this glory is given to some. In fact, the first miracle is in chapter 2, when He turned water in wine, and John says, He thus revealed His glory, and His disciples put their faith in Him. And so for that narrow second, God revealed the glimpse of His glory for the disciples to see the wonder and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ. And so, that is why John begins the gospel, saying, John 1:14 We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. 1.3 Given BackAnd now in this prayer, Jesus is anticipating that glory to be given back to Him. John 17:1, Father, the time has come, glorify your Son that your Son may glorify you. John 17:5, And now Father, glorify me in your presence. And so that pre-incarnate glory that He had with the Father and the Spirit before the world began is now going to be restored to the ascended, exalted and victorious Son. And we know that this is a prayer that God answered. The same John, who wrote this gospel, also wrote the book of Revelation. And there in the first chapter of Revelation, John sees the answered prayer, John sees the overwhelming glory of the Son of Man, exalted, risen from the dead. Indeed, the very far angles of His hair shine the glory of the risen God. The writer of Hebrews says, Jesus lives for ever Therefore, He is able to save completely those who come to God through Him, and He always lives to intercede for them. What an amazing thought, Jesus Christ is alive now! And He is praying for us right now! And indeed, the very prayer that we read from John 17 echoes the truth of His reality. John 17 is the longest prayer of Jesus, therefore, it is going to be the longest sermon you will ever hear this morning (that is a joke). Not only long in many verses, but it is long in its impact that even now, two thousand years later, as far away as Beijing, here we are, gathered together to think and to wonder about the prayer of our Lord. And so, Jesus has been given glory, and He prays for us, John 17:20, I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message. And so that even then, two thousand years ago, as Jesus prayed to His Father, He was also praying for you, and praying for me. An amazing thought! 1.4 Given to UsAnd so, that glory is also given to us. John 17:10, Glory has come to me through themJohn 17:22, I have given them the glory that you gave me. John 17:24, Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory. Is not that amazing? I do not know if you can wrap your head around the idea. I do not know if I can wrap my head. How can a sinful vessel, like me, be filled with the glory of God? But that is what He says. He says that, in fact, the very reason that we are gathered is to know Him and His glory. When we worked in Africa, one pastor said, To glorify God is to make God big in the eyes of others! And indeed, that is a great description of the glory of God. God is awesome, and that is what it means to be glorious. And Jesus says in John 16:33, John 16:33 I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace in the world. In the world, you will have trouble, but take heart, I have overcome the world. What is interesting about this chapter is that 19 times in John 17, Jesus uses the word world, and it seems that no matter he is thinking about His Father, He is very conscious that we are here, in this world. The world hates the disciples, John 17:14, The world has hated them for they are not of the world. The world hates Jesus. John 17:15 If the world hates you, keep in mind, it has hated me first. But amazingly, in this world that hates God, God, John 3:16, loves this world and gives His son. That is the glory of God, isnt it? That is the glory of God that we are not to escape from this world, but we remain right here. That is the glory of God that He gives us power in this world that we might serve Him even if we are hated. That is the glory of God that we might respond in love and forgiveness even if the world hates us. Indeed, the Psalmer says, Psalm 3:1-3 O Lord, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me! Many are saying of me, God will not deliver him. But you are a shield around me, o Lord; you bestow glory on me and lift up my head. And so we see this revelation of glory.2. Redemption of GraceWe secondly see the Redemption by Grace. You might say, Why does Jesus pray at this moment of His ministry? The simple answer is He needs it, just like we need it. 2.1 Sanctified ChristIn fact, He said in John 16:32, You will leave me all alone, but I am not alone, for my Father is with me. And so we see here a sanctified Christ. He says in verse 1, Father, the time has come. It is very interesting in our study of the gospel of John, perhaps you have seen this, every time you find the word time, it is a reference to His death. It starts in chapter 2 at the miracle of Canaan where Mary wants Him to make that water into wine, and He turns to His mother, and says, My time has not yet come. It is almost like Him saying, Hey mom, lets get on the same page here. Or in chapter 7 where He says, No one laid a hand on Him because His time has not yet come. Or in chapter 8 where No one seized Him because His time has not yet come. But it is clear by the time you get to chapter 12 when Jesus says, John 12:23  The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.  27 Now my heart is troubled. What can I say? 28 Father, save me from this hour? No, it is for this very reason that I came to this hour. Father, glorify your name. And then a voice came from heaven, I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.  33 And He said this to show the kind of death He was going to die. And so, when our Lord says now the time has come, He is speaking about the cross, He is anticipating the moment that He will suffer for you and for me. And in that way, He is being sanctified. What is sanctify? Well, it simply means to be set apart. The bus you rode on this morning became sanctified when you, His servant, went inside. The comb you used for your hair this morning became sanctified when you, His servant, touched it upon your head. This auditorium became sanctified when we, the people of God, came inside to worship Him. And so Jesus similarly says, I now set myself apart for the work of the cross I came to die. John 17:19 Jesus says, For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.""In fact, when Judas, the betrayer, in chapter 13, goes out, Jesus says, John 13:31-32 Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will glorify the Son in Himself, and will glorify him at once.Isnt it awesome?! The way John reveals the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ through the work of the cross. Jesus will be glorified, why? Because He is going to die for His people.From the human point of view, Calvary was a revolting display of mans sin; but from the divine point of view, the cross revealed and magnified the grace and glory of God.        Warren WiersbeSanctified ChristiansSo in Christ, we are called to be also sanctified. John 17:2-3: For you granted him authority over all propel that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.Jesus is saying He rules over all things. Jesus has come to redeem His chosen people and the amazing thing is that we have been invited to know this Christ; that we are invited to be set apart from the world that does not know Him, to be set apart from the world that hates Him, and enter in now to the love of God. Eternal life is not so much everlasting life as the knowledge of the everlasting one. Reality: In the WorldAnd we need to know this reality right here right now in the world.John 17:15: My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.I have news for you. Even if you want to follow Jesus Christ, it is not a guarantee that it is going to take away all your problems. You might still have pimples; you might still have a pot belly (look at me); you still might have all kinds of problems in this world of trials, and tests, and temptations In fact, Jesus says, In this world you will have trouble. (John 16.33 NIV) You might not get a CD of your band; you might not get your mansion on earth, but the promise of the gospel is in this world you will know Him and His protection. Jesus says to the disciples: Matthew 10:16 I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. That is a pretty scary verse, isnt it? I mean the wolves can rip your throat right open, and Jesus is saying, I meet these dangerous animals, I am with you. Somebody has said, We are clearly not to isolate ourselves from the world. But we must never forget that the world is a dangerous place. The only safeguard is the provision of the Shepherd that He has made to be with us, and in us. (Ray Steadman) And so in this world our identity is not of this world.Identity: Not of the worldJohn17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. John 8:23 Remember back in chapter 8, Jesus told the unbelieving religious leaders, You are from below; but I am from above. You are of this world; but I am not of this world.And now Jesus is inviting us to also not be of this world. You say, How do you do that? Well, Jesus of course is a real man, He was born, He lived, He cried, He suffered, He laughed, He died, even if we will, He went through all these experiences of life. And yet He was not from this world.Sanctification is not instantly completed in us on the first day, but that we make progress in it through the whole course of our life, till at length, God, having taken away from us the garment of the flesh, fills us with His righteousness.    John Calvin2.2.3   Responsibility: Sent into the WorldSo we are in this world but we are not of it, our identity has been changed. Therefore we have also in this world a responsibility, that is we are now sent into the world. And you might say,Well, if the world is going to hell, why does Jesus leave us here? Well, that is the very answer to the question: we are left in the world with a responsibility of His servants, of His ambassadors, of His witnesses, that we might make Him known to the world that is dying without Him. John 17:18: As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.   We are going to a better place. But we are here now to point others to the way. John 17:17, Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.So if you want to know Christ even today; you need to know His Word; you need to open the scriptures, because it is in sacred scripture that you will meet a sanctified Christ.  3. Relationship of GladnessAnd finally, the third point is our relationship that we have now in Christ with gladness. And I pray that even this morning we are a contented people. ContentmentJesus says in verse 4, I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.You realize that one of the great themes of the gospel of John is the finished work of Christ that he has done everything necessary for our salvation, and so when they found Jesus with the Samaritan woman as they came back with Jiaozi that they thought they would eat with him, He said,John 4:34 My food is to do the will of Him who sent me and to finish His work. You remember on the cross in John chapter 19 as Jesus cried out dramatically, It is finished. (John 19:30 NIV) That the work of salvation that He came to do has now completed by His death. Indeed, somebody has said and this is not very flattering, but it is absolutely true: the only thing we add to the plan of salvation is the sin to make it necessary (Eric Alexander). There is nothing we can do. Indeed, if we try to do something, to save ourselves; we will only make ourselves more lost before the Holy God. God in Christ has done everything necessary for our salvation, He has finished the work, He completed the work of the gospel, and so we praise now His life is complete because His work on earth is complete. Now you might say, How could His life be complete? He never made it to Alexandria; He never got to Rome; in fact, He never even came to Beijing! How could His life be complete? Well, even in that limited geography in which He lived, He was complete! He never got married; He never fathered a child; He never grew to old age; He never saw His grandchildren! But He was complete. Because He has finished the work that the Father had given Him to do. The Psalmer says, and I think Jesus would say, Psalm 31:14- 15 I trust in you, O LORD; you are my God. My times are in your hands.  O Lord God, when you give your servants to endeavor any great matter, grant us also to know that it is not the beginning, but the continuing of the same to the end, until it be thoroughly finished, which yields true glory; through him who for the finishing of your work, laid down his life, our redeemer, Jesus Christ.-Sir Walter RaleighYou have made us for yourself and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.   -AugustineYou see, without God, we are empty. Without God, we are unfulfilled. But Christ, who has done and finished the work of God, He is complete. There is nothing lacking in Him, because He has finished the work. Somebody has asked:Q: What is the chief end (purpose) of man?A: Mans chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever. Westminster Shorter CatechismThats why we are here. We are given the privilege, that even here we will know the contentment of His glory and His joy. CelebrationTherefore we are called to celebrate. No, we are not to ESCAPE from the trouble of this Life & Reality, but we are called even IN this life to know God.   John 17:13 ""I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. Is that an awesome phrase: the full measure of my joy within them? Did you have that joy this morning? Do you know the fullness of Christ in your life? Thats why He came! Nothing in this world, none of those computers that you find across the street, not even an iPad, will give you as much joy as knowing Jesus Christ of having the fullness of God in your life. And so He asked his disciples to live in that joy. Remember when they were sent on mission in Luke 10, they came back and said: Luke 10:17 ""Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name."" Jesus said:John 17:22-23 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one: I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. I dont have the metaphysical ability to understand how one God can reveal Himself in three persons, or how one God has put Himself in over 1 billion of his followers. I dont know how He did that. But that is exactly what this passage says. Thats exactly what it tells us: that we are His own.Fellowship is not only defined in terms of what we share in together. It also involves what we share out togethera community in which Christians actually share their thoughts and lives with one another.               -James Boice And so the challenge for us who know Him: it is not enough just sitting here, during an hour or so of worship on Sunday mornings. We need to be together even throughout the week. We need to grow together in the depth of fellowship of knowing Him. So we are called into both an exclusive and an inclusive relationship:Exclusive relationship: Only Jesus can take us to Heaven,Inclusive relationship: Only Jesus connects us on Earth. The entire world is welcomed to come and know Him by Faith. And so obviously, we have our differences in passports, faces, figures, preferences, personalities-all quite different; but we find our unity in Jesus Christ who has made us one!The presence of Jesus with His diverse disciples was the unifying factor  then and now. No Jesus, no unity.                                             -Yours TrulyCompassionWith compassion, Jesus prays:John 17:25-26 ""Righteous Father, though the world does not know you..."" Do you have that heart of Jesus? Have you felt that heaviness? Oh, Lord! The world does not know you. Has it burned upon you the reality of how many millions do not know the Lord Jesus Christ? As Jesus is about to resume that full state of glory with His Father, He cant forget the reality of a lost world. He is burdened for their salvation. Jesus was surrounded by many religions; but no Roman, no Egyptian, no Babylonian, perhaps not even any Pharisee or Sadducee really know God in the way that Christ had come to reveal Him. And so now having prayed for the world, Christ will go to the cross, and purchase the world with His blood. John 13:1 Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love.  You know it means the cross. You know it means He is going to be nailed there for you and for me to bear upon Himself the fullness of our guilt, sin and shame, and to pay in His body the punishment that we should pay. He was giving up His life so that we might live. Thats the love of God, thats the gospel of Christ, thats exactly why He came. And I pray that love for which He prayed we would know in a deeper and more glorious way so that it will change your life; so you will enter into His Salvation; so you will know Him, not just as a strange God far away, but as a Savior who has come to give his life for you. And having come to know Him, you therefore enter into a service; and you, like Him, leave the comforts of all that you know and are familiar with and come to know and follow Him, and give your service to the Christ who gives you His salvation. What marvelous love the Father has extended to us! Just look at it  we're called children of God! That's what we really are.Lets pray:Lord Jesus Christ, we worship you this morning, the glorious Son of God, who came to the world, who revealed your humility and servant heart to us, who revealed to us the fullness of glory even upon the cross, as you there suffered in our place as our Savior and our King. We marvel this morning at this prayer that you uttered to your Father just hours before the cross: the prayer of sweet communion with the Son and the Father; the prayer of power, asking that those who would believe in you through the proclamation of the gospel would know the joy in which youve come to give. In fact, even this morning as weve gathered together to worship you, we are revealing the very answer to this prayer, the power of the risen Christ, and the wonder of gospel that He has given. Lord, help us to know you as our Savior and our God. I pray this morning for anyone here who doesnt yet know you that you by your Holy Spirit will open their hearts and minds and reveal your glory to them. And I pray, Father, for those of us who do know you that we will again commit ourselves to the work of your service. You have loved us to the end. Now we may give ourselves with abandon to the work of Kingdom of God. Lord, build your Kingdom in Beijing. Lord, build your Church in China. Lord, reveal your glory to the ends of earth. We pray in Jesus Name. Amen!With love and strength in Jesus Christ, summarized by Marjo, Franz, Amy, Katherine and Chong.Mark BlairThe Lords Prayer08/28/2011Haidian Christian Church PAGE 11 of  NUMPAGES 11"

It is so good to be with you guys again. Amazing Grace is one of my favorite songs. Every time I sang the song, it seemed to me that the tears just came down from my eyes, all the way through the cheek, down to here (his chin). Amazing Grace is one of the songs that I sang the most last month when I was in Shenzhen. Brothers and sisters, before I focus the next 20 minutes on the preaching that Ive prepared, I would like to share a testimony which happened to me, in which I was involved when I was in Shenzhen as a chaplain to the University Student Games, to the athletes who were involved in these games. Brothers and sisters, as you know, Chinese soccer has been so poor. You know, China is a country with a population of one billion people, such a big country! Our soccer team could be beaten by Vietnamese soccer team, our team could be beaten by Myanmar soccer team. It is a shame. And our womens soccer team has not been any better than our mens soccer team. It is a shame. Brothers and sisters, let me tell you, in the last University Student Games, our student women's soccer team won the championship. Brothers and sisters, let me ask you: how and why they can do that? They won the championship!Can you tell me the answers? Let me tell you, it is very simple; they came to the church to pray there. In this student athlete village, there was a small chapel, and I was one of the chaplains there. Before they played the Brazilian soccer team, a tough team as you know, these soccer players - young Chinese girls came to the church to pray and to worship the same Amazing Grace together with me and with other Christian brothers and sisters. We had a wonderful fellowship. We encouraged each other. And on the following night, they beat the Brazilian team. And one day before they played Japan for the champion, they came to the church to pray again. We worshipped and sang songs and praises to our Lord. Before they left, I asked one of the soccer players, a young girl, how the game would go. She said, Japanese was so good these days. They just won the world champion for womens soccer. And we do not know how the thing would go. I just did not know why I said that: With God, nothing is impossible. That is what I said to the lady. And on the following day, Japanese soccer team was beaten very badly. We won the champion. So with God, nothing is impossible. So nice you come to His presence to praise His name. God will work wonders for us. So brothers and sisters, let us all give praise to our Heavenly Father. We will put our trust in Jesus Christ, son of God. In the last month, I spent almost the whole month in Shenzhen. When I was there, I met two persons. Both of them used to work at Haidian Church, they went to Shenzhen for work. And I talked to one of them about how things have been going with him. And he said, I have been coming to church every Sunday. And it is so nice that church has Bible study and fellowship that I always go. And my heart feels on fire all the time. I am always so excited by what I have heard in the church. So I go to church almost every Sunday. Then I talked to the other man, I asked him, How are things going with you? He said, Ive been busy. When I first arrived here, I came to church to worship. So nice that the church has a fellowship, so I came. But these days, because I have a busy job, I have to take care of my work, so I cannot come to church as often as I used to be. These days, probably, I came to church once or twice a month, or sometimes, a couple of times half a year.  Then I asked him, Are you still walking with Jesus? Is Jesus still walking with you? Because of your busy work, because of the busy schedule, because of the pressure, because of the relationship, you have lost Jesus! Later I just encouraged him to come back to Jerusalem to find Jesus.And this reminds me of the story we just read to you. The Bible tells us in Luke 2:41 Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.Every year, what did Jesus parents go to Jerusalem for? For the Lord, for God, for praising the Father, for the Heavenly Father, or the Feast of Passover. When they finished all of these, they were on their way home. They were not aware Jesus was not with them. They thought Jesus was with them. But in fact Jesus was not in their company. They lost Jesus. And how and why they lost Jesus? Can you imagine the parents went to the Summer Palace to have fun, when they went home, they were not aware that their only son had got lost? Can you imagine that? No, you cant. You must pay attention to your son all the time. You must watch him all the time. You must have told him, Never again get off from my sight! How and why the parents lost their son? They thought Jesus might be with the relatives or friends of them. So they travelled on for the whole day, but they didnt find him by the end of the day. So they immediately went back to Jerusalem to find Him. Brothers and sisters, if you lose Jesus, I encourage you to go back to Jerusalem to find Him. But do not find Him in the super-market, do not find Him in the university, do not find Him in the literature and book, do not find Him in philosophy, or in athlete, but find Him in the temple of the court, find Him among brothers and sisters, find Him in the church, find Him in the fellowship of Christians. That is where you should go. Otherwise, the Bible tells us, it took the parents three days to find Jesus, three days! Was Jerusalem as big as Beijing? No, if you walk from the west side to the east side, it might take you probably half an hour. Walk, I do not mean by car, I mean you walk on your foot. So Jerusalem was not big, but how it took them three days to find Jesus? Because they did not know that Jesus was in the temple, they did not have that hunch in their heart. They thought: wow, Jesus was 12 years old, a naughty boy, He might be having fun, do some fishing in the river or chasing sheep on the pasture. That was their thought. But brother and sisters, never look for Jesus in the literature, in the university, in the book. But coming to the church to find Him, coming to find Him in Christian fellowship, because it is where we praise God and with fellowship we pray to the Lord, because He is the one always worthy to be praised and also He is the one who always answers our prayer, and makes our prayer come true,. But how the parents lost their son? How could we lose our faith? How could we lose Jesus - the Son of God, our Lord? It says the parents went to Jerusalem every year for the Feast of Passover. What is a feast? A feast is a combination of big festival, banquet, dancing, singing and all of these kinds of funs involved in it. So they went to Jerusalem not because they were called by the Lord, not because they were called, motivated, touched, pushed by the Holy Spirit of God, but because it was a holiday there, because it was a feast happening there. So they must go there every year, because it was a part of the routine. Brother and sisters, these days, you might go to Carrefour or other big markets, as soon as you walk into the shopping mall, you will be filled with moon cakes, because it is time to celebrate the so-called Mid-Autumn Festival, most people buy moon cakes, but they do not eat them, they give them to others as a kind of gift. But I sometimes eat, even though it tastes terrible. So you see, when Mid-Autumn Festival is coming, I go to Carrefour to buy a pack of moon cake, sometimes I buy more. Actually, last week I bought a lot, and gave them to some of the volunteers of the Church as a heart of thanksgiving expressed to them. That was what I did last week. I believe almost everybody, in the next week, must go, before this festival is here, to buy moon cakes there, because the time is to come, we must do that. So Jesus father and mother, Joseph and Mary, every year, they went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover as a routine, as something part of their life. They should do it because of the custom requiring them to do it, it is time to do it. When Dragon Boat Festival comes, we always go to the market to buy the gluten (sticky) rice dumplings, because it is time for us to eat that kind of awful thing, because it is time to go to the supermarket to buy those kinds of awful thing, because it is time for the parents of Jesus to go to the Jerusalem. It is a part of their day, their life, they should do it. They went there not because they were motivated, touched, moved or urged by the Holy Spirit of God. If your heart is not moved, touched and motivated by the Holy Spirit, when you come to church, well, the music there is great. Well, I have friends there. I want to go to the church to see if it is possible for me to find a friend, a life partner, because there are a lot of young girls and a lot of young boys there. That might be your purpose. But if you go to church with that kind of purpose, you lose the Son, you lose Jesus Christ, and you lose your faith. Brothers and sisters, you might have come to church over a couple of years, or even over ten years, you have already known almost everything of this church. You know the pastors, you know all the brothers and sisters in the church, and this is not new, nothing is exciting you anymore. You may want to stop coming to church as often as you used to be. It is time, it is a warning, it is the sign that you are losing Jesus. In verse 42, it talks continuously, When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom. You see the father and mother of Jesus Christ went up to Jerusalem not because they were called to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover, but because the custom required them to do it. The law of Israel, the law of the Rabbis, the law of Pentateuch, the law of temple required them to fulfill this kind of duty. Brothers and sisters, do you come to the church because you think you have this duty and you have to fulfill it? If you do not come to the church with a heart of happiness, if you do not come to the church with a heart that is connected very closely with Jesus Christ, then you are losing Jesus, you lose your faith.In 1984, I went to the seminary, and one of the questions we asked each other when we first met was that, How did you end up here? How you are here? That is one of the questions we exchanged, we asked each other all the time, some of my classmates said, My father was so sick, and he was completely healed by GOD, so that is why I want to contribute, commit the remaining time of my life to the Lord, to praise the name of the Lord and to be His servant. That is some of the answers that we got all the time. Then, there are other people, who said, Well, I do not want to be here, but you see, my grandfather was a pastor for 30 years, and he still goes to church these days, even though he is not a pastor in church anymore. He wants me to take up this job. My father, even though he was not a faithful Christian, he came to church probably once every other month, and he was not against the idea that I came to the seminary, and a few months ago, I took the entry exam for university. I failed by just a few points, and my grandpa said why dont you take an exam for seminary? I asked myself, well, if I graduate from seminary, I can still get a job, I can work, I can get some money to support my family, even though the salary is not as big as from a secular job, but still I can make a living, so that is why I am here.Brothers and sisters, this person came to the seminary because his grandpa asked him to do so, this person come to the seminary because he wanted to make a living, this person came to the church because even though he is not able to make a decent living but still can make bowls of wheat. Being required by grandpa, or forced to do so, having to do so because of the social pressure, make a living, and these students eventually dropped out of school. And we praise the Lord that this kind of person dropped out of school, and he lost Jesus Christ. The parents of Jesus Christ, they went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover, as a routine, part of their daily life. They went to Jerusalem when Jesus was 12 years old, because when the young boy was 12 years old, it was a time for Him to go through this kind of maturity celebration. So Passover certainly is a symbol if a young boy participates in it for this young boy to become mature from that moment on. Because of this, they were not called to go to Jerusalem, they lost Jesus. Are you, brothers and sisters, aware of the fact, of the possibility that you are losing Jesus? Do not be afraid, if you are losing, wake up! The sermon today serves as a wakeup call for you to wake up. To rethink about our faith - if our faith is weak, are we sleeping in our faith?If you are losing Jesus, come back to the fellowship. If you are losing Jesus, come back to the prayer meeting. If you are losing Jesus, come back to brothers and sisters who have strong faith in the Lord, for He answers prayers all the time and He will strengthen you, He will empower you, and He will walk with you. Amen. With love and strength in Jesus Christ, summarized by Linda, Katherine, Jane, Ray and FranzPastor WuAre you walking with Jesus?09/04/2011Haidian Christian Church PAGE 5 of  NUMPAGES 5"

On the other side there was a garden, and he and his disciples went into it. 2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. 3 So Judas came to the garden, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons. 4 Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, Who is it you want? 5 Jesus of Nazareth, they replied. I am he, Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) 6 When Jesus said, I am he, they drew back and fell to the ground. 7 Again he asked them, Who is it you want? Jesus of Nazareth, they said. 8 Jesus answered, I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, then let these men go.9 This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: I have not lost one of those you gave me. 10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priests servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servants name was Malchus.) 11 Jesus commanded Peter, Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me? 12 Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him13 and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. 14 Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people. The Cup or the SwordLets open with prayer:Father, you are the Holy Lord, God Almighty, and there is no other name given to us under Heaven but the sweet, precious , marvelous and matchless name of your Son Jesus, by whom we can be saved. Father, come today through your Holy Spirit to purify our hearts, our minds and our lives so that we can receive the fullness of your treasures that you have prepared for us in your Word. Speak to us, O Holy God. You are sovereign, you are God, there is no other besides you and so we stand in awe of our risen Savior, Jesus Christ. We pray in His name and for His fame. Amen.INTRODUCTIONGood morning everyone, I wish you a happy Mid-Autumn Festival and a happy resurrection day. That is why we come every Sunday to celebrate the resurrected, powerful, glorious, all-majestic and beautiful Lord Jesus.Today is also a special day. In America, it marks the tenth anniversary of 9/11 attacks. According to the headlines in the newspaper, it was a black day, a black hour; it was the day the world changed. We go through hours as dark as those of 9/11 in our own lives. For some of you, it might involve a family issue, a friendship issue, or a financial issue. Some even feels that there is no end to such dark hours-they seem to extend into a dark year or many dark years, where all is hopeless.SERMONIn Chapter 18, we experience the darkest hours of Jesus Christ. In fact we are in the darkest hours of history- the time when God the Son would die, when God the Son would be separated for the first time ever from His Father. We would hear the cry: My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? It is indeed a dark hour.In Chapter 17 we had the revelation of glory, the redemption of grace and the relationship of gladness. It was the Lords Prayer. But Chapter 18 can be divided into the following four parts: 1-11 Judass Betrayal12-24 Jews Trials25-27 Peters Denials28-40 Pilates TrialsIt is a journey from Gethsemane where Jesus agonized in prayer and drops of sweat like blood fell. And its a journey to Golgotha where Pilate sat on the judgment seat to judge the Judge of the world.How dare he sit to judge the Judge of the world!Today we will focus on the first fourteen verses, which can be divided into three sections:1-3 The Cohort4-9 The Christ10-14 The Cup1 CohortSo lets dive into the first section and see what God has prepared for us in the cohort. Maybe you are wondering what a cohort is. You will find out.1.1 John 18:1Verse 1 begins after Jesus finished praying. When Jesus prayed, He prayed for Himself, for His disciples and for the church, which are us, the future believers. This prayer ends with Chapter 17. Jesus says: Father, I have made you known to them. I wanted you to know them and they too know you, so that your love, your love for me, will be in them and that we will be one. He was praying so that we will experience the fullness of Gods love and the communion with Jesus-the communion for which we were created. After such a precious prayer, Jesus said to His disciples: Let us go. They crossed the Kidron Valley, which is a little brook. It was possible that as they crossed the brook they saw blood. Why was that? According to the historian Josephus, a Jewish historian, over 2,000,000 Jews came to the Passover with their lambs and over 250,000 lambs were slain at that Passover when Jesus died. The blood of those lambs would have flowed from the temple mount into the Kidron Brook. It is most likely that as Jesus crossed the brook, He looked down and saw the water and the blood, which seemed a foreshadow of what was to happen: His blood would be shed and His side would be pierced, where water and blood would pour out. As He crossed the brook He had a destination in mind: the olive grove. We learn from the other Gospels that the olive grove was called the Garden of Gethsemane, which means olive press, the press upon which the olives would be placed upon and crushed to produce the olive oil. This is the same garden where the Son of Man, the man of sorrows, would too be crushed. He too would agonize; He too would bleed; He too would, willingly and voluntarily, be crushed for you, for me and for us. The Garden of Gethsemane reminds us of another garden, a very famous garden-the Garden of Eden, where it all began in Genesis, where the first man Adam rebelled. But in Gethsemane the last Adam surrendered. In Eden the first Adam disobeyed while in Gethsemane the last Adam obeyed. Through the first Adam sin came; and through the last Adam, our Lord Jesus Christ, sin was dealt with. In Eden man fell while in Gethsemane Jesus Christ knelt down and prayed for you and me. Gethsemane is a beautiful garden, and it is a theme that will reappear in Revelation where we will have another garden, a radiant garden. I have talked about that on a previous occasion. It will be a magnificent garden with a river and a tree. I cannot wait for you and me to be in that garden. God is good.1.2 John 18:2Gethsemane was a place for prayer, fellowship and friendship. It was a place where Jesus and His disciples spent time together long and often. We have places that are special to us too, be it a prayer site or a quiet retreat. Jesus was in Gethsemane, but so was Judas the traitor. Judas had walked, talked and spent three years sharing bread with Jesus. Judas also shouldered an important role as he was in charge of the money. What is more, Judas was a man whom Jesus loved. Now Judas as a traitor set his foot into the special place of intimate friendship and love, bringing on his tail a murderous mob. It is in this place that Judas kissed Jesus whom he had betrayed. Jesus observed: Is this how you would betray the Son of Man, by a kiss? This is a warning for us: without your heart, it could be dangerous when you are in the proximity to rituals, to church or to Jesus; but I know that it is not the case with any of you, because as I have watched you worship here today, I know that you have come to worship and express you love to the Holy and Anointed One, Jesus Christ- and He knows you.1.3 John 18:3Judas came with a cohort, which is a group of approximately 600 or 1,000 Roman soldiers. This small army joined forces with the temple priests, carrying an array of weapons along with all those lanterns and torches on such a full-moon night as a Passover night, with the sole purpose of arresting an unarmed man and his friends who were praying in a garden. They brought with them lanterns and torches to arrest the Light of the world; their darkness was so thick that they needed extra light. APPLICATIONPrinciple: A life of genuinely following Jesus will lead others to Christ as well.Q: How do I lead someone to Christ? How can I share the Gospel effectively? A: Follow Jesus closely and genuinely. Follow Jesus up and follow Him down. Follow Jesus wherever He goes.Eventually you will be so attractive that people will want to come to Jesus.Q: In what aspects can I be a faithful follower to lead others to Christ?A: Your faithfulness glows when you serve in church, at schoolYou can serve and be a faithful follower in church by joining the worship chorus, the host team, the small groups; eventually you can lead a Bible study group.You can serve and be a faithful follower at school by not cursing, by respecting Gods name, by praying before your meals, by reverence to Jesus with your heart and by sharing Jesus with others when they see the brilliance of God shining through you. You can share Jesus whenever it is, wherever you are, with whomever that God has called you to. Share Jesus and see the life of that person transformed from shades to light and from despair to hope.2 ChristWe are now going to see a lot of attributes of God, but I would like to focus only on a few of them.2.1 John 18:4-8I think here we have something fun. Now the heavily armed people had come close. Jesus, who knew all things, who knew what was going to happen in a few hours, who knew that He had come to His own but His own acknowledged Him not, and who knew that the very people whom He had come to save would put Him on the cross, did not attempt to escape. He stayed right where He was and revealed Himself before the army started inquiring. He was the one who asked the questions instead:Who are you looking for? Who is it you want?Jesus of Nazareth. They replied.Jesus told them: I am.I AM is the divine name of God. As soon as Jesus said I AM, the army, surprisingly, fell back to the ground-they were in the presence of God.Jesus asked them again:Who is it you want? I told you, I am.They probably fell back again at this point. It would have been very easy for Jesus and His disciples to escape: all Jesus would have to say was I am and the soldiers would have kept on falling down. The arrestors had to bow before the King of kings and the Lord of lords; they had to bow down before they could even arrest Him. Brothers and sisters, Jesus is Lord; Jesus is sovereign; Jesus is God, the great I AM. And He is there for you. I know that you love the great I AM-that is why you are here, to worship the One who was, is and is to come; the First and the Last; the Beginning and the End. We stand in awe of the great I AM.It is immensely beautiful how Jesus stands between us and our enemies. Jesus said: You are looking for me, so let my disciples go.That is what Jesus does: He stands between us and the enemy of our souls. When the enemy shouts: That is a sinner! Jesus defends us: I have paid the price and have bought him from you. He is now mine. We belong to Jesus, FOREVER, because He said in the Scripture that He had lost none and would never lose any of us. You cannot be lost! If you feel deserted, abandoned or lonely, you should read the Scripture, and it will remind you that you cannot be lost: Jesus has found you; He has carved you on the palms of His hand; He prays for you in heaven and He does not forget you. No matter how dark your situation may seem or how sick and heavy you feel, Jesus will not forget you or forsake you. He knows, just as He replied to the enemies, that He is I AM, which made the enemies fell down in the presence of God. Your enemies and obstacles will fall with face down in the same way to the King of kings and Lord of lords, for every knee will bow and every tongue will confess. That is our God standing before us.2.2 John 18:9Jesus is the good shepherd in verse 9, as He stands for us to fulfill the prophesy of Salvation.APPLICATIONPrinciple: Nothing counts more in life than our belief in Jesus.I have done a lot of things that, I thought, could fulfill my life: I thought the business world, advancements and educations were going to satisfy me I thought a lot of things; but I thought wrong. The Bible tells us that nothing can be compared to knowing Jesus and believing in Jesus. When you are confronted with a life-or-death situation, nothing matters except your belief in Jesus, which will carry you through to the end. That is the promise of our great I AM. 3 Cup3.1 John 18:10Verse 10 deals with the last division-the Cup. When Peter saw Judas kissing our Lord Jesus so as to betray Him, Peter had enough. He drew his sword, waved it fiercely and cut off Malchus right ear. (Malchus was a servant of the high priest who came to arrest Jesus.) Maybe Peter thought that even if he could not defeat the whole army, he could at least get at somebodys ear. Poor Peter. Peter loved Jesus, he really did. When he cut off Malchus ear, Peter actually involved himself in great trouble, because he had started the fight, and (for that) he should have gone to the cross. But Jesus, in His kindness, told Peter once again: I love you and I know that you love me, but it is not the time. Put that sword away! What did Jesus do then? I marvel at the majesty of His deed-He healed the mans ear. In doing so Jesus also removed the evidence against Peter, so Peter was now free from being accused as a rebel. Peter reminds us of ourselves when we try to settle something with our own efforts in our own ways and according to our own timing. Jesus reminds us: What you have done is sinful and  will lead you to death, but I will remove the evidence with my blood. You are free and there is now no condemnation for all who is in Jesus. Christ Jesus removes our transgressions as far away from us as the east is from the west.  3.2 John 18:11Jesus told Peter: I must drink the cup My Father gives to me. It was the cup of salvation. It was the cup of Gods wrath. Jesus must drink it so that you and I do not have to drink it. 3.3 John 18:12After that the soldiers arrested and bound Jesus. In fact it was not a rope that kept Jesus bound, but His Fathers will, His pleasure in obeying that will, and His love for us. Jesus was bound to His love for the Father and for us. 3.4 John 18:13-14Then the Scripture goes on to explain the cup. Caiaphas, the high priest, once prophesied: One man must die for the people. Who could that man be? Only someone perfect and sinless could fulfill that role, and His name is Jesus, the great I AM. We cannot shy away from this question: How will you give God His rightful place of authority in life? We call Him our Lord. In the Book of Acts Jesus is Lord is uttered 110 times. How will you give God His rightful place as your Lord? APPLICATIONPrinciple: Obeying is better than offering sacrifices.What does obedience mean? To obey means to acknowledge that God is the potter and we are the clay; to humble ourselves and put away our pride; to submit to Gods authority; to respond to His love and to follow His commands. Obey, without questioning Gods wisdom. Obey immediately, completely and whole-heartedly.  CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, cohort in John18: 1-3 describes Jesus as a suffering servant; Christ in John 18:4-9 depicts Him as our sovereign Shepherd; cup in John 18:10-14 shows us His submissive sacrifice-Jesus is the Lamb who was slain to take away our sins.We thought 9/11 would change the world; in a way it did. But actually Jesus is the One who changed the world; it is the day He died that made all the differences in human history. A lot of us, when threatened by dark times, burst out asking:Q: Where and how can I find the strength to cope with them?A: It comes from trusting and obeying Jesus. Q: Where is God when hard time comes?A: He is on the throne; He is there forever.Please keep in mind that no matter how grave your sufferings may seem at the moment, Jesus is forever on the throne. Say it aloud: Jesus is forever on the throne. Not a single one of your difficulties or tears escapes His attention. He is willing to spend full-time His energy, effort, love and resources to make sure that you-His son or daughter-experiences the fullness of life that He desires for you. So do not run away from problems or panic when challenges looms. Instead shout out: Jesus is Lord! And He is on the throne forever and ever and ever! Amen. APPLICATIONPrinciple1: A life of genuinely following Jesus will lead others to Christ as well.Principle2: Nothing counts more in life than our belief in Jesus.Principle3: Obeying is better than offering sacrifices.With love and strength from Jesus Christ, summarized by Shirley, Esther and Chong.9/11/2011                          The Cup or the Sword                       Stephen WongHaidian Christian Church  PAGE 8 /  NUMPAGES  8"

We know that the Cross is the power of our God, and Jesus Christ is powerful and almighty God. Now there is a sister, who is going to share her testimony, How did Jesus save her and her family. Lets watch the video.Thanks to our God for His love and dying for us. Today we are going to continue to study Gospel John 19.Scripture Reading: John 19:5 When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, Here is the man!Todays sermon will be given by Pastor David. The topic is Pilate said to them: Here is the man! Welcome Pastor David. Sermon Pilate and the Jesus who stands before us.Imagine Jesus standing before you at his trail, Here is the man, the human being like you and me, but the poorest of the poor, with the crown of thrones and going to His death on the cross. Here is the man, and the Pilate, the man of all earthly power, cannot understand the person he is looking at and asks the question of Jesus, What is truth? Jesus had already given the answer to the question to His disciples. He said to them John 14:6 I am the way and the truth and the life.Jesus who is the way. Jesus is the truth and the answer to Pilates question, He is also the way, the path or the road which you and I travel in our lives. Wherever we go and whatever path we take, Jesus promises us that He is the way for us. I am sure there is no one here who has not felt, at one time or another, being lost. I know when I first came to Beijing, I was completely lost in this great and vast city. I stood on the street corner and had no idea where I was or where to go. Fortunately I had good Christian friends who helped me. But all of us have known that terrible feeling of being lost, perhaps as a student in a new university or someone in a strange country or a strange town. Jesus promises us that wherever our way and path takes us, we will never be lost for He is the way and He is the true way and the way of life, I am the way and the truth and the lifeAnd the path and road that Jesus took during His trail and crucifixion was darker than any way we can possibly know in our lives. Jesus even knew what it was to experience Gods absence when He cried from the cross My God my God, why have you forsaken me? And so we can trust that in those moments in our lives when God seems far away, or even not to exist and we doubt and fear, Jesus is beside us and says I know what is that like and I am still with you. Jesus is with us in no matter what happens to us in our lives and He will not forsake us. The way to the Cross.And imagine now Jesus on His walk and journey to the cross, His road and His way. Here is the man who bears the insults of all around Him, despised and insulted, with nothing at all to own on our earthly wealth. We are told in Johns Gospel that even His clothes were stripped from Him. Here is the man who is the poorest and weakest of all human creatures. And yet while He is hanging on the cross, and almost at His death, it is Pilate the earthly ruler, who wrote above His head This man is a king, This poor and despised man is a king and is our king, how can this be and how does Jesus on the cross show His kingship to us? He shows it by His love. Even in the darkest of all places --- the cross full of hate and violence and death itself, Jesus shows His love. And we are told in the Gospel even there He can take care of His mother and give her to John His friend and disciple, to be looked after. In the midst of so much hatred, the way of Jesus is the way of love and not hate, and that is why Jesus is our king, for His power on the cross is not worldly power or the power of money or wealth. It is not the power of guns or violence; it is the power of love. And Jesus calls for love,not hate, He calls all of us to love. For He loves us and He asks that we love Him and because we love Him, we must love one another, for Christ is in all of us. Jesus as the completion of all things.Jesus last word from the cross in Johns Gospel, the last word He spoke as a human being in His earthly life it is finished. There are two ways to understand that. We can say it is finished, it is done or it is no good, it is broken or we can say it is finished in the way Jesus wanted on the cross. It is perfected, it is completed because we see that in His dying, Jesus tells us that there is nothing and nowhere in any experience we can have even death itself that is outside the love of Jesus. He is our way and so on the cross thats not the end but the perfection of everything. For on the cross Jesus defeats death by dying Himself and He comes to life again on Easter morning and so we can say now there is nothing at all in all creation, nothing that we can possibly know that stands outside the love of Jesus and His kingly rule and that is why on the cross Jesus is our King.Jesus who loves us is the object of our love. The great miracle is that it is not only that Jesus loves us as He does perfectly, but His love pulls us to love Him. Remember how He began His life. A human baby, the weakest and most helpless of all creatures and as a baby, Jesus the Son of God called down the love of Marry and Joseph His parents upon Him in His utter weakness. He asks that we love and care for Him as He loves and cares for us. That is His power, the power of the child, the power of the dying man to call forth our love upon Him and therefore to make us loving creatures as He is perfectly served. In death there is life.And so we are told in the gospel that after His death on the cross, His friends and disciples and followers lovingly and carefully took down His body and placed it in the tomb. The tomb was of course not a place of death but a place where Jesus defeated death for that was not the end of the story. At His beginning as a baby and His end in the weakness of death, Jesus calls for our love for Him, He needs us and that is His power and our love of course never stops there. For Christ is in each one of us .There is no one in this room in which Christ is not present and therefore, there is no one in this room who remains outside the love of yours or mine. And Jesus asks that if you have quarrels or feel of hatred or negative feelings, overcome that and feel rather the love of Jesus called out in you for all. Here is the man, the man who sees before us as a trial. Weak, broken and despised close to death, a death beyond our imagination in its pain and horror but that is not the end of the story, that is never the end.For the story goes on, each Sunday as we celebrate the mystery of God Christ together, the death of Christ turned into life, so that you and I, as we go our ways, need to have no fear of anything not even death itself, for even there Jesus is with us and beside us and the end of the story is life and life eternal. And that is what we celebrate here in this church and churches throughout the world. The man who stands before us is what makes us truly human and indeed divine and so let us pray:We may know more truly the love of God in Jesus Christ, the love that Jesus Christ shows for us in His death and in His resurrection, and we pray Father that we in our lives may reflect that love in the world around us so that it becomes a world driven not by hatred or grief or anger or fear, but a world in which the love of God is in everyones heart and directs our life. Amen.With love and strength in Jesus Christ, summarized by Shirley, Stefanie, and Sunshine, Proofread by Liu Laoshi."

Todays sermon topic is Seeing and Believing. The sermon will be given by Cathy.Sermon by Cathy:Good morning, please join me in a very short prayer:Lord, every day we have so many desires in our hearts, please let us understand that you are the greatest provider. And you are always there to make available what we need. Send Your Spirit to us now please, so we may listen and watch now for what You offer us today through Your Word and Your Spirit. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.We all know the story of the good Samaritan. But in Chinese context, especially in August, there was a heated discussion. And you will understand that there may be a danger to be a good Samaritan. I do not know if you have followed the news, but in August there was an accident, causing attention all over China. You can see the video. This is the bus driver, he drove a bus one day, crossed the bridge, and there, from the other side, you can see that, there was a bike falling down and there was an old lady laid beside the bus. So this bus driver stopped the bus, went down with the bus ticket conductor. They talked with the lady, and put her aside. The lady later accused him of being the one who knocked her down. The lucky thing is that this bus actually has a camera on it. You know the bus has a camera in the front. So the driver drove to the police station. And show the policemen the video that proved his innocence. He is lucky. But the other cases happened in 2006 in Nanjing and also later in 2009 in Tianjin, the two young men were not that lucky. The 2006 one in Nanjing, his name is called Peng Yu. And that makes Nanjing quite famous now. whenever people talk about the case of Peng Yu we all know that it relates to Nanjing. He went down from a bus, and saw a lady. , He claimed that the lady fell down because the bus was very crowded, but the old lady accused him of knocking her down. In Chinese law if you accuse somebody, it is the accusers responsibility to offer the proof. But she cannot offer the proof, still the judge asked this young man Peng Yu to pay the fine. You know there was a huge debate because the judge made the final decision through his reasoning. And also the same thing happened in Tianjin a case similar to Peng Yu. It is also the same thing that the accuser could not offer the proof, and still the person being accused was punished. So from these cases, it seems to be very true that seeing is believing. As the Chinese idiom says,  (yan3 jian4 wei3 shi2). And if we cannot see we just cannot believe. So people were hurt a lot, and they feel that we cannot trust the law any more, and we cannot trust people, what else can we trust? And the common knowledge also is like that if you cannot see, you cannot believe. So it is in the gospel of John, chapter 20. Look at chapter 20, it is all related with seeing and believing. Mary went first. She did not see the body, but she saw the tomb stone was removed, so she went back to tell the brothers and the two brothers came. They did not see the body, they only saw the wrappings. And in verse 8, it is said then the other disciple who reached the tomb first also went in and he saw and believed. He saw and believed. Believed in what? Resurrection? No. Because the next verse says that as yet they did not understand the scripture that He (Jesus) must rise from the dead, so they actually left and went home. And then Jesus showed Himself to the disciples., All the disciples except Thomas saw Jesus and believed. The doubting Thomas insisted that he himself needed to see Jesus and touch in His hands the print of the nailsbefore he could believe. In chapter 20, we see that Jesus also came and showed Himself to Thomas. So Thomas also saw and believed. After all this seeing and believing, Jesus said, have you believed because you have seen me, blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe. As the summary of this whole chapter, the writer said, Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book, but these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God and through believing in His name, you may have life. So this could be the end of the Book of John, (some thought that this chapter was the first ending of the gospel of John,, maybe the other chapter, chapter 21, was  added later). It summarizes that among all the signs, they have chosen to write some of them and recorded them here, but not all signs were recorded. All the signs are not the main purpose, but the signs that are leading to belief, and to believe is related to LIFE. Throughout the whole chapter, actually, throughout the gospel of John, seeing and believing is always related together, and there is a tension between seeing and believing. Many people believed because they had seen Jesus, like the Samaritan woman and her town people because they saw Jesus and stayed with Jesus, and they believed. And many believed after the miracles of Jesusfeeding many people. And many believed because they had seen the healing power of Jesus. It is natural that after you see and your being touched, you came to believe. Once in a sermon, I shared that in the doubting Thomas story, for us who have not come to believe, it is ok that you have some doubts. It is ok that you still cannot believe because you cannot see or you have not seen. It is fine and it is natural. But today I want to challenge you. Because maybe you will never get to believe if you only or you always try to stick to believing after seeing. It is the common, natural or ordinary sequence that we see then we believe. But actually, what we see is not perfectly true. These people around Jesus at that time, they saw Jesus, but they still, even the disciples, could not believe that Jesus could rise up again. And during the last sermon of last Sunday, Professor David Jasper also said about, Pilate said to the others, Here is the man. They all saw the man on the cross, did what they see give them the belief or faith, or lead them to faith? No. So actually, the tension can also be seen from this chapter. For instance, Mary saw the tomb stone was moved and the tomb was empty. And she saw the angels and then she saw Jesus. Did she recognize Jesus? No. How did she recognize Jesus? It is through hearing. For Mary, seeing is not as good as hearing. Hearing brought her to recognize Jesus because Jesus called her in a familiar way. For some people you can see, or you can feel that love of God because you can see, feel or hear the stories from somebody else. Seeing is definitely not the only way to believe .On the contrary, if we claim that we have faith we should start from believing or maybe half believing, or try to suspend your habit of seeing and believing. To give it a try, or to experience first, suspend your doubts for a minute, but to do something so that you can start believing.Come back to the cases I mentioned before because the cases were heatedly discussed and it was on the CCTV actually. Because it is very hurting, people feel that we could not trust the law, we could not trust others, what else could we trust? And actually, we have been talking about the loss of trustworthiness for a long time. It is dangerous, and it is going to be very terrible and horrible to China. Isnt it depressing if you help somebody like the good Samaritan, but you were accused of being the guilty, and no one could help you, even the law could not help you? Are you going to lose your faith in God? Or are you willing to help others next time? Or are you able to? So if we stick to the doctrine that seeing is believing, we are not going to do any good. We are not going to be able to reconstruct our trustworthiness. We simply have to believe the necessity and goodness of the trustworthy God so that we can act out our trustworthiness, together we can build or reconstruct our moral system to make our community a good witness. At least, our Christian community can be a trustworthy community. But first of all you have to believe. It is impossible actually for others to imagine that to give, you have to give up first. But we can because we believe that Christ has given up Himself for us just to save us. And no matter we are poor or rich, bad or good, we are loved by God and we have been given this gift of believing at first hand and it is free. We are blessed because we believe in Jesus Christ even after 2000 years without eye-witnesses, but we came to believe through all kinds of ways through listening and participation. Seeing may not help you all the time and what you see may not be true all the time. Seeing could not be the only way to believe in order to reconstruct our trustworthiness with each other. And with God we need to have other ways: listen to your hearts, listen to the people around you, come to church and join the group, talk with people and participate in ministries. Although you may have not reached the belief, or you may not have fully believed, but others have believed, so just give yourself an opportunity to try to suspend your disbelief a little bit, and just participate first, and join the group first. You can gradually come to believe by listening and participation. Our church has been growing so fast and there are many ministries unprepared or undone. I hope you all can be patient and stay with us, create chances to serve and keep walking with us. Please stay! What I mean is that last Sunday we have called for the small group, and actually we cannot meet all the needs. I just hope that if you notice that. Give us more time and be patient. We are trying and calling for more leaders to serve in this ministry, and your prayers are needed. If you felt you were ignored when you came to the church, please forgive us. We hope you can talk to somebody and someday you will have an opportunity to serve. In this way, while you are participating, listening and joining us, we are together giving our God a chance to suspend our disbelief and only in this way is God helping us come to believe without the need of seeing. Seeing and believing is always a topic, and will always stay  in  your mind. When you are doubting about this, actually, there is some chance.And next, we are going to have a pastor from Washington D.C., who is going to talk more about Seeing and Believing. Sermon by Pastor SteveGood morning, it is a great privilege and honour to bring and share the word of God to this country that I so deeply love. Ms Cathy, I appreciate your words because it is about BELIEVE, it is about believe in that Jesus died on the cross, it is about believe in that Jesus that fills your heart and changes you. That is the belief that I want to embrace. That is the belief that I know many of you here embrace. As you came, as you were deciding this morning what to do with your time in a room this size, there are three types of people. Those that you are just here, a friend invited you, you do not believe, you do not believe in this God of the universe that created the beauty of our country, that put the planets in the motion, that put the stars in the heavens. You know today, September 25th of 2011, might be your day, your day to put your faith in Jesus. You know, some of you have come in here with a child-like faith. You know this belief that Cathy was talking about  see Jesus, and you just want to touch Him, you want to make sense here (the speaker postures to his head), and here (the speaker postures to his heart). And you want to grow. And many of you in this room, you are mature believers, you are hungry for the Word, you are hungry for people to hear about the only true God, the only One that can change the course of mankind. And the last verse of John 20, it says, by believing you may have life in His name (the speaker repeats the verse). In John 10:10, it says that Jesus came to give you life and to give it abundantly! Not material possessions, not in wealth, but to give you the life that only comes in by in-dwelling of  the Holy Spirit. That is where the fulfilling life comes. I want to put this into a little bit of practice for you.If you have your Bible with you, if you would turn to Luke chapter 5, and we are going to start reading in verse one, because no matter where you are, which of these three types of people you are today about your belief, this is what Luke 5 says;1One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the people crowding round him and listening to the word of God,2he saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.3He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.4When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.5Simon answered, Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything.Now, hear this verse, hear this line,But because you say so, I will do it.And you know sometimes God calls us to do things that just seem to be ridiculous. Well, I am supposed to give up my life and surrender my life to follow Him. You know, for my family, what seemed a ridiculous starter 15 years ago  God put this burden in our family to adopt a child. And in our family picture up here (he pointed to the big projector screen) you will see that God has allowed us to adopt three precious jewels from this beautiful country  the low girl holding the E on the left, Abby, she is from Chongqing; the girl on the right is Lily, from Guangzhou; and the older one on the far right is from Dongguan. You know, when God told us this, all He said was, Steve, do you believe me? Do you believe that this is from me? And it radically changed our life, and it radically changed all five of our children. You know, if you go back to Luke 5, that last line, it says, But because you say so, I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. And we are talking about a life-changing moment; we are talking about someone that is going to change the course of history for you, generation after generation after generation embracing the love of the Heavenly Father. That is the Jesus we serve. And I think about what is in 2 Timothy, Chapter 4, verses 9 to 10, , you know sometimes we see those things, but we also see the things of the world, and it says,Do your best to come to me quickly, for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. You know as you heard from John 20, it is about believe, it is about believe. So for you, today, when Jesus says, Whom do you say I am? we have not physically touched His hands, but we have seen Him, we have seen Him at work. We have seen Him in the lives of our friends, but for you, when your head hits the pillow, whom do you say Jesus is? Is He the King of kings, the Lord of lords, the Prince of peace, or is He just another great teacher? You know, for those of you that came not believing, we want to give you an opportunity to put your faith in Jesus today for the first time to say that, Jesus, I give my life to you. I am a sinner in need of a saviour. I have betrayed you, and I want a relationship with you. Would you pray with me?Father God, we invite you into this place, and we pray that your Holy Spirit right now would just move in the heart of each person here, that your Holy Spirit would stir up those people that have been wanting that relationship with their Heavenly Father. Lord, today can be the first day for them to put their faith in you. And if that is you, it is a simple prayer. You do not have to pray my word, you just pray Gods word that, God, I am a sinner, and I want to believe in you today, I want to become a child of the King, a son of the Most High, a daughter of the King of creation. And I invite you into my life today.You know if that is you, the Scripture says, Whoever confesses me before men, I too will confess before the Father. If that is you, and you feel comfortable doing so, I am going to invite you to just stand right where you are at, and say, Jesus, today, I am putting my faith in you. So if that is you, I just want to invite you to stand now, and say, Jesus, I am following you today. Amen, amen, amen! Now for some of you that are saying you know, I am a follower of Jesus, are you willing to answer Luke 5 today -- Because you say so, I will do it? What is it that God speaks in your heart? Is it about boldness of faith? Is it about sharing with a neighbour? Is it about reading scripture? Is it about knowing God more intimately? Is it about embracing the power of the Holy Spirit? Is it about doing something that makes absolutely non-sense, like it was for our family. You know we had two children, and God called us to adopt more. And we knew it was the voice of God. Maybe today, God is speaking something to you, and you want to have the faith to do it, you want to have the faith to stand and say, God, I do not know how it is going to turn out, or how it is going to happen, but I believe in you that this is word from you, and I am willing to act on it. Now I want to pray for you also, because I know there are many of you in this room, that is you, that God has been speaking to your heart, that God has been moving in your life, that God is putting His people around you. I want to take a minute and pray for you today also. Jesus, we come to you for these people, Lord, that each one of us would be able to say that Lord, because you say so, I will do it, whatever it is. Lord, if it is from you that is where we want to be. Just like you called Joshua to step into a flooding river, and your parted the river, Lord, give us the boldness of faith to respond with Yes, Lord, yes, Lord! Lord, we would pray a thousand YESes before you even ask. Whatever you ask of us, Lord, we would do that. Jesus, bless those people, and show them what you have for them. Amen.Ms Cathy, thank you so much for that encouraging words. And I hope today you saw one thing, you saw Jesus. You know from that beautiful song, you just say, Yesu, Yesu it is the name above all names. If that is you, God is stirring up your heart, do not leave today without finding somebody from the leadership team or the worship team to pray for you. Let 25th September be the day that changes your life for ever, because this is the day that the Lord has made. And we are going to rejoice and be glad in it. Amen.Written, edited and co-ordinated with the help from Katherine, Shirley, Yitian Kong and Franz, Proofread by Liu Laoshi, and the guiding of the Lord.Seeing and Believing25/09/2011                                                           Cathy Zhang and Steve AllenPAGE  PAGE  7Haidian Christian Church "

It happened this way: 2 Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. 3 Im going out to fish, Simon Peter told them, and they said, Well go with you. So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing. 4 Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. 5 He called out to them, Friends, havent you any fish?   No, they answered. 6 He said, Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some. When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. 7 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord! As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, It is the Lord, he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. 8 The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. 9 When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread. 10 Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish you have just caught. 11 So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. 12 Jesus said to them, Come and have breakfast. None of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? They knew it was the Lord. 13 Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. 14 This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.PRAYERLet us bow in prayer: O Lord my God, earnestly we seek you; our souls thirst for you like a dry land thirsts for water. Our souls have seen you in the sanctuary; our souls have beheld your beauty; our souls have been satisfied with you-you are everything that we desire, that we want and that we need. And so Father, as we have worshiped you with songs, we now desire to worship you in our study of the Word. With our lips and with our lives, we cry out: Holy Spirit, empty us and fill us with Thy self, so that we will display the presence, the power and the beauty of our Lord Jesus Christ in our lives wherever we go. So bless this Word to our hearts, feed us with your Holy mysteries, and change us, transform us so that you can be glorified through us. We pray in the  mighty, matchless and marvelous name of your Son Jesus. Amen.INTRODUCTIONGood morning. How many of you think that breakfast is important? How many of you had breakfast? How many of you had breakfast with Jesus? A national survey in another country found that 93% of the surveyed said that breakfast was essential. Breakfast is important for health, for alertness and for a long life. But only 44% of those surveyed actually have breakfast. I imagine that some of those 44% only have for breakfast a cup of Starbucks coffee-that was their breakfast. Today, we are going to find out a little bit more about breakfast with Jesus and how this treat gives us a fresh and new fire for God. Would you like that?CHAPTER REVIEWSince this is the final chapter of the Gospel of John, we will take a quick review. The book of John can be divided into four parts:1:1-18Prologue1:19-17:26The Sons Signs &Secrets18-20The Sons Sorrows21EpilogueIn John there are three noticeable sets of sevens:The Seven Key WordsFather121 timesKnow117 timesBelieve99 timesTruth 66 timesLove57 timesLife 36 timesLight23 timesThe chart shows us their frequency of usage. It is not surprising: that God wants us to know and believe in Him that He is true, that He loves you and that He offers you life and light. The Seven SignsThe seven signs are particularly beautiful because they tell us so much about our God. Water into WineJesus Power over QualityHealing the Dying SonJesus Power over DistanceHealing the InvalidJesus Power over TimeFeeding the 5,000Jesus Power over QuantityWalking on WaterJesus Power over CreationHealing the BlindJesus Power over DarknessRaising LazarusJesus Power over DeathI think you can conclude safely that Jesus is powerful. He is God of awesome wonders. The Seven I AMI AM the Bread of LifeI AM the Light of the WorldI AM the GateI AM the Good ShepherdI AM the Resurrection and the LifeI AM the Way, the Truth, the LifeI AM the True VineIn the Old Testament, God revealed Himself in the burning bush and told Moses: I AM WHO I AM. The sentence is a little bit incomplete, but it is incomplete for a reason: Jesus completes the sentence by saying: I AM the Resurrection and the Life. Jesus completes the revelation of God, because God has been seeking to connect with you; and now He has connected with you through His beloved and only begotten Son: our Savior, precious Jesus. The previous chapter John 20 is about Jesus rising from the dead and His appearing over a forty-day period to His disciples. In particular He appeared to the ten without Thomas; then He appeared to the eleven including Thomas, where Thomas gave his confession of faith: My Lord and my God! It was a beautiful lesson: Seeing is not necessarily believing; it is really believing that is seeing. When we believe, we truly see-we see Jesus, we see the truth, we see God. John 21 can be divided into three parts:1-14Revelation of Jesus15-17Restoration of Peter18-25Redirection of Peters and Johns livesSERMONToday our focus is on 1-14, which can also be put into three parts:1-7Sovereign8-12Servant13-14SufficiencyLet us dive in and see where God leads us in the revelation of Himself.  SovereignScripture in Detail (John 21:1-7)John 21:1-2Afterward Jesus appeared again to His disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It happened this way: Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.Why were they by the Sea of Tiberias? Tiberias was the Sea of Galilee. The disciples were supposed to be there because Jesus had appeared to the woman and said: Tell my brothers that I am going to meet them in Galilee. The disciples were obedient and they went. Jesus did not show up right away so they had some time to wait. There were seven of them. You remember Peter: when everyone was deserting Jesus because of the Bread of Life discourse, Jesus turned to His disciples and asked them whether they would leave as well. Peter stood up and said: Lord, to whom shall we go? You alone have the words of eternal life. Peter was saying that Jesus was God and they could not go anywhere because they were His. You remember Nathanael: He confessed that Jesus was the Holy One of God and the King of Israel because Jesus said He saw Nathanael under the tree.These men were lovers of God. And on that day they went fishing. It was not unusual that they were fishing-many of Jesus followers were fishermen. Fishing is a good image for ministry: it reaches out, captures and draws people into the net of Gods love.John 21:3What was the result of their fishing trip? Remember, these were professionals who were experienced and fully equipped. They had sailed on this lake all their lives-they knew the spots, the timing and everything about fishing-if you ever want to succeed in fishing, you stick with these guys. But what was the fishing result that night?Im going out to fish, Simon Peter told them, and they said, Well go with you. So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.Nothing? With all these expertise, experience and equipment,  they caught nothing? It was not unusual to fish at night. The men lit the torches, attracted the fish using the torch light and then threw out the net for the reward. But that night was an unusual night: they caught nothing. It was not surprising. Jesus had told them a while back: Apart from me, you can do nothing. That hurts my human pride so much: I cannot do anything-even if it is something that I have been trained in, even if I have the best technology or even if I have everything going for me. I cannot do anything without Jesus. I know why: Because Jesus has given it to me in the first place. Everything that we are and everything that we have is not acquired by us; it was  given by God. Its source and origin is found in God. Now I understand: there is no place for pride or for ownership, because everything comes from God-the Creator of the universe and the Creator of all that is seen and unseen. Now if I get it: apart from Jesus, I can do nothing. Time, talents and opportunities are given by God, otherwise my life and history would have been nothing. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you.John 21: 4What happened after a futile night of fishing?Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.All through the night and the early morning, the overseer of their souls was watching. He is the One who watches over Israel, over the church and over you, and He never sleeps. He saw His friends going through such a difficult time. But for them He was there; He was near; and He was in prayer, because He cared. Was He not wonderful, that overseer of our souls? No matter how dark or how long that darkness endures, the Bible tells us that weeping may last throughout the night, but joy comes in the morning. One of my friends suffered from a very painful pregnancy throughout the night. When the doctors asked her what the name of her newborn would be, she answered after a silent prayer: Joy. For her it was really a joyful morning: when the doctor slapped the infant gently, air went into her lungs and she cried her first cry- the cry of joy. Joy-that is  what happens in the morning.John 21:5The disciples knew that it was Jesus custom to get up early in the morning and pray to His Father in solitary-a very good custom for us to follow.Now that Jesus saw His disciples fishing. Did He say: You failed me again-you deserted me and denied me-and now you are fishing? No. Instead He said:Friends, havent you any fish?We know the word friends is charged with meaning. Jesus said: Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. (KJV John 15:13) He also said: I no longer call you servants I call you friends. (NIV John 15:15-17) -You call me friend? But I am an outcast, a murderer and a liar-Yes, you are my friend when you believe in me.-You make me your friend?-Yes, because I have revealed everything my Father has designed for you to know. I have come to reveal everything for you.-You have given me those hidden things and treasures? Me?-Yes, you.You and I are His friends, and no one can undo that friendship. John 21:6Friends, havent you any fish?No, they answered.The disciples possibly thought: No, we did not catch anything. We are a failure, we must confess. We failed in the Academy of Fishing. But Jesus said: I know you have problems and challenges, but I have solutions. That is great, said the disciples, because this is a very long night and we are tired, besides we do not want to come to shore and show the public that we have caught nothing. It is kind of embarrassing. So what is the solution? He said, Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.In the mean time Jesus was gathering those 153 fish so that when the disciples looked down into the water they saw those fish ready for capture. Isnt Jesus such a wonderful God?Obedience is the lesson. As soon as we obey, we can see that God has results for us. John 21:7John now remembered that something similar had happened before-when they were first called by Jesus. Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord! As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, It is the Lord, he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.Peter completed a beautiful ten-point dive and swam to get to Jesus as if he was in a competition- he could not wait to be close to Jesus. It was too time-consuming for Peter to navigate the boat and the fishes were too heavy; he was leaving everything behind so as to reach Jesus. What a wonderful example of passion for God. 1.2 Principle 1:The secret to spiritual success is dependence and obedience.You may not see a visible result, but God does. He is working out His plan, His way and His time. You will be successful in Gods eyes, and that is what counts. So depend on Him and obey Him.Application Question 1 and Answers from the Scripture:1.3.1 Questions:How is living your own way working out for you?How will you start living a Jesus directed life?Before I became a pastor I had worked and worked and worked in the sales field, because if I did not work, I would have no customers; and if I had no customers, my boss would not have paid me a cent. So I understand that it is really hard when you are forced to study or work 24 hours a day. But Jesus says: I have a solution. If you let me direct your life, you will have success. Practically speaking, how can one have a Jesus directed life? 1.3.2 Suggestions:My suggestions are derived from todays passage of the scripture:(1)  Obey-be where God wants you to be and do what God wants you to do (John 21:1)(2)  Listen for and to His voice-spend time waiting upon Him and listen (John 21:5-6)(3)  Confess-admit that you have caught no fish and that what you are doing is not working (John 21:5)(4)  Seek to be close to Jesus be like Peter: take the dive to be close to Jesus (John 21:7)The primary way of waiting is in His word. God has given us His word-the Bible- so that we can get close to Him and that we can be spiritually successful. Jesus, Our ServantScripture in Detail (John 21:8-12)2.1.1 John 21:9Jesus was so tender:When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.Jesus was so caring; He knew that they had been working all night without any food so He prepared a delicious breakfast for them. The disciples were relieved.Peter, however, was torn. The fire reminded him and the past came like a flood: it was at another fire side that he had denied his Lord Jesus. But Jesus did not say a word; He just offered them the food because He knew their needs. 2.1.2 John 21:10Jesus was gracious:Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish you have just caught.But who really caught the fish? It was Jesus. But even if He did all the work, He wanted His followers to participate and be part of the team and the family. He wants us to be His friends in everything that He does.2.1.3 John 21:11Not only was Jesus gracious, He was also generous:So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. He gave the disciples 153 fish; not small fish, but large ones. God delights in blessing you abundantly, immeasurably, exceedingly, infinitely and beyond what you can ask or imagine. That is our God blessing you out of the glorious riches of His grace. He loves you and He spends so much in you. Besides, Jesus is our security: the net did not break. Jesus is like that gate of protection. Once we are in the Fathers hand, once we are His, no one can pluck us out. That is why we want as many people as possible in this city and this beautiful nation of China to be in the net of Gods love. That net will never tear. Once you are His, you will always be His.2.1.4 John 21:12It is where Jesus invites them: Come and have breakfast.We love these come invitations when we first meet Jesus. He told His disciples, Come and see. Come and experience a day with me.  We also remember the come when Jesus disciples came back exhausted after a mission trip, before He said, Come with me. Lets get some rest. We know these famous words: Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. (Matthew 11:28) The best come is when He says I am coming-because sometimes we do not come, He comes; when we are not faithful, He is still faithful. And He says, I am coming. The Spirit says, I am coming. We want Him to come. Come, Lord Jesus. Come! Come into my life, come into my situation. Come. He tells you, Come, too. I want you to come. There is no more distance between us. Come, Come, Come. Principle 2:The secret for spiritual progress and mturityis time with God. Your maturity and progress in the spiritual life is proportional to the time you spend with God. Application Question 2 and Answers from the Scripture:Question: How can you make the time appointments that you have with Jesus a priority?Suggestions:Rise up early to be with God (John 21:4)Many people tell me: I am too busy. I got work to do; I got family situations to attend to. Rise up early. Jesus rose up early. You can rise up early, too. Wake up at 4 or 3 or 2 oclock. And make an unbreakable appointment with Jesus. Ask God to set your heart on fire (John 21:9)As we see the fire and the course, we say: Lord, light my heart up too; get me fired up again. I want to be excited for Jesus again. Renew that love, that first love that I had for you.. Fire me up again: I am not excited enough, get me excited for Jesus! Lord, make yourself more real and personal to me. Speak to me, fire me up! Let me burn, so that I will burn others around me with your love. Let me burn with your love. Lets be burning ones as we worship God and as we walk as His witnesses.  Bring your time, talents & treasure to God (John 21:10)Submit to His Lordship (John 21:12)Tell everybody: It is the Lord. -Why are you the way you are? -It is the Lord. -Why do you do what you do? -It is the Lord.-How can you be so different? -It is the Lord.And you are going to start experiencing a renewed love from God. Jesus, Our Sufficiency (John 212:13-14)How did Jesus satisfy the disciples in verse 13? He satisfied them with His provision. In verse 14, He satisfied them with His presence and His resurrection power-He was raised from the death. And this is probably the most satisfying gift that He gave to us. We think we have many, many problems; some are solvable, for example family problems and work problems, while others are not, for example death. But God says: I can satisfy you because I am your sufficiency. I satisfy you with my provisions, presence and power-the power to overcome sin and death. Those are our real problems: sin and death. But Jesus gives us the resurrection of life-an infinite life, an indestructible life, an invincible life, an incredible life and an incomparable life. He gives us life- real life, abundant life, life without end, life with unending joy, life with unending peace-LIFE, LIFE, LIFE. CONCLUSIONThis is Jesus whom we worship and whom we serve. I pray that youve seen the great I AM today with me in the new light. I pray that He is going to be your God if you havent made that commitment to be His friend; He wants you to be His friend. And if you know Him, I pray you will seek Him with all your heart to have a deeper passion and relationship with God, so that when you live your life, love and light will overflow upon those around you, and people will say: It is the Lord.

Please join me in a very short prayer. Lord of mercy, Lord of glory, Lord of creation, please send your Spirit to us today so that all of us can be enlightened and strengthened by your Spirit and your glory and your love. May the meditation of my mind and the words of my mouth be pleasing to you and open all of our hearts to hear your words.We pray in Jesus Christs name. Amen.Main body:The passage:Today we will focus on this feeding miracle. It appears in all four gospels, in Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John. They have all recorded this miracle story and they have very similar sayings, for instance, the breaking of the bread/loaves, and saying thanks to heaven before Jesus divided the loaves and the fish. But only in Mark, you have a very vivid, detailed description, and only in Mark, you see these two verbs, go and see. The previous Sunday, I was talking about faith, Christian faith. Actually it is a faith of actions. The faith you need to live out, to show and to do things. You need to do. And last time, I talked about that we suspend our disbelief to try first and today, again, I will talk about go and see, these two verbs also focusing on actions. First, why Jesus asked the disciples to go and see. It was a big crowd following Jesus because Jesus had done many miracles, healing miracles. And it was getting dark. The disciples noticed the pressure of a huge group following them as the masters, as the leaders. They knew something had to be done. So they worried and they figured out and they came to Jesus. The disciples said to Jesus, Send them away, for there are too many people and we cannot feed them all. Think of that, 5000 people gathering around, and they are poor and needy. But Jesus said, You give them something to eat. Pressure came again to the disciples. How? How can we? And they raised the difficulties to Jesus again. Two difficulties: one, it costs a lot of money! 2000 calories each (should be 700 calories), think of those poor people, the disciples are poor, too. Jesus is poor. It costs a lot of money to buy the food to feed so many people. The second difficulty is that it is a long journey for them if they want to buy some food; it takes them a long time. It is a long journey. It is tiring and tiresome. So Jesus said, go and see, how many loaves you have? So the disciples went and see, found two fish and five loaves, and then Jesus performed the miracles. Why did Jesus want them to go and see? The purpose for them was to turn their eyes away from God to the people around them. The disciples were following Jesus, listening to Jesus all the time, trying to comprehend the mystery, and trying to learn from their master.  But it was time then for them to turn their eyes away and look around the people. It is the purpose of Christian faith, not only to listen to God or focus on Gods words and teachings, but also to serve, to turn your eyes away and look around your world,  taking up your responsibilities. Be the partners of God and serve with God. So that is why Jesus said go and see, and find something, then God will help you figure out what to do. So many people to feed. Yes, go and see what you can get, 5 loaves and 2 fish, and God can finish the miracle. 5000 were satisfied and there were still more. 12 baskets of leftovers, what a wonderful thing. The message:So the first why Jesus wants the disciples to go and see. We are the disciples, too. So the teaching is that -- turn your eyes form Gods teaching, from your meditation to do something, to look around the world, and go and see their situation. Secondly, what follows go and see is to respond and serve. After the disciples went and saw the need, the situation, and they fetched 5 loaves and 2 fish back to Jesus. Jesus responded and served the people. We always say we follow Jesus, and Jesus is our model and our example, so that is how we respond with love and compassion. To respond with love and compassion actually also requires something. It requires, first of all, an attitude of humility. A lot of times we go and help others, it is that we love to help others; we love to serve the church. But maybe we go and see in a hurry, and we always want to present our ideas, we may notice the difficulty and the mistakes there immediately, and then we are rushing to provide our good suggestions and we think we are right. However, if we go and see, what is hidden behind is our attitude of humility, our humble attitude to listen first and to observe the situation more carefully.  Principle:Christianity in China:For instance, the religious situation of China has long been a topic in the world. You see many foreigners coming to China, and also you can see many reports talking about the persecution here. However, if you are here, you know that it is only one side of the story, maybe, only a quarter of the story. It is a complicated situation here. During the National Holiday, I was in Nanjing, and I went to Xuanwu Lake with my friends. We were surprised to hear the hymns not far from the entrance besides the lake. A group of people with their guitar, like our hymn choir group, with microphone and soundbox, they were singing hymns loudly and freely. Some people were sitting in front of them, listening, joining or maybe singing with them. You could also see many other ladies, who were delivering the handouts/leaflets to the passers-by. They were there, freely singing. That is one thing actually you can see. Yes, we also have house churches, they cannot be open, and they may have to change their way of worshiping. Or maybe they have to worship not as us, openly. So it is a very complicated situation, and it is hard to judge. Or it is hard to teach others how you should worship God in China. Besides, China is a very plural country, very diverse, with many other religions existing for a long time  it has a long history. When you talk with others, who maybe a Buddhist, who may have been a vocal religion believer. you may find a kind of confrontation, especially when you talk with well-educated people in universities, who have some knowledge of other religions. Actually, the more humble you are, the more you show respect to them, the more possibility for you to win their hearts. Better Evangelism in China:It is not right that we judge them very quickly, or you tell them that if you do not believe in Christ, you are going to hell, very quickly. If you are not going to threaten them in that way, but the way you respect them, you listen to their ideas, you respect their previous experiences, their pain, the suffering they had, and how that kind of wisdom has helped them going through all the difficult times. They are still searching and they are still pursuing the truth. You respect them, listen to them, go and see their situation in this way, then, they will listen to you, and also they will come to Christ finally. Because we are only the ones, learning to be the disciples to go and see, and to get the five loaves and the fish back to God, and it is God who is doing the final work, who is doing the miracle, not us. So condescending will never help. Also, remember that, during the service, actually who are the ones whom have been transformed? Us. Not the ones we are actually helping  with. In the process through your helping, you will be transformed. Application:Put God first:I have heard many friends, always telling me some excuses, even once when I was teaching in a seminary. A student was asking for a leave because she was taking an entrance examination for the Masters level. She told me that I have to prepare for my exam, which is coming in three months, so I cannot preach. Do not ask me to preach., I have to prepare for my lessons and my exam. If it was an ordinary person or a common person in the church, I would not say anything, maybe I would just say, OK, maybe we can talk about that; but for seminary students, I became very serious, and stern. Because I could not see that God would be the barrier for the examination or for the things that you want to pursue. Because, why do they learn? They learn to serve God, and they think that examination will be better, or more important than the work for God? Actually, I also talked with many other students who are in the other countries, I said, if you like, you can go to the church. They always said, Oh, yes, because I have an exam, so this Sunday I am not free. But those excuses actually will never work; because you have been working all the time, and you have been studying all the time, going to church actually is a good break. It is God who is always helping you, strengthening you, if you are in a group, serving others, serving God., God is strengthening you through all the things you are doing, and you are the one who will benefit the most.Secondly, to go and see, actually also means the responsibilities, the duties that we Christians carry on ourselves. To go and see the situation, we notice the situation and we know our responsibilities to challenge and to change. Love:For instance, there is one sub-consciousness or a kind of well-known saying in China, that is, there is no unconditional love or hate in this world. () Many people would think this way, if you show your kindness to somebody, you must have some reason. You must have some purpose hidden behind it. Or if you hate somebody, there is also some reason there. So, it is very difficult for the Chinese. to believe there exists this unconditional love, We are very utilitarian, because in Buddhism or other (traditional) religions, we trade with gods: I pay this, I bow at this, I worship this, I follow all the duties, then I should get something back. However, it is our task to challenge this sub-consciousness of unconditional love, as a human being., It is very natural for us to expect something, when you help others. Maybe you do not want something materialized, but at least, you want their respect, you help them, you want their smile or kindness, returning back to you. But sometimes, it may not be the result, you may not get it. When things like that happens, always check, why I expect that, where is my unconditional love, and think about how God gave us this unconditional love. Because we were so bad, we sinned every day, we promised we were not going to sin but we did the same thing again, and God just pardoned us, and loved us first of all, before we even knew God. God is still there, He has been helping us through all kinds of way. And He finally gives us this wisdom in our eyes to see the love of God. And there is one, we all know that in Henan Province actually, many people suffered with HIV, AIDS. And many Christian groups went there and helped them. One of my friends also, whose church organization adopted many orphans and the HIV kids in that village. So he visited them several times. He has to get in touch with the local officials. After many visits, many talks, and finally one day, in the banquet after some alcohol, this official finally loosened himself and talked freely, and he said, I cannot help asking you this, why do you come and help these poor kids. Why, for what purpose? Because there is no unconditional love, just let me know your purpose. And this friend said, But in my mind there is unconditional love and this is what I have experienced. I do not want anything, I just want to help, and I thank you for giving me this opportunity to help. Because you give me this chance to serve, the people behind me, those who are serving the kids, they are very happy, and also they have learnt something, and they are very grateful. And we never let anybody know our church background, and we never tell them we are Christians or from which organization, we just want to help. Go and see:So it is our challenge that we show our unconditional love to others, to embrace them, to be tolerant, to respect them, so that we can show a community of love and a community of unconditional love. In this way we are challenging and transforming this sub-consciences. Go and see, it is a requirement from God; it is a commandment from God for Christians to notice the situation around us, to see the need of the people, and to respond and serve the people like God has done for us. To go and see is also an invitation to you, if you are not a believer yet. It is an invitation from God that you go and see the Christian community. See the people around you who are Christians, so that you can be touched by Gods love. Lets all go and see. May God bless His words. Amen.Go and See10/09/2011                                                                   Cathy ZhangPAGE  PAGE  5Haidian Christian Church                                                                 "
"12","20111016eng","2011-10-16","Pastor Gary","God's Good Gift ","Genesis 2:18-25","Reading Scripture: Genesis 2:18-25 The Lord God said, It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him. Now the Lord had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found. So the Lord caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, He took one of the mans ribs and closed up the place with flesh. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib He had taken out of the man, and He brought her to the man. The man said, This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, for she was taken out of man. For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.SermonBrothers and sisters, yesterday right here, I married three couples. The Saturday before last week, I married another three couples. So how many couples I have married? I dont remember. There are just too many, as a pastor of this beautiful church. But sometimes I wonder: what is the significance? How much do the newlyweb husband and wife understand the significance of marriage? How much do they understand the responsibility that they should have as a husband and a wife? Before the wedding, we give a little bit of counseling over the marriage and the responsibility of being a husband and a wife to the man and the lady who are getting married. But that is not enough. So over the years I have been wanting to have special guests who are specialized in marriage and parenting counseling to come here to bless our young people so that they can be full ready to enter marriage as Christians. That has been my desire and today we are so blessed that we have a special speaker who is also a pastor, Gary., He has been a pastor of a church in southern California, which has two thousand members and it is a very beautiful church. He is together with his wife Elizabeth and also his team. Both of them have been pastors of that church and they have been so committed and devoted to the spiritual growth of the congregation. So lets welcome Pastor Gary to focus next thirty minutes on being a good husband and a good wife. Sermon by Pastor Gary:Well, what a special privilege it is to be here with you this morning and I bring you greetings from your brothers and sisters in Trinity Church in the Redlands, California and we delight to be with you. Our brothers and sisters are just sharing what it means to be part of something bigger, something eternal and something significant--- to be part of the family of God together. So, we are delighted to be here and to be in Haidian Church and to sense this very strategic place that God has given you, not only with this magnificent building and not only the strategic location, but to recognize that the Lord has called you as Christs followers to serve and to be involved in building His Kingdom. Here is the one of the most strategic places of the world. I dont need to tell you that Beijing is one of those places that is not only burgeoning in terms of growth, but also in terms of influence and importance around the world. This is my first visit to China and you come with all kinds of things. I must confess that I see the strength, vibrancy, and the beauty of the city; see not only the heritage as we were in the Forbidden City yesterday, but the newness and freshness. It reminds us that you live in a city, and you live in a culture, a nation that has probably experienced more rapid changes that any other nation and any other country if you think back in the past decades, of this city. What it means for you as Christs followers, not only to see God using you and your own nation and the influence I believe that God is going to give you around the world. It is difficult to be at the front edge of the way and to recognize we are moving into a new world! Are you going to do it effectively? If God is going to use you what He would have to use, it needs to be things that are constant, unchanging, things that are stable., And in the midst of a very changing society that is  anchored  deep, and nothing is more important to Christs followers than the very first institution that God established, marriage and the family. Forthose who are and to be married, what you are doing in your relationship with your husband or your wife., God says its nothing less than the picture of Christ and church, a kind of object lesson that He allows you to show others what it means to be Christs followers. God gives you the blessing of children, then what the great responsibility it is to raise those children and display the instruction of the Lord to pass the torch to the next generation, to the glory of God. Many of you are looking toward marriage or at least wondering what the Lord has that on your screen, on the horizon of your life. Some of you were struggling in marriage, because although nothing is closer to heaven on earth and the wonders as well, nothing is more like the other side of the dimension, more like hell on the earth. Well, it isnt Gods iintention to be. So this is normal that we need to go back and ask what God intended the marriage to be? We can look around the cultures and get the models; I suspect it is largely true in your society as well. The cultural models fail and the place we need to go back is to the word of God and to what God has said and communicated in this word and in this truth. So, this morning, I want to spend most of our time looking at the marriage as God intended it to be. The basic foundational things that are graven in our nature as man and woman and Gods intention as man and woman to come together., That is why we looking at Genesis2., Let me read a few verses again, just to get those words in your mind.Genesis 2:18 It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.Then this paragraph ends with the statement that God brought the man to the woman He had made and the man said at last: Bone of my bones and flesh and my flesh, she shall be called woman for she was taken out of man. Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and holdfast with his wife and they shall become one flesh. And the man and his wife were both naked but they felt no shame.When we get to read the Bible here, we are at the entry point of the BibleGenesis 1, Genesis 2 and Genesis 3 --- the whole Christian worldview. It doesnt make sense apart of how we understand these verses. And I dont need to go back and tell you the story in Genesis 1 that Gods calling creation to being by His power. And then in Genesis 2, He goes back over the same subject. Let me just make a parallel for you. Three years ago, eyes of world were fixed on Beijing because the Olympics were being held. And we celebrated with you and what a great Olympics and Beijing invited the world and celebrated with the world! Theres always a number of storylines and what the storyline at the Olympic Games was the American swimmer Michael Phelps., He was going for 8 gold medals., No athlete had ever won 8 gold medals before and he had already established in the 2004 Olympics a brilliant track record and so he began to swim his races. And there were one gold medal and another gold medal, and the breathtaking almost lost in the relay when somebody else came through. Finally, he won 6 gold medals and the 7th one was going to tie the record. Maybe you still remember and I think it was at the 100m Butterfly Stroke. As he came to the last lap, he was behind., He was not trailed in any other races up until that time and it looked like he was hopelessly behind a Serbian swimmer who was alongside him. But just to see it coming to the end, the Serbian swimmer was gaming with him, and they came to the last stroke., As I watched the TV and the announcers watched the TV: Michael Phelps lost! Came so close but lost and then, the electronic screen came up and he won! I was in defence about what I saw in my eyes but he won by 1/100 of second. What is 1/100 of second? But he won by that, but it wasnt what it seemed. It was protested by the Serbian team and they began to review as you remember as they looking at slides 1/10000 of second apart and they determined in fact that Michael Phelps had won. But it never was a possible mergence and why I tell this story? Because there was a sort of normal sense of reading a story or seeing a story unfold, but it required to close up to make a clue what it really happened. So when we read Genesis 1 as we are taking through day one and day two and we hear God saying it is good, it is good, and it is good. We come to the climax of the chapter when God made the man and woman, the statement now that God makes man and woman in His own image and gave them the commission to go out into the world, it is good, and God said it is very good!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         He said something about the dignity about humanity and the dignity of man and woman, and the responsibility of man and woman., If we only had chapter 1 that we would re-read that story, we would think that  God made man and woman at the same time. Now in chapter 2,  we have the slow motion, and we have the unfolding of how those events came about. As Genesis 2 makes it clear,  it turns out that God didn't make them at the same time. For every other part of the creation as far as we can tell, He spoke and it happened. But God intentionally made man before He made the woman, and as we read Genesis2, we recognized that God created the man and He put him in the perfect environment to enjoy everything that could be enjoyed. God gave him the total permission for eating every tree in this garden, but the tree in the center of the garden. Adam was full of permission, full of provision and in fellowship with God. Thats why its odd if you are listening to the way that the Bible  speaks in Genesis 2:18. We hear God said It is not good. It is not good. Everything elses been good; it is not good that man should be alone. So in verse 18, it condenses into a little statement. we have the statement or the recognition that marriage is the divine provision for our good., It is not good what is God going to do if it is not good that mans alone?It is not good that the man is alone tells us and there are three things I want you to know through this verse. First of all, the creation of the woman, bringing about the marriage; it is for companionship. It is not good for the man to be alone. Then think about that. The man had a perfect environment, and a perfect fellowship with God, but God said no. I made you for more than that, I made you for companionship, for the sharing of life, for the joining in your life with another, but the loneliness is not my intention. I dont misunderstand. If we had time we will dwell on one of the great Biblical truth that Jesus lived as a single person, and a single person is a whole person. And God by his grace comes into the lives of those he called singleness and they dont live handicapped, paralyzed through life. But Gods normal intention for these human beings is to bringing them into companionship, sharing the essence of the marriage. Then God declared something else. If companionship is stated first, he says, I will make a helper. Now that is a remarkable thing, because God is saying I made man, he is in my image, he is my creature, but by my purpose, he isnt adequate as he is. I didnt make him fully self-sufficient; I didnt make him completely adequate. He is dependent on another. I will make a helper. As to this point, we can make a huge mistake, we can say, Well, OK! Then God made woman and woman is mans helper, kind of his servant,  his supporter who is there to help make man what man should be. Part of me likes that idea. But is it what the Bible teaches us? This word helper is a word that the Bible uses to refer to God himself:Psalms 121:1-2, I lift my eyes to the hills Where does my help come from? My help comes from the LordThats the same word help., Helper, is here. Helper is someone who brings strength to the task that you lack. It is used for the military force that comes in behind to back-trace your weakness, so you can know victory when it looks like that you would be defeated. So whats this passage saying? That the woman was created and the marriage was created, so the two people who come with gifts and talents in themselves are not enough by themsleves alone for all Gods intended partnership between the man and woman.. A helper that comes from the partnership that God intendsfor the other, companionship, and help. Then there is something else said, because he said, I will make a helper corresponding to him. (I will make one like himself as a help to him) It is a hard word in Hebrew to  translate, but it has about the idea of corresponding to him. Literally, it is opposite to him. But being opposite is in the sense that they correspond to each other. I mean we understand that men and women correspond physically. The way that God has designed physically is that we fit and we correspond to one another. But this is saying in a deeper level. God intended men and women, made men and women in such a way that the differences we have in genders, the differences we have in our own personal make up for each other. Are the very things that we allow them to work for us rather than against us make us stronger? There is no such thing as a couple, who are ideally suited for one another. One of the great blessings of marriage is to recognize that God makes us different because we need the differences and allow them to work together to make us stronger. So God Himself just said the words given in the text., The divine provision for marriage for our good is related to our need for companionship, our need for help, our need for corresponding and building into our lives. So thats said, I would expect the story  unraveling something like this, God brought a woman to the man. You remember the story that is a kind of unusual story that God didnt do it at all, instead he created animals to Adam, and Adam was given the responsibility of naming them and recognizing them. And why was God doing this, well the text gave us a clue. It says, in all of these, there is not a helper corresponding to him. Adam saw all of the creation and he recognized thats outside of him. Thats different from him. And then God put him to sleep. Still alone, still without a helper, still without someone who corresponds (who is like himself) to him. And then you remember this, God performed, a strange and mysterious operation on Adam, and woke Adam up. And then the first thing was God brought the woman to his eyes. And the Hebrew text doesnt quite say that. But the response was Wow. Everything else had been out there. At last, there is immediately a recognition that she corresponds to him ; she resonates with him ; bone of his bones; flesh of his flesh. And there is a  recognition that  shares a common divine image. She shall be called woman for she was taken from man., Listen to it in the Hebrew. You can hear the connection that she shall be called ishshah (meaning from man) for she was taken from ish . Name the animals he gave them their names, he gave the woman his name, in the sense of closeness, intimacy and oneness of that. Notice in verse 24, the second thing, that marriage has a divine pattern for our good. Here is what God intended. In Matthew 19:14-15, Jesus quoted this verse. The Jewish religious leaders at the time, the Pharisees, were talking about the divorce. Jesus looked at the Jewish leaders,and said, Havent you read that at the beginning the Creator made the male and female, and said, for this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and shall holdfast, cling to his wife, and two shall become into one flesh. So it is God whos speaking in the verse 24. All of the Scriptures are Gods Words, but these are Gods words in the sense that Hes spoken. This is His pronouncement to the essence of marriage., You notice that it is   built through three verbs: Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave (hold fast) unto his wife: and they shall become one flesh., translated in all that ways to his wife, two shall become one flesh. Leaving, holding fast, and becoming. These verbs tell us three important things. The first is that marriage creates new loyalty. Man shall leave his father and his mother. Now remember this is Gods word and Gods word commands us, Honor your father and your mother (Exodus 20:12). There is nothing in the Bible minimizing the place, respect and support of the parents. But there is a powerful Biblical statement that says when I take on a wife; I have a new priority in my life; I have a new centralloyalty in my life; I have a higher claim in my life. And that is my wife. She now is more significant to me than any other relationships that I have. That is true even when I have children. My highest responsibility is to love my wife and I deeply love my children and my grandchildren. But I didnt commit when I got them as children to cling to them for the rest of my life. They might be a resource of happiness but when time is right, you need to let them go. But I said to Elizabeth, I will love you, and be a loyal HYPERLINK ""javascript:void(0)""husbandto you until death does us apart. So when you get into a marriage relationship, you are into a commitment, to your husband and to your wife that transcends any other loyalty you have in your life except your loyalty to God Himself. The second statement is that a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall holdfast or cling unto his wife. To hold fast or cling unto is an interesting word in the Hebrew language to express sticking like a glue. It is a word of covenant, It is a word of commitment; It is a word for a story that you heard in the story about Ruth who was returning back to Israel land. Her mother-in-law, Naomi said, Go back, go back.  (Ruth 1:8) Orpah went back but Ruth clung to her, stuck to her: My people will be your people; my God will be your God (Ruth 1:16).  Marriage is not a contract. What I mean by that is this contract is based on exchanging services. In my life, I have contracts with different kinds of people; I pay you a certain amount of money so that you delivery newspaper to me in a particular time, and as long as you do your  job and I pay my money following our contract. But a contract  can be broken; its based on exchanging services. When I married Elizabethan I did not say to her I take you as my laundress, as my cook, as my sex partner. I did not have a contract with her. It stood with words with our human tradition but it is biblically true. I Gary take you Elizabeth. I give myself to her and its a covenant and a commitment. And so the traditional statement says what God has put forth what Jesus himself said about marriage (Matthew 19:14-15) is true, that marriage is a covenant and commitment. The core of my being is that I not only declare a new loyalty but I made a new commitment to my wife and we become one flesh. The Bible uses that language to describe sexual relations and so the husband and the wife  become one flesh and you notice that the picture in the Bible and it goes on in the next verse that two were naked before one another unashamed. There is nothing embarrassed in the Bible about sexuality, it is a good gift from God to be enjoyed and to be delighted and becoming one flesh is a physical intimacy and God intended the sexual relationship to take place within the commitment and covenant of marriage, not before it but within it. The marriage is a way of building those bounds that result from leaving and clinging. But becoming one flesh physically is just part of the process of becoming one in a deep level--intimacy. Gods goal of marriage is that we share our life and share our hearts and we share things that matter most so we build a commitment and connection to one another. So we notice the divine provision for marriage is for companionship and for help and for complimenting one another, not saying nice things but  joining each other together. Notice that Gods pattern for marriage is a new royalty that transcends one another; it is a covenant commitment that sticks like a glue. It is becoming a sharing, a giving-away of life, symbolizing that expresses physically and enter into a large ring of our life. Marriage is what God intended and that beautiful picture of how God intended our life to be, naked and unashamed before one another. Does the marriage only end there? It doesnt. Before we finish the Genesis 3, everything had changed. Man and woman were angry and blaming one another and having Gods judgment upon them walking out of the garden, dressed in clothes because Gods grace is stripped away, and its a pretense when they walked before one another. If we have time we will have to see how Genesis 3 says, but it is critical to see what happened in Genesis 3: the man and woman turned their back on God and they defied the one command that God had given. They tracked all the way what had happened but theres essence in it and the very moment they broke their relationship with God, the Bilbe  says they saw themselves being naked. Were we naked before? Shame and guilt and then they are covered. Who was the covering from? Covering from one another, they began to blame one another. The man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me the fruit of the tree and I took it. (Genesis 3:12) Woman, you gave me. She made me eat it. Then they blamed God. As God appeared, they hid from him. The story of marriage is that of sinners marriage and sins marriage--the very things that wants us to come together. I am from Canada and I tell you a story of Canada about pork pies from the widows of winter. The windows get cold and come together for warmth. When they come together for warmth, they can stick to each other so they spare apart. It is a great picture of marriage between two sinners, in that we need each other and yet we stick to each other all the time, and we also pull each other apart. So here is the third thing for marriage. Marriage is not only a divine provision for our good, it needs a divine partner for our good. In the midst of that story. human beings were turning away from God. Thus, marriage is a promise that God is going to redeem, rebuild and restore. It is a line that runs through the Bible until Jesus the Son of God came to human flesh and live on earth. It is the Gods Son who goes to the Cross and dies on the Cross taking our sin and our guilt. So when our shame came, it could be turned into forgiveness from God Himself. So the guilt that makes me blame my partner can be washed away and I can begin to accept my own sinfulness and realize that God loves me even in the midst of this. And He forgives me and then God in His grace through the death of Christ on the Cross rises from the death and comes to live in those who put his faith and trust in Him by the power of Holy Spirit so that I can begin to live out what God calls me to do. So when God speaks to the husbands and wives in the New Testament, He doesnt turn back and doesnt ask us to  remember what Adam was like. He doesnt say to remember what Eve was like? He points to husbands and says husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church(Ephesians 5:25) .   He says to wives in 1 Peter 1:21, Christ died for you leaving you an example and you should follow in His steps, and  in that way, He says in 1 Peter 3:1, Relate to your husband.   You see that marriage in the sinful broken world needs a divine person at the center and that person is the Lord Jesus and it is not enough that we say yes I am Christs follower. What is required is that it is very hard for our relation with our marriage partner. It is planted the Cross of Lord Jesus Christ. Realizing that God deals this by grace, we need to live with our marriage partner by grace for His glory. You need the Cross and  I need the Cross, not only for salvation but also in living out our marriage in the way that pleases and honors our Lord Jesus Christ. If you are married this morning, the strength and healing come from this Cross. If you are not married this morning let me tell you one of the reasons that the Bible commands Christs followers not to marry those who are not Christs followers is because you cannot put the Cross as the center of your marriage and you are like the central thing that keeps you from  moving forward. As you move towards marriage and you look for someone to whom you want to give your life and we show the central thing is that do we know the gospel? Are we living the gospel in our relationship to one another for the glory of God? Maybe God will never call you to marry, but your need is the same and that is, to live the Cross and to find the power that God gives us to live our life in ways to honor and please Him and to fulfill us. So as we close in prayer, let et me invite you to the Cross and to the Christ who loved us and gave himself for us. Maybe you never trusted Christ. As I pray, you can pray, opening your heart to what you know of him. So Father thank you ,thank you that you loved us and you made marriage for our good and you gave us your words to teach us about the essence of marriage. But in our brokenness and falling, we need more of your instruction and we need your salvation and we need your enablement and we need your help so whatever our relationship is before you this morning, help us to see at the Cross your love for us, to trust you, to receive your love so that out of our inner most being, we flow rivers of living waters to others for your glory ,especially to our partners .We pray in Christs name. Amen.God's Good Gift10/16/2011                                                              Pastor Wu & Pastor GaryPAGE  PAGE  8Haidian Christian Church                                                                 "

Lets welcome him.Sermon:Brothers and Sisters, as you have already seen, and experienced for this morning, worship is vitally important to us. Worship is vitally important to us, because when we praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, when we worship Him, when we are in worship of Him, when we give thanks to Him in all circumstances. Here comes the reign of the Lord, and here comes the grace of Jesus Christ, here comes the power of the Lord Jesus Christ. So this morning I give thanks not only to God, but also to the servants of worship leaders for this morning.And brothers and sisters, two days ago, November 11th is a special day, all people who are single, on that day, singles, single people were supposed to get together, not to celebrate but to mourn the fact that they are not married yet. But brothers and sisters, let me assure you, if you are a child of the Lord, if you are coming to church to worship the Lord, you will never be alone, because the things you mourn as a single person is that nobody cares about you, nobody cares for you when you feel so lonely. But brothers and sisters, if you are a child of God, if you are a Christian, you are always and all the time in the care of Christian brothers and sisters, and most importantly, you are always in the care of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is walking with you, and He was, and He is, and He always walks with you, because He is the Lord, His heart is full of love and He cares about you, and He is ready to walk with you, and He is ready to care and love you.In Psalm 50:14-15, the Bible tells us,Sacrifice thank - offering to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High, and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me.So you see, in verse 14, the Bible here talks about offerings. In November every year, Haidian Church decided, a few years ago, to focus all the services of November on giving thanks to our Lord. Maybe you have seen that  some foods, some fruits, and oil and some other stuff are there. Why do you think they are there? Because people want to bring the first fruit of their grain, honey, oil or other things to the church to give thanks to the Lord. So in Psalm 50, the Bible talks about offerings. I have been a pastor for 18 years, I have read the Bible many times, so all the years I have come to an understanding that there are three types of, or there are three kinds of offerings, sacrifices. First kind of offerings: Animal sacrifices in the Old testament timesThe first kind is the things that you see over there.. The first kind of offerings or sacrifices that people bring to the Lord are things like we were told in the Old Testament, like a bull, oxen, ram or lamb. People in the Old Testament times, one day, they would sacrifice or offer this to the temple, or to the tabernacle. They brought this to the Levites, that they slaughtered these and burnt the things on the altar, so that the relationship of Israelites and God could be restored; so that the heart of thanksgiving of people could be expressed toward our Lord. So that is one type, that is one kind of offerings that people brought to God.In 2 Chronicles chapter 31, the Bible tells us a king of Israeli by the name of Hezekiah,""Hezekiah assigned the priests and Levites to divisions each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, to minister, to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the LORD's dwelling. The king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons and appointed feasts as written in the Law of the LORD. He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and Levites so that they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD. As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount, a tithe of everything. The men of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the LORD their God, and they piled them in heaps."" (2 Chronicles 31:2-6)In verse 20-21,This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and right and faithful before the Lord his God. In everything that he undertook in the service of Gods temple and in obedience to the law and the commands, he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.So Hezekiah prospered by giving offerings, by sacrificing offerings to God. This king prospered. So you see, brothers and sisters, giving offerings or sacrifices to God is vitally important. Because it not only brings Israelites to the presence of God so that their sins can be forgiven by God, but also they can get favor from our heavenly king and they can prosper. But let me tell you, even though in the Old Testament times, even though Israelites sacrificed a lot of rams, a lot of bulls, a lot of lambs, they still continued to sin. They sinned against God, they worshiped other gods, they followed the teaching of other gods, that our Lord, our God disliked their offering. That is why, in minor prophet Micah 6:7-8, God said to Israelites through His prophet,Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I offer my firstborn form my   transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul, He has showed you, oh, man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.Because even though Israelites continued to offer so many rams and bulls and had them burnt on the altar, they continued to sin, their relationship with God was cut off. So that is why, even though they offered so many rams and bulls, they still did not have favor, they could not be saved by what they did, by the offering that they sacrificed.Second kind of offering: Jesus death on the cross for our sinSo now we come to the second offering, the second sacrifice and that I have come to understand, that I have come to embrace, which is Jesus Christ. If you see, in the Old Testament times, rams and bulls or lambs were all the offerings that people brought to the presence of Lord, to the altar. And Jesus came,  and He was that offering that our God, our heavenly Father put on the altar to be sacrificed for our sins once for all. And He was put on the cross to die, just for one time and our relationship with God be restored. Because He is the sacrifice that our God sacrificed for our sins, just once for all. Because the Bible, in Hebrew 13:12, tells us, And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through His own blood.Hebrew 10:10, And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.And today we do not have to bring a ram or a bull. You know how big the bull is? I cannot imagine how many bulls the church can store. I cannot imagine. Today we do not have to bring a bull, a ram, a pigeon or a dove to the church to be slaughtered and to be burnt on the altar so that our relationship with God can be restored. And today we do not have to do that. All we need to do is to come to the presence of Jesus Christ, to confess our sins, to receive Him and accept Him as our Lord and Savior. That is all that takes to become a follower of Jesus, and to be saved by our Heavenly Father. And because of that, the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross, we as Christians should on each day and every single day and in all circumstances give thanks to our Lord. Because that praise, that thank we give each day to our Lord in all circumstances is the third kind of offering that we should bring to the presence of the Lord everyday. That is the third kind of offering that we Christians should make. Third kind of offering: Christians thanksgiving and living sacrificeIn Psalm 50:14, the Bible tells us,Sacrifice thank  offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High. Because that is the vow you made in your life before God, you need to do that, you need to sacrifice thank  offering to God everyday and in all circumstances. Because the Bible also tells us and requires of us in Psalm 100:1-5,Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth. Worship the Lord with gladness; come before Him with joyful songs. Know that the Lord is God. It is He who made us, and we are His; we are His people, the sheep of His pasture. Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks to Him and praise His name. For the Lord is good and His love endures forever; His faithfulness continues through all generations.In Thessalonians5:16-18, Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.Giving thanks to the Lord is not something you do with your own accord, but also something the Lord requires of you to do and Lord commands you to do, so long as you are a Christian, so long as you are a follower of Jesus Christ. In Luke 17, when Jesus was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met Him. They stood at a distance and called out in loud voice, Jesus, master, have pity on us! When Jesus saw them, He said, Go show yourselves to priests.And as they went, they were cleansed. One of them, when he saw he was healed, he came back praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself at Jesus feet and thanked Him. Lets us what followed. Jesus asked,Were not all ten cleansed? Why only you came back to throw yourself at my feet and give thanks? Why? Where are the other  nine? Jesus intended all of them to come back, to give thanks so that not only the physical problems can be healed, but also the spiritual relationship of people with God can be restored. And Jesus considers that more vital and more important than physical healing. So, giving thanks to our Lord is a requirement of a Christian, it is a requirement commanded by the Lord. So brothers and sisters, we should give thanks everyday and in all circumstances. I remember a story. A man was building a house. And he was sitting on the roof, knocking a nail. But carelessly, because his arm grew so tired, he could not hold very tightly of his hammer, and the hammer just all the way fell down the floor. And there was another person working on something else on the floor downstairs. And the hammer just hit his feet! As the hammer hit his feet, the person screamed, Praise the Lord, thank you Lord! And the person who was knocking the nail up on the roof asked him, I am so sorry! I am so sorry! But let me ask you, why did you give thanks to the Lord?Because your hammer hit my feet, rather than my head.So, brothers and sisters, we should give thanks in all circumstances, even in miserable situation, because that is a requirement of a Christian, because that is a requirement commanded by our Lord Jesus. Because if you do that, God will prosper your life, God will make you prosperous.In Job, chapter one, lets look at how Job gives thanks in all circumstances. In Job 1:13, the Bible tells us:13 One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,    14 a messenger came to Job and said, The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,    15 and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!    16 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!    17 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!    18 While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,    19 when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!Within about half an hour, less than half an hour, Jobs servants, all of them, almost all of them, were put to death, were slaughtered. All the lambs, the sheeps of Job were taken away; all the camels were taken away. And children, who were considered the honour of people in ancient Israel, also all died. It was considered a shame on Job. But lets look at what kind of reaction Job had for what happened to him.At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worshipand said:   Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I shall depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised. (Job 1:20-21)Let the name of the Lord, who has caused all of these bad things to happen to him, be praised! You see, brothers and sisters, Job is a great example for us because he gives thanks in all circumstances.There are three kinds of offerings. One, in ancient times, Israelites brought offerings to the temple, or the tabernacle, or the altar, so that these offerings can be slaughtered or burnt on the altar. This is the first. And second, Jesus Christ, our Lord, our Gods only begotten Son, and our God sent Him down to this earth so that He could be put onto the cross and die for us once for all, and we can enjoy the fellowship with our heavenly king. That is the second type of offering that God set up. And third, brothers and sisters, I urge you that we should give thanks, each and every single day, and in all circumstances, so that our God could make our spiritual and physical lives prosper, in Jesus name, Amen.Transcribed by Esther, Franz and Shirley with the strength, love, grace and peace from our God.Give Thanks in All Circumstances13.11.2011                                                                           Pastor WuPAGE  PAGE  6Haidian Christian ChurchSin =sinful nature;Sins = sinful actions"

And in these last days, you have spoken to us through your beloved son, our Lord Jesus Christ. He is the exact representation of Your Being. He is the radiance of Your Glory.

We worship you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.Happy Thanksgiving! Im very thankful that I can be with you today. Im very thankful for God, and for who He is, and for all that He has done. I am very thankful for you, my brothers and sisters. Im very thankful for each and everyone of you. Because Jesus Christ died for you. And He loves you infinitely and unconditionally. And I thank God for the very breath that I take. Now you may be wondering, breath? But I breathe all the time. Why would you thank God for your breath? Well, when you dont have something, the value appreciates. One of my friends, he and I were swimming in the ocean. It was a quiet day. And nothing seemed very unspectacular about the ocean. It was quiet and calm. And then all of sudden, my friend was caught by a tide, and the current just dragged him down, all of sudden; he had to hold on to his breath as the current took him down lower and lower. And you can imagine the thoughts that he had on his mind. This may be my last breath. God was good. And my friend still lives. And he shared with me. How he appreciates the value of every breath that he takes. So I appreciate the value of breath too. (ah, ahbreathe deeply) Thank you God for the breath of life. So Im very thankful.Today we are in the Psalms. There are 150 Psalms. So its a very long book. But its a beautiful book. In the Psalms, we have a number of writers. Probably about half of them are attributedto King David, and are  about his life, or inspired by him, or written by him. About a dozen of them are written or attributed to Asaph who is one of the men who served King David.And then we have 37 of them that were written by somebody whose name shows up  a lot in  the literature, author unknown.But you know we dont have to worry about His identity, because you and I know who it is? Right, the author is the Holy Spirit Himself. So we have the source, the truth coming directly from heaven to us, to our hearts.Ok, there are several types of Psalms. There are worship Psalms; there are wisdom Psalms; there are Psalms of sadness; there are Psalms that are liturgical for the temple and for the kings. And then there are Psalms of thanksgiving. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! This category is the Psalm category that we are in; we are going to be thanking God for creation, for salvation and for His remembering love. But this is primarilyabout Israels hymn book. Its about hymn. And who is the hymn? The hymn is Jesus. This book tells us about his divine sonship, tells us about his seal for Fathers house. It tells us about His passion, His crucifixion; it tells us about His resurrection on the third day; it tells us about His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His ultimate glorification as eternal priest, and eternal King. This is about Him. And so we are going to learn about Him. Ok, our keywords for our passage today. There are 26 verses. So its not surprising that we will see His love endures forever 26 times. Giving thanks explicitly appears 4 times. But it could be inferred many times as many times as the verses appear. We also see there are kings, King Jesus, as well as the king, of the earth, a God who does great wonders. And people who think they are great and then of course the object of love, the people of Israel.Ok our divisions are three, and alluded to them, Gods creative love, Gods redemptive love, and Gods remembering love.1. Gods creative love.Lets dive from the first verse. And it says here Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good. His love endures forever. The first thing we notice is that its Lord, Yahweh, His covenant name. The God almighty says, I would like to make you a special person in my relationship. I want you to be my friend. I want you to be part of my family. Now usually when we meet perhaps celebrities, you know the NBA stars, or when we meet some very rich affluent people. How many of them will say, I would like to make a covenant with you. I want to become your friend, and you become my friend. How many? Well, we know that the most important person of the whole world, God, He says I want to be your friend, and I want you to be my friend. Me? Me? Who am I? says the psalmist. That you should be mindful of me. OK. He also says that He is good. Jesus said no one is good.Wait a minute. I didnt commit any crime. Look, the police had no record on me. We didnt commit any crime against the law of this country. But what about the Law of God? Well, I am ok. I am ok. People like me, and I am ok. I am sorry, that is not enough. You want me to be perfect? Yes, you have to be perfect. But no one is perfect! And thats the problem. Oh I see, God is perfect and for us to have a friendship, we have to be perfect too. But thats impossible. No one is perfect. How can we be perfect? And God said I have a solution for you--my son. And by His blood, by His sacrifice, by His grace, you can be made perfect with His righteousness. Really? For me, for you. Wow. OK. You must think quite highly of me. No matter. will try to understand this. I will try to accept this. Its quite overwhelming, I would say.. Ok, He says, in the next verse, Give thanks to the God of gods, He says in the past, you may have worshiped other things. You may have worshiped idols. Well, I dont kneel down to statues. Look,  if you come to my home, I dont have statues. And God says Its not those types of idols necessarily I am concerned about, I am concerned about the idols of popularities, the idols of self, the idols of prestige, prosperity, the idols of the things of this world. You love the world too much, Stephen. I thought you made this world, so could I love it a little bit? Well you know Stephen; I love you with everything that I am. But you just love me a tiny mini bit but you love the world a lot.I see, I get the picture, so you want more love, well how about if I give you half of my day. Is that ok? Thats ok right? Its more than what I am already giving you, Right? You want my whole day? You want my whole week? You want my whole life? But is that too much to ask? Oh I see, you give me your Son. You did not withhold anything from me, I think you are reasonable, God. OK. I desire to withhold nothing from you, all my gods, all my idols, including myself, the self that I worship. I'm going to release them, I'm going to place them before you, and I'm going to forsake them. I hate them just as much as you do.OK, the next verse goes on to say: He is the God of wonders. Give thanks to the Lord for His wonders. We know that in the Old Testament, Isaiah tells us that He is a wonderful Counselor. A God who does wonderful things and His wonders last. Other things that people do will not last. They may deceive you or they may thrill you for a short time. But God's wonders they satisfy and they endure. He goes on and then to say: OK, you want to know why I am ,so wonderful? Here is why, By His understanding, He made the heavens. Are you impressed by the heavens? Do you take the time to look up at the heavens? Do you take the time and say: Wow! That is a beautiful cloud! Wow, the color of the sky is so amazing! Wow, the sunsets and sunrises...God has painted the heavens with his own finger for your enjoyment. Wow, that is better than any blockbuster or DVD/movie I have seen. It changes and it amazes me and fascinates me, and I can't stop watching. Wow, you are a wonderful God! You think that is wonderful He says: I'm the one who spreads the earth upon the waters. Just like how may spread a blanket upon your bed. Its all my Mighty Power: I spread out the earth upon the waters. The earth rises above the waters and the most beautiful mountains, the most gorgeous jungles, valleys and landscapes, all created by our artistic and creative God. You know God was very happy by Himself, but it was love that drove Him to create you and I, and it was His love that drove Him to the world around us, for your enjoyment and pleasure, to thrill you and to give you a life more abundant. So then He says ok, you may think that heavens and earth were pretty spectacular, what about the lights and the sky, the sun, how big how large how bright! And what about the stars? We are just blown away, year after year, by the discovery of so many stars. Amazing! Amazing! So many billions of stars and God says: I number them and I name them, I know them all. You know all those billions of stars? Wow!And you know He knows each one of us, billions of us, through the centuries, He knows each one of us, He knows our names, He knows our hearts and He knows the numbers of hairs on our heads. Thats how important you are!! That is how treasured and how precious you are to God. Wow, You are a wonderful God, You do make me wonder, and I am fascinated by You God. So Id like to move on a principle for this, it is very, very simple. It says : All things were created by Him and for Him. He says I am the Creatorhave no doubt about that, just look at my creation, its perfection. You can see that is all by my design. Whats the purpose of my life? Why did I create you? To bear my image. So you mean I am not created to live for myself? For my own dreams, my own desires and ambitions? No, you and I have been created for Him. Ok let me try to digest that a little bit. The question I have for you is we know He is a wonderful Creator, so how knowing that He created us to bear His image, how is that going to change your life from now on? Well I want you and I to read a prayer together.The next line tells us how to respond to this Creator God--in adoration, in confession, in thanksgiving and in prayer. So lets read it together: Adore God for creating everything from nothing, confess any tendency to worship the created, thank God for sustaining you everyday, pray to God to increase your desire to bless others. As He has created and blessed you, you too would bear His image and be a channel of blessing to others, sustaining them by sharing the Word of God and then showing them how wonderful His creation is by the way that you live. 2. Gods redemptive love.We are going to read here: God in history. God controls creation and we understand that but maybe He is not involved in history? And God says I control the heavens, I control the earth, I control the depth of the sea, I am also very involved in history! Well really? Lets see what He did in history. He redeemed His people from Egypt. They had been slaves for 400 years. And here  we have in one corner of the match, we have a 400-year reigning championEgypt. And the next corner, we have the 400-year loserIsrael. Who will win this match? Egypt? 400-year winning record or Israel? 400-year losing record. Who is going to win? Well we know the end of the story, dont we? That against all odds, no one is match to God. If God is on your side, even someone with 400-year winning record cannot match you!! No one can stand against God, no one can win against God, and He has a 100% wining record. I am so glad because I have a losing record, I have been a slave to sin for so many years, and you think that I can get rid of the sins? He says yes! But I have the addiction, I have this weakness, I have this tendency, these bad habits He says no problem, I can help you with that. No matter what enslaves you, I can redeem you. Well I am glad to hear that because I have a big problemsin. He says no problem, I will redeem you from your sins. Not only will I redeem your sins, but also I will take you away from the sins as far as the east from the west. Thank you!Not only does He deliver us from our sins, we must then have a better rest now, right? After our life getting rid of the slavery of sin, life will get really well. Life is going to be smooth and prosperous and happy, right? Lets see what happens in the next verse: He divided the Red sea asunder. So He delivers me out of  the slavery, but He gives me another problem: My enemy would be pursuing me and I was escaping, and then unfortunately, when I came to where I thought I  would escape to , it was the Red Sea! What I am going to do now? I thought life will be filled with open doors, I thought that once I became a Christian, and He saved me, every door is going to be open. Now He closes my way with a Red Sea! But just at the right time, God opens the Red Sea asunder! And He allows people to get through. That was a close shave, a great escape. Now life is going to get better right? Do you know what happens? We end up in the desert! He says in the next verse: He led His people through the desert. So I escape from slavery, I get through the Red Sea, and now I have to face a desert                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        where there is nothing!! I thought life is supposed to be easy! Well, He provided everything they needed during the 40 years in the desert: A pillar of cloud during the day to shade them from the heat; a pillar of fire to warm them during the night and to give them light. He gave them food everyday; He fed them and protected them. And that was not all. He sustained them by His living Word. Things are going to get better now? Not quite! We have to face Kings now. We reached the promise land, and now we get to face the great kings. In fact, these great kings were mighty kings, cruel kings, these kings were like giants!! We are locusts.and they are giants!! We cant do this, Lets go back to Egypt! Lets go back; its easier to be slaves of sin! Those giants are too big! Too mighty! Too tall! Too strong! I am too weak, I am too small!And God says I will provide you with victory and that what He does. He triumphs over all these might giants. So, you think your life is full of problems. Challengers are too tall, seas are too wide and too deep, you think your life is full of difficulty. Well, starkly, the people of God have had lots of problems, many problems, but you know what was so neat,God was with them through all. Even if you are not a Christian, you would have problems too, you would have the same problems that we have, maybe even more severe problems. But you know what the redeeming factor is that we have God, the God of the universe, the creator of the universe, the redeemer of mankind, with us. So if  you dont know the savior, today is the day that His voice is speaking to your hearts. Come, you are welcome to come to my wedding, wedding, it is a fantastic event, the church and my Son, we are going to be together forever.  OK, so lets move then to our principle for this section here. Its one about faith, because life is a journey and the only way we can journey is with faith. The principle says faith knows not where it is being led, but faith knows and loves the One who is leading. So you may think ever since I became a Christian, I thought everything was going to be clearer. Everything will be more adventurous, more exciting, more thrilling. If you are not a Christian, your life will be boring. But as a Christian, your life will be full of adventure, because there are so many unknowns, so many unknowns. But the neat thing is that we get to love the One who is leading us, step by step by step, and that is the fulfillment in itself. As we journey through the wilderness, through the desert, through the tall giants through the Red Seas, we get to walk hand in hand with our beloved One.So the question is how should you respond to Gods Redeeming Love? So I like to read together our ACTP: Adore God for His Almighty Power to save. Confess whatever keeps you from trusting Him. Thank God for His Perfect plans. Pray to God to increase your faith and your obedience. No matter what happens, no matter what is severe or difficult, know He is your redeemer and deliverer. Life may not get smoother, but life will get thicker and richer, more meaningful, more purposeful, and thats what you want. You dont want to live a life that is superficial and full of mediocrity; you want to live in the thicker of things, in the midst of His perfect will.3. Gods remembering love. This is just so exciting; because it says in the next verse that give thanks to the One who remembered us in our lower state. I love that verse because it reminds me of what Mary said when she received the news of coming Lord Jesus Christ through her. She said that He has remembered me in my lower state. You know when you are down and out, people may step on you, and people may kick you, or may not see you any more. But when you are down and out, God says Im here to pick you up, Im here to dust you off, Im here to clean you up, Im here to make you a brand new, Im here to give you another chance, Im here to be with you through it all to the end. He didnt say, go to the desert and Ill see you at the next end. He walks with us, He walks with them, and He walks with us to the end. Then He says what does He do? He frees us from those enemies, He gives food to satisfy us, and at the end, to give thanks to the God of Heaven, His love endures forever. He says at the end of this long hard difficult journey is Heaven, a place where my son has gone ahead to prepare for you. So that where He is, we shall be also. A place that is filled with light, --the light of the glory of God. There wont be any need for the sun or moon; its just the light of glory of the Lamb, the regions of the Fathers glory. The exact representation of His being, you want to know God? Then get to know Jesus Christ. So principle here very simply is: There is no lost time waiting on Gods ways, for we progress the most in His delays. Essentially, God knows the right time for everything, God has the best plans for everything. So when things dont fit in, when things dont work the way you want, just wait on Him. Just say: I dont understand and I cant see exactly where I am going, but Im going to trust in you. What I want to share with you then is this question: If it is so important to know our God is our Creator, our Redeemer, and our Rememberer, how can we keep our relationship with Him growing? How can you keep growing in your relationship with Him? I like to share some thoughts with you, the next line we will give you a better idea. Lets read together such beautiful words: Psalm 37:4-5 Delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the Lord, and trust in Him.If you want to be on fire for Jesus Christ, if you want to never drift away from Jesus, if you want to be excited about Jesus, if you want your love to be burning a high pitch with Jesus, delight in Him, delight in Him, making your joy, delight in Him, find your satisfaction in Him, and in Him alone. He is God, He created you, He redeemed you, and He wants you to be His child, you are His precious possession. He gave them the land and the heritance, and He says I not only saved you but Ive riches untold to bless you with through our Lord Jesus Christ, and because I love you, my creature, because I love you, my redeemed child. I want to lavish my love upon you, but for you to enter the rest, for you to enter the relationship; I want you to commit your life to Jesus Christ, my Son, the final Word, the final revelation of all truth for salvation. If you dont know how to commit your life to Christ, speak to someone besides you. I want to just provide you very quickly some piece to help you study the Psalms more meaningfully. One of my friends told me that she has been studying the Psalms for over twenty years, and she has found it transformed her life; she has really inspired me and challenged me. When you pick up the Psalms, (this is I would like to remember, Im going to read for you now, you can always get on the website.) What I want to share with you is sometimes you ask people how you are doing. OK, great, I guess. People, children of God, we ought to be the happiest people on earth, because we have so much to thank God for. You know my life is not perfect, far from perfect. There are many things that have not gone my way, there are many disappointments and discouragements. But I ask myself what I am thankful for? Absolutely, I am thankful for God being my creator, my redeemer, and one who remembers me. Absolutely those are superiorly important. You know that I also thank God for His provision of my family, as we are far away from home. God provide me with them, my wife and children. And you know, whether Im up or down, whether Im strong or weak, whether Im laughing or crying, God has given me my wife and children, who hug me and hold my hand and tell me they love me because of Jesus Christ. And you know, on the days I was really down, they just go to the piano singing and singing, worshiping and worshiping, and we felt that we were heaven again, heaven on earth. I pray this thanksgiving season, each of you be filled with joy of the Lord, He will be your strength. He will fill your heart and your home with His glory, and He will fill this land of China, with the knowledge of Himself. To God be all glory. Happy Thanks giving.

Scripture Reading:Philemon 1:6I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ. MCs Introduction:It is our pleasure to invite a pastor, Andrew Palau, to join us, to give us a message. He and his father, Luis Palau, they always organize big events and bring people to Christ. Andrew is an evangelist. His father and he are great soldiers of God. We want to welcome him to give us his message.Sermon:Greetings:Thank you, Brother Larry. Did I turn my thing on? Is it OK? (Yes, it is on.) I can hear you. What a privilege to be with you today. I forgot there is no translation now. I will say this, Zhe zhen shi mei hao! (This is wonderful!) Its OK? I have a long way to go but I am practicing. Some day my Chinese will be good. And I am glad to speak to you. My name is Andrew Palau. And I bring greetings from my father, Luis Palau.  Hello, hello. That will work. Ill hold it here. Amen? (Amen.) I am sorry. Well, we had a beautiful service this morning before you came. But this looks like a very special service today. Amen? (Amen.)

Congratulations, Jessica and Dong Li! We will pray for your life together and your service in honoring the Lord in your marriage and in your ministry.I bring greetings from Beaverton, Oregon. Thats where our family and our ministry  are. Our ministry , you may recognize, is a sister, one of your many partners and sister churches from around the world, one of them is in Beaverton. And my friend Mark has made the introduction to Pastor Peter. And we felt like we are new friends, and we look forward to great days of ministry together. Three of your friends are over in Beaverton right now. We bring greetings from Rachel  He ,  Liyu Yang and Gloria Li who are spending some time with us in Beaverton. So its like an exchange program. They are there and I am here. I am so happy. Scripture Sharing:This morning, we realize that all around the world, Gods people are gathering, and worshiping the Lord. Its my privilege to be with you worshiping on this day. It is special to be back in China in the Christmas season. Its beautiful to think of the work of God in these days, celebrating Christmas, that beautiful gift of God, sending His son, Jesus into the world. This Advent season is my very favorite. I am glad to be with you here. So between the wedding and the Advent season, we have much to celebrate. The verse that we read, Philemon verse 6, Ill just leave it with you as an encouragement and a challenge to just continue the incredible work that is already going on here. Even in my short time here, I sense a great move of the Holy Spirit of God, through Haidian Church and through each one of you. This verse, I hope, will stimulate you to continue to work, to serve, and to love the people that He has brought into your life. Look at what it says. I wont expound on it today because I think it is very clear. Even as you live your life, you can understand the depth of this verse for yourself as He reveals Himself to you. I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ. And even though we should share the good news and be active in sharing our faith just out of obedience to the master, right? We should just be active in sharing our faith out of obedience, simple obedience to our Savior. Look at what he says, because He is so good. He says this to us, not only do it because Ive asked you to, but I want you to know that when you live life this way, its for your own good, it is for your own good. As you live and serve in the way that I have created you, it will come around and it will prove to fill your life with good things and with full understanding of all the good things you have in Jesus Christ. And if you just study your life, you will see how that comes to pass day by day. I am grateful that people took that verse seriously, and that they live their life actively sharing their faith. And that is what I really wanted to share with you this morning. We decided that if I could just share a little bit about my story, which might encourage you and challenge you about your activity, and especially that you may never give up praying for your friends and inviting them to know Jesus Christ. That just means actively sharing your faith.Testimony:Because I was born and raised in a great Christian home and my parents were in ministry, very faithful to me and my three brothers, I had a wonderful church just like this church. I did not see hypocrisy there, or any such things. But despite those blessings and many other blessings in my life, I chose to live in rebellion against God and I am ashamed to tell you that even from the youngest of ages I turned my back on the things of God and I went my own way. And I went that direction for 27 years. And I just loved to party. I was very foolish. Er I got involved with alcohol and drugs and all the relationships that go along with that partying life style. And it was very unfortunate. Sin has its fun for a season. We know thats true in our lives, and the Bible tells us, There is fun in a season, but in the end it leads to death. There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end, it leads to death. (Proverbs 14:12) And I am afraid I had to learn that the hard way. But I went to the university, and I went downhill very fast at the university. I graduated and I began to work my way up the corporate ladder, but I found no fulfillment in these things. And I found myself, after 27 years of living this way, in a very dark place, full of shame and guilt and fear about the future, fear about eternity. But I will tell you this, in all those 27 years, my parents and many other people never gave up on me. They continued to live a life as an example to me. They prayed for me faithfully and they shared with me the good news. Because they knew the good news of Jesus Christ had power to transform my life. No matter how far away from the Lord I had gone and I was very far from Him. I had a mask for the world to see: everything is fine with Andrew. But in my heart, I was in a deep dark place. But they never gave up and they tried many things over the years. But eventually in 1993, Dad invited me to an event, where the good news was shared and he was the one sharing it. And I went to this place and it was my time. God had orchestrated my life and my circumstances very specifically for that moment that I would hear the good news. And it was a miracle. No one else could have orchestrated all of the things that would lead me to this place, but God was doing it and He was using so many different people sowing the seed, watering the seed all along the way. My parents prayed and then they shared with me the good news. And in this moment, in a big stadium, in Kingston, Jamaica, which is where the event was, I heard that message and I responded. All of the shame and the guilt of my life and the pain of it were before me. And I called out to God in that moment. I said, God, if this is true what I am hearing about Your Son Jesus that He came as a baby, innocent and humble, to bring transformation to the world; if He did that for the world but also for me, but then He lived this life with death and buried but rose from the dead with power, if He offers me that power and that salvation, Lord if this is true, I want to know. Reveal yourself to me. And I called out to God. Just like you might do even today in this beautiful celebration, you might say, Ive never known God like these people had known Him. And I want to know Him today. You can do the same thing I did on that day. I called out to God, I said, Reveal yourself to me. And He did just that. I called out to Him and said, What is keeping me from You? With great sincerity in my heart, I said, What is keeping me from You? And He opened my eyes in that moment to see what was keeping me from Him. And it was just all of the garbage of my life, all the sins of my life: my lying, my cheating, my stealing, the abusive relationships, my arrogance, my pride and so much more had blocked me from the relationship that I was created for. And I saw all that, He was gracious and He allowed me to see it. And I was broken and I was crying. I had never cried a day in my life that I remembered. And now I cried everyday when I think of the good things of God. And I saw it there and I said please forgive me, and can you guess what He did? Exactly what He promises. He says if you confess your sins, I am faithful and I am able to forgive your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. And that is exactly what He did in that moment. Change after Conversion:And it was a radical change in my life. And I begun to grow and understand the things of God more and more. And now I have an opportunity to share this message around the world and I am very privileged and I hope that little testimony will encourage you in two things. One, to be active in sharing your faith and never give up even on the most difficult people who really seem to resist the Lord. You never know what the Holy Spirit of God is doing in their lives. So never give up. Continue to pray and share the good news. And then some of you might be hearing and you say, I would love to pray and share the good news with my friends. But actually I am here and I am much more like where you were, and Ive been hearing God calling me, I think. I feel like God is doing something in my life and Ive been investigating that. I pray that today maybe you would allow this to be the day that God transforms your life and you will never forget it, because it is a day of celebration, it is a day of Christmas and it is a day of the great wedding of Jessica and Dong Li and it will be a great way to remember that this was the time that God transformed your life. And maybe I could just help you if you are willing when God has been calling you in this kind of way, orchestrating your life and your circumstances for this very moment. The Message:Maybe Ill just share with you in a few moments the good news that my father shared with me that transformed my life. Its quite simple really, simple for us, but not simple for Him, because He is the one that paid the penalty. But this is what it is. The good news is simply this. God says, and I pray youll receive it as from Him, directly into your life in this moment, not my words, but the living God speaking to your heart. And this is what He says, I love you. Isnt that good news? He sees your life from start to finish, and He still loves you. Its beautiful! He says, I love with an everlasting love. And in the book of Jeremiah, one of my favorite places where He describes this love. He says, Before I created you, in your mothers womb, I knew you. (Jeremiah 1:5)Isnt that beautiful? He created you, He knows you inside and out, and He loves you, and He created you for a purpose, which is to be in a relationship with Him. One of the pictures that He uses for that relationship between God and His churches is like husband and wife. We are made to be in a relationship with Him. And that relationship is broken, because of all of the garbage of our lives. I shared a little bit of my life with you but you have your own life. The Bible says this, All of us are like sheep have gone astray, each one to his own way. (Psalm 53:6) So I would just ask you, which way have you gone? Here is the good news, He says, all of us are like sheep have gone astray, each one to his own way, but God laid on Jesus the sins of us all. That is the good news, there is a penalty to be paid. We sense that in our spirit if we are honest, we know that there is something happening. But He says, I paid the penalty. And He says, If you confess your sins, I am faithful, I am able, I will cleanse your sins, forgive your sins, cleanse you for all unrighteousness. Invitation Call:If you are willing I could just leave you with a little prayer, and this could be your day. I know my message is short, but if the Lord has been preparing your life, you would have been ready. So I will be happy to lead you. Let us just bow our head and pray. And any body, we rejoice with you that you have come. God has led you to this place, so that you can receive all the good things of God, and soon you will have a full understanding of every good thing you have in Christ. John 1:12 says this, To all who receive Him, that is Jesus, to those who believe in His name, Jesus, He gave them the right to become children of God. That is just the beautiful picture of the relationship that you are made for, made whole again. You could just pray this prayer, not my words, but your heart connecting to the living God: Heavenly Father, I love you. Thank you for loving me and never giving up on me. I believe in you. I receive you. Come into my life. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Thank you for coming in. Thank you for heaven. Ill never fear death again and Ill never fear life again, because now I know that you are with me. Show me what to do and use me. I want to be active in sharing my new faith, so I can come to a full understanding of all the good things that I have in you. In Jesus name, Amen! Amen! Hallelujah! Well, its a beautiful day and we rejoice with you, if you pray that prayer, it would be wonderful if you would promise me to do one thing before you leave this place. Tell someone about the decision youve made, because we want to help you to grow and we want to encourage you. So you could either tell one of the pastors or one of the ministry leaders or the friend who brought you.   Just say, I have to do what I told Andrew what I would do. I promise him I would tell someone and I am telling you, will you help me?And they will help you, OK? We will rejoice together. And lets let the ceremony begin.

The younger one said to his father, Father, give me my share of the estate. So he divided his property between them. Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. When he came to his senses, he said, How many of my fathers hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants. So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. The son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. But the father said to his servants, Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Lets have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. So they began to celebrate.Todays sermon topic is Amazing Grace. Now lets welcome Larry. Sermon:Good morning. I am so happy to see you. I am so glad you are here. Today I am going to talk about Gods amazing grace. We are going to look at the parable of the lost son. In some translation its called the parable of the prodigal son. Right? This parable was told by Jesus. Jesus is giving us a picture of what our God the Father in heaven is like. I believe many of you have heard or read this parable before. I believe there are a lot of things we can learn from this parable. I hope todays message can give you a fresh look. For some of you, you are probably quite new to church. For some of you this may be your first time coming to church. My prayer is that, by the end of this service, you will experience Gods amazing grace and unending love. You will understand His forgiveness. Please join me in a short prayer. Heavenly Father, I want to thank you for this opportunity to speak about your glory, your love and your amazing grace. Lord, please help me to speak about this subject clearly. I ask you to open our eyes, help me to deliver your message. I want to lift up the rest of our time into your hands. I pray this in Jesus name. Amen!Lets get started. If you have a Bible with you, please turn to Luke 15. Let me read the first two verses. The Parable:Jesus continued: There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, Father, give me my share of the estate. So he divided his property between them. In this story, there is a father with two sons, one elder son and one younger son. The younger son came to the father and asked for his inheritance. The father divided that between both sons. I want to give you some background information to help you understand. You know, in Jewish culture, a father only gives his assets to his son when he is dead. However, the younger son went to his father and asked for the inheritance. Thats not common. Its like your child come to you and ask,I love your wealth more than I love you. I want my inheritance now. I wish you are dead so that I can get my inheritance.The Fathers First Shame:Can you image your child come to you and say that? That just breaks our heart. Dont you think so? Thats really disrespectful to the father. His father can reject it, refuse it. If the father accepts his request, at that time, in Jewish culture, all the wealth was held in land. There is no bank account. His father cannot write a cheque or give him a credit card. His father had to sell the land. Thats really a shameful thing. Think about what people in that community would say, What happened to his family? What happened to his son?You know what, the father accepted his request and allowed him to make his own choice and go on his way. The father knew that pushing his son or asking his son to stay would not help. That would only push his son further away. He couldnt get his sons heart.The Waste and Famine:(Lets) carry on the story. In verse 13: Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.Let me tell you a little bit more about the Jewish culture. Accepting inheritance means accepting responsibility to carry on providing for the family. The son is not looking for responsibility but money. He wanted to choose an easy road. The younger son got everything he could get and he left his father, his brother and the community. He went to a distant country. He could buy whatever he wanted to buy and live a life the way he wanted it to be. In the story, he wasted everything he had. After he spent everything, there was a bad famine in the country and he began to be in need. When I read here, I felt really sad, not because he spent all the money but because the choice he made. He just broke his fathers heart, left his father and made his own choice. Sometimes we are just like the younger son. We want to make our own choices. We dont want to listen, we want to control. We walk away from our Heavenly Father. We think thats the best choice.Verse 15 says this: So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.You know, in the Jewish culture (back to the culture again), they think pigs were unclean animal. Jewish people do not even want to touch pigs. For Jewish people, a person to feed the pig and eat the food pigs have just touched, thats just humiliating. No one gave him anything. Look at the story. All his friends left him. He spent all the money. He was hungry, homeless and had nowhere to go. Decision to Come Back:When he came to his senses, he said, How many of my fathers hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants. This younger son wanted to go back home. He knew that his fathers hired men, they had more than enough food. He was starving to death. He knew he needed to go back to his father. Some believers say, this son repented and came home. But think about it. Did he really care that he broke his fathers heart? Did he really care? Why did he want to become his fathers hired man? I believe he was not going home for his father. He was going home because of food. He also prepared a little speech, what he wanted to say to save some face and get some food for him. The Fathers Second Shame:Verse 20, So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. So the son went home and his father saw him while he was still a long way off. He ran to him. What does that tell you? From hundreds of meters away, his father saw him and ran to him. It tells this father is always waiting and watching for his son to come back.When I ask you how old do you think this father is? Some people may say (he is in his) forties, fifties or sixties, we dont know. But we know one thing in Jewish culture. For Jewish culture, if (we let) an old man run that is called humiliation. In the story it says, his father saw him and was filled with what? Compassion! Notice that his father was not filled with anger. You know the same way, no matter what you have done, you can be far away, but our Heavenly Father is waiting for you to come back. He is looking for you. His love is constant, patient and welcoming. He is searching for us, giving us opportunity to respond. He will not force us to come to Him and love Him. He loves us while we were still sinners and we rebelled against Him. Sometimes we come to God not directly for Him. We have a motivation; maybe the motivation is not pure. We want something to eat, or to be blessed financially, or to be healed. God understands our feelings. He welcomes us. No matter what we have done. He is waiting and watching for you to come home. Thats our Father. You know in the story, the father ran to his son, he is not like walking or jogging. You know in the Hebrew, I mean in Greek the ran is trekh-o, which means to run his son in a race, hundred meter race, to run really fast, to his son. He threw his arm around his sons neck and kissed him over, over, over again, mua, mua, mua! Do you have an earthly father like that? I believe even the best earthly father cannot do that. You know, have you thought of asking, why did the father run? What motivated him? You know he has to shame himself, and I told you that in Jewish culture, an old man is not supposed to run, thats considered shameful and humiliating, and you know in that time the Jewish people got the long robe when they ran he had lift up their robe and ran. This is another humiliation. Why his father ran, Have you ever thought about it? Why and what motivated him to shame himself? Fristly, I believe the father was really really happy. His heart was filled with joy: my son is back, my son is back! And I believe think about the son, what he feels that moment? You know, his son were likely to be filled with fear and shame when he came close to his home -- the people in that community or maybe hired man would disrespect him or look down on him, wanting to reject him. However the father had taken the full shame that should have fallen upon his son. He wanted to show their community that his son was welcomed back, so his son would not experience the same shame and humiliation of the rejection. What an amazing grace! Can you see that? You know the father ran to his son very fast, threw his arm and kissed him over and over again. This happened even before the son could tell his father, I have sinned against heaven, against you. Before that, did you know that you have a Heavenly Father like that, you have a Heavenly Father. He is waiting for you to come back. When the moment you want to return, he runs to you, wants to throw his arm around you and kiss you, not just to walk to you.The Fathers Love:Verse 21 to 24:The son said to his father, Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.But the father said to his servants, Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Lets have a feast and celebrate.For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. So they began to celebrate.This son has prepared a little speech when he came back and he had been practicing all the way: father, I have sinned against heaven, and against you, and no longer worthy to be called your son; and your lost son had absolutely dishonored his father. In Jewish law, a rebellious son can be stoned to death or his father can disown him. His father didnt say to his servants: Bring my sticks, I am getting a beat him, this is a rebellious son! He didnt say like some parents would to the children, you are so stupid, I told you why didnt you listen, you ruin everything. Instead, his father welcomed him, gave him ring, got him honor, some shoes, had a feast, and celebrated for him. What a great picture. This son did not ask for this thing, did he? The father just gave it to him, treated him like a hero. It is hard to understand. You may say: he doesnt deserve this, no, he doesnt deserve this. But you know what? That is called grace. Grace is something someone give you that you didnt earn it or deserved it. I need to elaborate this. I want to show someone grace today.Whats your name? Yuna. Yuna? OK. I have a gift for you, this is an mp3 with Bible audio on it. I hope you can listen to it all the time.You may say: why did you pick her? What did she do? I dont know. Maybe just she sat on the front row. This is going to happen, next week you will see that is a very hot seat, or nobody wants to sit there. You know thats the grace, someone give you something, you dont deserve it or you dont earn it. Thats called the grace.Performance  based Society and Religions:I feel living in this society many things are performance  based, performance - based love. Think about it, when we were young in school, during school, for students who could get good scores in exams, they were called what? Good students. The parents will love them, the teacher will love them, by the way, I was not one of them. You know if you obey your parents, they will be happy. We grew up, we go to a company to start to work. Our boss or manager loves the one who can bring the most profits to the company, and who can get job done well. They could love them and think of them highly. You know everything is so performance - based. After I became a Christian, I thought if I could do good things, I think God will think of me highly or love me more. If I have done something wrong, I am very ashamed to come to God, I am afraid to come to God. And I think God probably is not going to love me. But thats a lie, thats not true. Some of you, you have become Christians for many many years. Are you also in that category? Like the elder son, you still think Gods acceptance or His love is based on your performance? If we think in that way, you know, we will have little joy in our Christian life. Phillip Yancey, a Christian author, says, Grace means that there is nothing we can do to make God love us more. Grace means that there is nothing we can do to make God love us less. It is not dependant on our performance, but His own.Sometimes, people think God is like a policeman always looking for faults. If we have done something wrong, He is going to punish us. You see the story, our God is merciful. He is a loving Father. Amen. Our God is a loving Father, He is merciful.There is another group of people, they think by doing good works, they will go to heaven. If you ask someone, Do you think you will go to heaven? They might say, Why not? Because I am a good person. I am always doing good things. What is wrong with that for a good person doing good works? In a worldview, that seems to be someone noble. And they can tell God, God, look, the things I have done, I have done this, I have done that. I earned a way. I can go to heaven. Let me tell you this, that is not noble, that is arrogant! They want to put all the focus on them, they want to get the glory. Grace  giving Father:Do you know all the wisdom, resource, dream and strength, that is for God? And you want to get the glory; you think that is something you have done to earn it? If we think that we have to do good works, we can go to heaven, we have little joy, because we will think, Am I good enough? Am I good enough to go to heaven? Am I good enough?! The gospel tells us that we can go to heaven not because of us, but because of God, what God has done for us. God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die for us on a cross, paid our sin, we can trust Him, ask Him to be our Saviour, to save us to live for Him, and He will give us this for free. Salvation does not come by work, but by the grace of God! Let me repeat this, Salvation does not come by work, but by the grace of God! Can you read out loud with me?Salvation does not come by work, but by the grace of God!A famous pastor, Tim Keller, puts it this way,Religion says, I give God a record of righteousness, and God owes me a blessing. But the gospel says, God through Jesus Christ has given me a perfect record of righteousness, which I receive by faith, and now, I live for Him.The Bible tells us, All have sinned, all human being has sinned. We are all like the lost son, we all fall short the glory of God. And sin separates us from God. Understand Gods Grace More:Let me read the rest of the story, verse 25  32:Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. 'Your brother has come,' he replied, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.' The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!' 'My son,' the father said, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'Many people are familiar with what happened to the younger son, but there is also important truth we can learn from the elder son. The elder son is being self- righteous. It is clearly contrasted. The father is giving grace and mercy, but the elder son is so angry because he thought the more he served his father, the more he would earn his blessing. But we see what the father has is already his, he does not have to earn it. We live in this society, in which we think everything is performance  based, we have to earn it. You know, God rescues us, and with this gift, His own Son Jesus Christ, He showed us His amazing grace. Exaltation of Grace:We know that Christmas is coming, the whole world celebrates Christmas. Christmas is not just for having a good time, or having a discount that we can go shopping, or Christmas is not just for a holiday. The true meaning of Christmas is that we celebrate Jesus arrival, we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, we celebrate the eternal hope we can get. Jesus is the Saviour for all nations. Every single person in the world, Jesus paid it all (for their sin). You know that men do not seek God, God seeks men, and Gods grace found us. It is all about His grace. I believe that you are here not of accidence or coincidence, God is waiting for you to come back home. It is all about His grace. We can know Him not because we are so good, or better than some one, that is because of His grace! We can live, that is because of His grace. It is all about grace! Can you tell your neighbour, It is all about His GRACE!It is all about His grace! He loves you, He wants to give you grace by you believing in Jesus Christ, His Son, you can have eternal life and enter into heaven. Some one might say, Wait a minute, you mean, everything I have done in the past, everything, he is going to forgive it all? Erase it all? And I do not need to pay? I can go to heaven?Yes, by believing Him, trusting Him, asking Him to be your Saviour, to save you. By repenting, asking Him to be your Lord, you can go to heaven, you can have an eternal life. Salvation is a free gift, but it is not cheap, Jesus paid it all. By believing Him, asking Him to be your Saviour, you can have eternal life.Some of you know that my wife and I are expecting a baby. In 10 weeks time, we are going to see our baby. Holding my baby, I always think, it is so fast. But my wife always thinks, why is it so slow? We just love the baby, (who is) so precious. We speak to the baby, we pray for the baby, we read for the baby, we sing for the baby, (who is) so precious! I cannot imagine someone might hurt my baby. When I think of God sending His one and only Son Jesus Christ to die for sinners, people to be against Him, I just cannot understand. That does not make sense. That is beyond our law, imagination or logic. But God loves us, He loves us, no matter what you have done, Jesus paid it all. Call for Believing and Reflection:I want to ask you to close your eyes, to reflect on this parable, to think about Gods love. I cannot imagine, I send our baby away, not only sending away, He died for someone, someone who is against me. When I think about that, it just makes me cry. Think about how great that love is, God loves us more than we can think or know. We have a Father in heaven like that. Every time he surprises us with His grace, He truly is a loving and merciful Father beyond our imagination, beyond logic. He loves us because it is who God is, not because who we are. He wants to give us His grace, we have to accept it. For some people in this room, you may think, Nobody loves me! Nobody loves me in this world, how can I find love? You have to know that God loves you so much that He can accept you no matter what you have done, no matter what poor choices you have made. You can come to our heavenly Father empty - handed, you do not need to earn it. God loves you, and wants nothing more than you to come home. Jesus has paid it all. This morning, you can ask Jesus to be your Saviour, ask Him to give you grace, to be your Lord, your friend. For some of you, you have become a Christian for many years, you think God loves you because of your performance or your efforts or what you have done, you can come back to God, ask God, Thank you for your amazing grace, not based on my performance.If you accepted Jesus, you can pray with me,Jesus, I want to come home. Thank you for dying up on the cross and rising again to save me. I was lost and I want to be found. Forgive me now of all my sin. Come, be my Saviour, my Lord, my friend. Change my life, make it new, and help me, Lord, to live for you. Thank you Father. In Jesus name, Amen.Transcribed by Chuck, Esther and Franz, with grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ!Amazing Grace18th December 2011                                                                   Larry LiuHaidian Christian Church"

For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.""40:6 A voice says, ""Cry out."" And I said, ""What shall I cry?"" ""All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field.40:7 The grass withers and the flowers fall, because the breath of the LORD blows on them. Surely the people are grass.40:8 The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever.""40:9 You who bring good tidings to Zion, go up on a high mountain.

See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.40:11 He tends his flock like a shepherd: He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he gently leads those that have young.God, our ComfortA Happy New Year to you! Let us bow in a prayer:Heavenly Father, it is so good to be with our brothers and sisters in this place of your holy presence. Indeed here is your Godthe God of the universe, the Creator of all things visible and invisible. The One who heaven cannot contain, is here with us. We bow in your Majesty, in your Holy presence, we sing Holy Holy Holy! Lord God Almighty, you reign! You are sovereign, and you purchased us by the precious blood of your Son Jesus; we are yours and yours forever! Father, as we journey on this time together, please speak to us, we have come to hear your Word; speak to us O Father! For we are hungry, we are thirsty, we are dry we need forgiveness, and we need your salvation. Come, our saving God and speak to each and every heart here; fill this church with your glory; fill this city with your glory and fill this nation with your glory that this nation will glow with your glory to the farthest end of this earth! May your name be exalted; may your name be the sweetest name on every lip here, and in every heart. To you be all the glory because we pray this in Jesus name, AmenAt the beginning of a year, its always a good habit to ask God for a special word, a special verse, or a special promise that you are going to cling to for the rest of the year. Everyday every moment, this precious word that He has given to you, you are holding it close to you. And it will tie you through from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. Its our prayer, as a church, that you will receive a word from God, that you will take home and take to heart so that it will be life-transforming forevermore. What do you do when you are discouraged? What do you do when you prepare your thesis, you are about to present your work and your hard drive dies, all your files disappear and you have nothing to present? What do you do when your boss does not give you the raise or promotion that he promised? What do you do when you receive some bad news? A friend may be leaving; someone may have died; perhaps you yourself have received news from the doctor that your health is not good, or the university that you applied to will not accept you. You have worked so hard and there is discouragement. In todays story, we have a people who are very discouraged, we have a people who  were called by God as their very own; but they find themselves in captivity: far away from home, far away from their temple, far away from God, far away from any comfort. They wondered: Did God give up on us?! Did God forget us? Did I sin too much that He has said I will choose another people? Am I so abandoned? I am so lonely! They began to wonder and Gods Word to them is a Word of promise, and a Word of comfort, for them, for those who are going to exile and for us who are discouraged or anxious or worried or heavy laden. Our passage is taken from the book of Isaiah and the author is the prophet Isaiah. The name Isaiah means Yahweh is Salvation. And this is a very appropriate name because it is the theme for the entire book. In fact, we see Judas Salvation from her enemies; we see Judas Salvation from  exile in Babylon; we see the Jews Salvation when Jesus comes in His Kingdom to reign for a thousand years and then we see the sinners Salvation from evil to be saved to eternity. The book has some key words but these key words are actually the names of God because the book is about God. Isaiahs prophecy was about Yahweh, the covenant God who entered into a covenant relationship with sinful men by reconciling Himself to them. This is the most common name. It appears over six thousand times in the Old Testament and in this book, over four hundred times. The second name is Elohim, God says I am Lord and supreme over every idol, every imaginable idol that you can come up with. I am supreme over them. Adonai appears 52 times and He says I am Lord over creation. Creation seems so powerful: the mountains, the oceans, the tsunamis, the earthquakes But God says I am sovereign over creation. And then He says I am Yahweh Sabaoth Lord of wholes. I am Lord of the heavenly powers. Any imaginable power you can think of, in heaven or on earth, I am Lord over that. One of Isaiahs favorite names for God is Holy One of Israel. God is perfect; God is greater than everything visible and invisible, and God is near, He is lofty, high and holy, but He is near, He is with the lonely and broken-hearted, He is God EmmanuelGod with us. Imagine, He is the Holy One of Israel; He is the Holy One of Haidian Church; He is the Holy One of Beijing and He is the Holy One of China; He is the Holy One of you. He desires to enter a relationship with you and me. Yahweh423Covenant RelationshipElohim103Supreme over idolsAdonai52Lord over creationYahweh Sabaoth52Sovereign over heavenly powersHoly One of Israel25Perfection, Greatness, NearnessOur story takes place primarily in Isaiahs Ministry to Judia, the southern Kingdom. Isaiahs Ministry spanned for about sixty years from 739 to 681 B.C. in the Southern Kingdom made up of Judah and Benjamin. The Northern Kingdom had separated at that time with ten tribes; they later fell to Assyria in 722 B.C. and then Judah, the Southern Kingdom fell to Babylon in 586 B.C. If we are going to divide the book of Isaiah up in divisions, there are two: the first division is Chapters 1 to 39 and we call this Retribution or Judgment and the second division is Chapters 40 to 66 and we call this Restoration or Redemption. Theres judgment but there is Salvation! Judgment, because God is Holy and Salvation, because our God is a saving God.Our passage can be divided into three parts: Isaiah 40: 1-11, we call that Compassion; Verses 12-26, we call that Comparison, God cannot be compared to anyone, He is incomparable; Verses 27-31, He is our Comforter, He is the One who gives strength to the weary, give strength to the young and to the old, He gives strength-- unbelievable and unparalleled invisible strength! Our passage today Verses 1-11 will be divided into four small sections: verses 1-2, A voice of Pardon; verses 3-5, A voice of Preparation; verses 6-8, A voice of Promise; verses 9-11, A voice of Presence. Lets go into our first division: verse 1 says, Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. The people had been in exile and  they had been feeling this abandonment. They were no longer feeling close to God. Away from home and away from the temple. And God tells the prophet: Comfort my people. Yes, they have sinned, but they are still my people. Yes, they have committed a great crime against me, but they are still my people. And I, Im still their God. When they heard Isaiah say your God, what a joy must have filled them. To rely on God was still considering them His precious possession, His precious people. He says, not only do you tell them comfort once, but tell them comfort twice. Comfort, Comfort, Comfort, Comfort! Let the echo throughout the world that Im the God of comfort for all whore heavily laden, all who feel anxious, worried, discouraged, and distressed. Comfort, our God offers you comfort. The second verse tells us Speak tenderly to Jerusalem. Speak to them, not with the condemnation and judgment, but speak to them like a mother, with care and compassion of a mother. My people need to know that I love them tenderly regardless of what they have done. What is He to tell them? There are three very beautiful things He is to tell them. The verse goes on saying: proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received double from the hand of the Lord. Her God and our God tells us that there is a limit; this too will pass! This dark period, this discipline, this time of trouble, it is limited. God says, it has been completed; your time of exile, your time of being far away from me will be completed. There is the end. There is a light at the end. You will see this light. And the light is Jesus. He says, not only do I limit your difficulties and challenges, but I give you limitless forgiveness. He says: your sins have been paid for. You did not work for it; you did not pay for it. You couldnt have been slavery and exiled for 70 years, and it would not be enough. The only payment, sufficient and satisfactory is the blood of Jesus Christ. His blood and His sacrifice alone can satisfy the Holy and just mind of our God. And God said: youre worth it. I will deliver my only begotten son for you. You are value to me. I love you intensively. And I will pay for your sins. And that was Christ has  done. The third thing he tells us is that they have received double from the hand of the Lord. They did not receive double judgment because God does not deal with us according to our sins. Hes gracious, extravagantly gracious, excessively generous. He gives us double comfort. He gives us double mercy. He gives us double portions of love. God repays what youve done to Him with double comfort and double love. He does not deal with us according to our sins because He is a God of grace, and God of mercy and God of love. Surely, you must be attracted to this God of comfort because there is no one on earth like Him. So our principle is from the Bible and it says, Principle: Without the shedding of blood, theres no forgiveness. (Hebrews 9:22). Why? Because its a crime against God. Sin is a crime against God. Blood is to remind us of the magnitude of our depravity. Surely murdering the Son of God must be the worst crime in all of history. And yet it was on that cross that Jesus prayed: Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do. So wasnt it dark hour of history that the greatest of pouring of grace and forgiveness came? By the blood of Jesus, and by His prayer, and you are evidence that God has heard and answered Jesus prayer because you have come to know Him as your personal savior. When I think about life, we are very quick to escape from pain. But it is so sad that we are not equally quick to escape from what pains God. My brothers and sisters, we need forgiveness, and God is extending His arm and says I have what you need, the forgiveness that you need so that you can be with me forever. Application Questions: Will you ask for forgiveness?Will you forgive your enemies? Our question then for you is: Are you willing to forgive your enemies? Are you willing to forgive someone who has wronged you? Are you willing to forgive someone who hates you? Are you willing to forgive someone who continues to abuse you? Forgiveness is very difficult, isnt it? Its very difficult because it requires humility to say I am wrong and you are right to someone that we might think its not worthy. Dont you see that it is actually a problem of pride? We dont forgive, or dont want to forgive, or dont want to ask for forgiveness, because we are too proud. He should come first and ask me for forgiveness or I didnt do anything wrong. I am entitled to be treated better. We know that we have no rights. We have been called to be just like Jesus. How did they treat Jesus? They despised Him and rejected Him. They pushed Him away and said I dont have time for you, I dont value you. And so as we deny ourselves each day and pick up our cross, we are not offended when people slight us, get angry with us, when people do us wrong, we can learn something from it. If you have wronged someone, be quick, the Bible tells us do not let sun goes down on your anger. Be quick to see the reconciliation. Let there be no unforgiveness in your heart. Let us pray together our application prayer: I adore you Precious Lamb and seeker of the lost. I confess and Im sorry for rebelling against You. Thank you for saving me from sin, Satan and death. I pray You shape my heart to Your Desires. Our second division is preparation. And we are going to read the next verse, verse 3, and it says: A voice of one calling: in the desert, prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God. This is a prophecy that the gospel writers in the New Testament attribute to John the Baptist who came to prepare the way for the Lord Jesus Christ. And his message was ones repentance because the kingdom of God is at hand. The kingdom of God where Jesus reigns is coming. What we are here to ask to do, at Christmas especially, we are reminded that Jesus is coming. Jesus came as a baby and He is going to come back again to reign. But that requires preparation; that requires a revolutionary period of preparation for each of us. How revolutionary is it? The next verse, verse 4,  tells us how we should prepare, it says: Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low, the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain. This is the picture when the King is coming, the servants will go ahead and remove all the rocks; remove all the obstacles so that the king could come in gloriously and with dignity and majesty. Our King -- the greatest King of all the universe, He is coming. And Hes saying: prepare, get rid of everything that will obstruct me for coming into your heart. When you pray this verse, you can say to God there are no mountains or obstacles, there are no obstacles so deep, there are no problems so wide that are going to prevent me from loving you. You know that there are no mountains that God cant help deliver you from. You know that as you go up to the mountain, youre getting close to God. Moses went up on the mountain; Jesus went up on the mountain of transfiguration. Look, look, how He will reveal His glory through the mountains that you face in your life today.Our principle for this section from another Bible verse says: Principle : our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us  an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.(II Corinthians 4:17) God is saying to us that our troubles in this earth are light, not heavy, and they dont last very long compared to what He is reserving for you in heaven. So persevere, these troubles will refine you, these troubles will perfect you, these troubles will call you to depend on God more and more, and these troubles will allow you to see Gods glory. How can I see Gods glory in trouble? When you have trouble, then you can experience comfort. When you have difficulties, then you can expect a miracle. When you face impossibility, then you can expect Gods glory to be revealed. God desires to give you a vision of Himself this year, a vision of glory.Application Questions:Jesus desires to come into your life.Will you clear the stony soil from your heart for Him to reign?So lets ask ourselves then: Jesus desires to come in, will you clear the stony soil in your heart so that Jesus can come in and reign? Jesus wants to be your King; He is the only King that should reign in your heart. Are you going to prepare and remove every obstacle so that He can be absolute King in your life? The answer should be yes. Trust me, its the right answer. So please read this prayer together: I Adore You my Sovereign Lord and KingI Confess I have loved other gods above YouThank You for the Joy & Honor of serving YouI Pray for Power to obey Your Will faithfully So can we trust God? Yes. Because our third division tells us: Gods voice is a promise. In the verse 6 here: A voice says, Cry out. All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field. The grass withers and the flowers fall, because the breath of the Lord blows on them, shortly the people of grass, the grass withers and the flowers fall, but the Word of our God stands forever. You may have power right now, you may have prosperity right now, and you may have popularity right now. Everything may be going OK for you right now. But we know that its temporary, what is seen is temporary, what is unseen is eternal. And what is God saying is that all these earthly glory that you may be attracted to or distracted by, they are only temporary and will not satisfy you. They will not satisfy, they are a shadow pointing towards eternal realities: Myself Im your God, I alone can satisfy you because my Word will last forever. Even heaven, even earth will shake, but my Word will remain standing forever. And thats Gods promise for us. When you are distressed, discouraged, then go to Gods Word for there is no other treasure, there is no other anchor that you can find that will guarantee to secure your soul when the most difficult wind of opposition attacks you.So a principle which is also from the Bible and not surprising is: Principle : Without faith, its impossible to please God (Hebrew 11:6). You can only please God if you have faith. Faith:Faith knows God is PresentFaith trusts Gods loving purpose in every testFaith seeks how to glorify God through testsFaith submits to God without questionFaith lives for Gods Approval, not His deliveranceI want to tell you a few things about faith very quickly. We believe in something that is invisible, cant be seen. We also believe in something that is inevitable, because it is guaranteed by God. We also believe in something that is in the future. We dont have it yet, but it will come and its invisible and eternal. A few more thoughts about faith, when you are going through a difficult time: Faith knows God is present. Faith is absolutely certain God is here. The second thing faith knows and trusts is that God has a loving purpose in this test. God will not allow anything evil to happen to you, He has a loving, absolute perfect purpose prepared for you. The other thing that faith does is that it looks for ways to glorify God through the tests. Not pity: oh Im so hurt; oh I am so beaten; oh I dont know how to get through. Faith says how can God be glorified through it all. How can it exalt the name of Jesus through it all. Faith also submits to God without question. Faith says: I dont understand everything, I dont have all the answers, I have many questions, how, when, where, or why, I dont have the answers, but I know Him and I know that He can be trusted. So faith just says: I will be, I will be. I can ask questions, but I cant question His authority. Finally faith doesnt seek just deliverance or answers to prayer; faith seeks to live for Gods approval. I want to live to please God and I know you want to live to please God too. Application Questions:Does this describe your faith?Will you exercise faith in your current circumstances?So do you have this type of faith? And will you exercise faith in your current circumstances? Its hard, isnt? But thats why we have one another, thats why we have the Word of God, thats why we have the Holy Spirit living within each of us. We arent left alone, God the Almighty is with us. You are not alone; there is nothing too great or too difficult for our God to handle. If God is for us, who can be against us, so be on Gods side. So lets pray our application prayer together: I Adore You as my Promise Keeping GodI Confess I have trusted man instead of YouThank You for preparing a future full of hopeI Pray for Help to live with an eternal perspectiveFinally, I am just going to read the last verse. There are two pictures of God. One, a Almighty powerful God who has got the authority to rule, the authority to reward and the authority to judge. He says I am powerful, yes but I am also very personal. Im your personal shepherd. And this is what it says in Verse 11: He tends his flock like a shepherd. He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart. He gently leads those that have young. He is a tender shepherd.Principle: If God be for us, No one and nothing can prevail against us.Application QuestionsWhat need in your life would you like your Shepherd to meet today?So what needs do you have in your life that you would like our great tender almighty powerful shepherd meet today? If you are: Hungry  Let Jesus feed you!Lonely  Let Jesus hold you close in His arms!Tired  Let Jesus carry you near to His heart!Lost, looking for direction Let Jesus our great shepherd of the sheep lead you!Isaiah 40:1-11 Summary1-2 A Voice of Pardon Sacrificial Lamb3-5 A Voice of Preparation Coming King6-8 A Voice of Promise Trustworthy Friend9-11 A Voice of Presence Gentle Shepherd I want to end with Isaiah 40:26: Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing. This is a verse that is very close to our hearts. And it is a verse that ties us through moments that are very dark. Its a verse that comes from one of my dear friends, she was far away from home, she had no job, she had no money, she had no friend, she was in a foreign country, she didnt speak the language, and she knew no one. She was helpless, hopeless, on the street, no food and nothing. And it so happened that she had some money in her pocket; it was 40 dollar and 26 cents. So she looked up this verse in Isaiah, and this is the Word that she got from God. She looked up and she saw the starry host and she said: Yes, Im poor, Im hopeless, Im helpless, Im friendless, I have no finances, I have nothing but I have a Father. He is the One who is holding up each star, He is the One who knows the stars by name. He is the One who loves them because He sustains them with His almighty power. He is the one who knows me and will sustain me.Isaiah 41:10 Gods New Year Promise Presence, Possession, Power, PermanenceSo do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God.I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right handI pray that as we go into this year 2012 that you will know Jesus Christ as your comfort, that you will fix your eyes upon Jesus, the author and perfector of our faith. He will be your everlasting joy and everlasting comfort. May God bless us in all circumstances. To God be all the glory for He is worthy.   May God bless you richly in 2012 as you install Jesus as your Eternal Comfort! PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 5"
"21","20120108eng","2012-01-08","Pastor Wu","The Return to Nazareth ","Matthew 2:13-23","The Return to NazarethDate08.01.2012PreacherPastor WuScripture ReadingMatthew 2:13-23Sermon topic/title The Return to NazarethMC Worship LeaderThree Significant Places in Jesus YouthGood morning and Happy New Year to everyone. Today is the second Sunday of 2012. Today is also the second Sunday after the Christmas of 2011. Lets continue to focus next 20 minutes on the birth of the Jesus Christ. Id like to focus next 20-30 minutes on the second chapter of Mathew, in which the birth of Jesus Christ is recorded. The reason why today I want to share with you the second chapter of Mathew is that in this chapter, not only the birth of Jesus Christ is recorded, but also in this chapter, three significant places are referred to. The first one is Bethlehem, in verse 6, Mathew 2:6 ""But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.The second one is in verse 13,Mathew 2:13 When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. Get up, he said, take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. (Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.)Egypt is the second significant place that is referred to in this chapter. The third place is in verse 23; Mathew 2:23 and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: He will be called a Nazarene.1. Contrast of peace and violence - BethlehemAs all of you have already known, Jesus was born in a small town  Bethlehem, and Bethlehem is in fact not a city, it is just a small town. And compared to towns in China, it can only be considered as a small village. Bethlehem is just a small village, six miles away to west of Jerusalem. And Bethlehem was a small village of peace and tranquility, where people lived a very simple and plain life, where people were so easily physically satisfied. They do not need to eat lamb everyday. They do not drink qualify wine for every meal. They are so easily physically satisfied. In this town, Jesus was born. Why was Jesus born in this small town of tranquility, of peace, of quietness and simplicity? Because the birth of Jesus in this small town signifies our simplicity. And let us know the message from God, that glory to God in the Highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favour rests (Luke 2:14). The reason why Jesus was born in this small town is that God wants us to know that He wants to bring peace to everyone. He wants to pass on a message to people of this world: Jesus is a King of peace, Jesus is a King of joy, Jesus is a King that people can come to Him and in Him, people can find joy and peace. That is one of the reasons why Jesus was born in this small quiet town. Brothers and sisters, I have to tell you, the Bible also tells us, Mathew 2:16 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.Brothers and sisters, you see, all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under were all massacred, were all killed. Brothers and sisters, you see, King Herod of that world, of that period, turned this quiet small town / village into a killing field, a place of violence and murder. All the little young children were killed. Brothers and sisters, let me ask you a question, when you are seeking the strength in Jesus Christ, when you are seeking baptism to become a Christian, to join Christian family, what is your hope? Your hope is only to join a family of happiness, of joy, of peace, of fun, of friendship, of fellowship? If that is all you have expected from being baptised into a Christian family, let me tell you, you are probably wrong.Are we living in the world, as we become a Christian or after we became a Christian, are we living in the world of joy? Yes we are. We are always enjoying because of Jesus. We are always enjoying because our Lord triumphs over the world on behalf of us. Yes, we do have joy. But almost everyday, every single day, every single moment in our life on this world we have to face problems; we have to face difficulties; we have to face oppressions; we have to face suppressions; we have to face even, to some degree, persecutions. A few young people were planning to gather together in a small restaurant a few days before Christmas. But police came to them, preventing them from having this Christian fellowship in celebration of Christmas. And they were warned, If you do that, something will happen to you.The King Herod turned that quiet, small, blessed place into a killing field. When we are baptized into Christ Jesus, and the people and the king of this world, king of this authority and the authority of this world wants to turn that place where we enjoy intimate relationship with Jesus Christ  into a killing field, a field of murder, a field of violence, a field of persecution, a field of oppression. But brothers and sisters, before I go on I want to share a testimony with you. From Acts chapter 16, (Acts16:16) where the Bible tells us that one day Paul and Silas were on their way to a place of prayer, and they were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She was a fortune-teller. And because she had this kind of ability of fortune-telling, she made a lot of money for her owner and she followed Paul and Silas and Paul commanded the spirit out of her. So she lost that capability of doing fortune-telling, so the owner of her was so mad. The owner of this young little girl brought Paul and Silas to the Bible tells us, see they were seized, Paul and Silas were seized and dragged into the market place to face the authority. Paul and Silas were brought before the magistrates. And also in verse 22, the crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas. How many people, how many Christians today were, are and will be attacked?  and magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten. And how many Christians and very often, and how often we Christians in this world will face being stripped and beaten. Acts 16:23 After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. And how often, Christian brothers and sisters were, are and will be flogged and be thrown into prison and carefully guarded. Are you expecting after being baptized into Christian family, (there is) only joy, happiness, wealth, everything will be fine, everything will be OK. You are wrong. You will be facing a killing field. 2. Comfort of a hiding place - EgyptBut brothers and sisters, do not be in despair. Do not be desperate. Do not be in despair because our Lord loves us. God loves us that He not only already prepared the salvation long time ago, but also He always, He always prepares a way out for His followers, for His children, for us, for our Christians. In Matthew 2:13, the Bible tells us When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. ""Get up,"" he said, ""take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt.  So you see Egypt was a hiding place, was a hiding place for little baby Jesus, for Joseph and little baby Jesus mother Mary. And our Lord also has a hiding place for us. He always has a way out for us. In Psalms 59, the author calls out to God, But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble. (Psalms 59:16) Brothers and sisters, in Psalms 91:2, the Bible also tells us, ""He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust."" In Jesus Christ, we can find refuge. In our prayer, we can find the strength from the Lord Jesus Christ. In our fellowship of 2 or 3, we can find help from our Heavenly Father. So brothers and sisters, if you are facing unbearable situation, come back into Jesus, come back into Jesus through prayer, through fellowship of 2 or 3 people, through Christian brothers and sisters fellowship where you can find the strength and people will walk along side you and God will walk along side you. Not only so but also He will prepare a banquet in the presence of our enemy to humiliate our enemy.So Egypt was a hiding place for Jesus, for Jesus family. And we also have a hiding place. Do you very often come back to the church to worship him? Do you often a few times a day pray to God? Do you regularly join a Christian fellowship, a Bible study? If you join a fellowship of 2 to 3 people, the Lord will be with you, because in Him we can find asylum, a hiding place. 3. Come back for faith and growth - NazarethThe Bible also tells us in Matthew 2:23,and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: He will be called a Nazarene.Nazareth is referred to in this chapter. Nazareth was a place where Jesus was brought up. Nazareth was a place where Jesus was physically nurtured and spiritually nourished. He grew up there. And He took the root of His faith in that place. He grew up in physical body and also in faith in that place. So brothers and sisters, I want to ask you again, where is your Nazareth? When will you be back to your Nazareth? Where is your Nazareth where you can take the root of your faith, upward to the glory of the Lord, downward in the rock of Jesus Christ? Where is your Nazareth? Let me tell you. Do you very often come back to the church to worship the Lord? Do you often or regularly join Christian fellowship to nourish your soul, to share your witnesses with other people, to grow with others, upward to the glory of the Lord, and downward in the rock of Jesus Christ? Do you do that? Do pray very often so that your prayer can come to the presence of the Lord and your faith will be nourished and your soul will be nurtured? Brothers and sisters, as we have our faith growing deeper and deeper in the Lord, we will understand the world we are living in, (even though in this church we became Christians, or wherever it was, wherever you were baptized,) may not be something you expected. It may not be a place of joyfulness. It may not be a place of quiet, tranquility, peace, health or wealth. It may not be something like that, but something of persecution and oppression. Your faith needs to grow stronger to face this so that you can grow closer to the Lord. On the other hand, believe and trust that our Lord always have a way out for you that you can have a hiding place. Meanwhile, you can always come back to Nazareth where Jesus grew up, where you can also grow up alongside Jesus. If you can do that, you will flourish. You will yield a lot of fruits. In Jesus name, Amen!MCs introduction to the Holy Communion:Because today is the second Sunday of this month, we are going to have Holy Communion. Our volunteers, please be ready to help. As for us, please prepare our hearts, give thanks to God and pray to Him. Pastor Wu:For many people, New Years Day is the time to make New Years resolution. But for us Christians, New Years Day is always the time for us to come to the presence of the Lord, not only in celebration of Jesus Christ, but also to commemorate His death and His salvation. All rise please! Let us pray before the Lord. Heavenly Father, we thank you! We thank you for this fellowship. We thank you for the salvation that you prepared for us. You have your only begotten son crucified on the cross so that each one of us can have hope for eternal life. Dear Heavenly Father, today, your children of this church come to your presence so that they can not only be cleansed, but also grow stronger into the rock of Jesus Christ. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for the blood and body of Jesus Christ that you set before us. We just pray that through the blood and the body of Jesus Christ the intimate relationship of Christian brothers and sisters of this church can be re-established. We pray all of this in Jesus name. Amen!In 1 Corinthians chapter 11, the Bible tells us through the disciples of Jesus, For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me. In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me. Amen!

Even if I share my darkness or weakness with her, she always understands why I have that kind of thoughts. I dont know whether you ever have this kind of friend; when you share your darkness or your weakness, you are not afraid but you feel you will be totally accepted. Like this friend of mine, she understands why I have this kind of thoughts which are not very good, and she can accept all my weakness. However, if this weakness is found in others, she may not like it. But because she loves me so she accepts me as who I am. I remember once she told me she didnt like sensitive people but later I found sometimes I was sensitive about something. One day when we were together I said to her: I remember you told me you dont like sensitive people but later I found I am also sensitive sometimes, why do you still treat me like your friend? She told me then: Even though I dont like sensitive personality, I like you so I accept you as who you are. So whenever I want to share something with her, I am never afraid that she will leave me or judge me; I never worry about the fact that she knows my weakness, because I know she really loves me and she accepts me as who I am. Once I was so upset and I called her to share my sadness, one of her sentences touched me so deeply that I would never forget it. She said: you know Gloria you are treasure in my eyes! At that moment I was shocked because in my life I had never thought I could be treasure in someones eyes. I dont think I am worthy being treated as treasure in someones eyes. But in my friends eyes and in her heart she regards me a treasure for her I am so special and precious to her. So dear brothers and sisters I am so grateful that God gave me such a wonderful friend! This also reminds me of what Gods love is like. Todays Scripture is from Luke 7:36-50, it talks about how Jesus was anointed by a sinful woman and the main point of this story tells us what Gods love is like and whom He loves. First we know the story starts when Jesus was invited to have dinner in a Pharisees house and in the meantime the woman heard this news and then she came too. But we should know who woman is in this story. From the Scripture we know as the Bible tells us that she is a sinful woman. This woman who lived a sinful life came to the house. What kind of sin did she have? What kind of sinful life? The Scripture does not tell us in details but we can imagine: Maybe she was greedy; maybe she was proud; maybe she was together with many men; maybe she told lies often; maybe she liked to judge others. Perhaps it is easy for us to imagine her sin is the same as what you and me have struggled with. We know she lived a sinful life though the Bible does not tell s in details so here she was called a sinful woman, she was highlighted as sinful! But she received the good news: Jesus was coming to the Pharisees house! So she came too and why did she come? She was a sinful woman and she was divided from the Pharisees! How can such a woman come to a Pharisees house? She should be separated from them. But even though she was a sinful woman, she knew Jesus was the savior so she wanted to come to ask for Jesus forgiveness and give Jesus the best gift she could give and hoped Jesus would forgive all of her sins. But when the woman did all these how did the Pharisees respond? From this chapter we know that the Pharisee respected Jesus so he invited Jesus to his house and have dinner with him. We know from the Gospel that many Pharisees didnt like Jesus and they thought Jesus not God. They were jealous but this certain Pharisee he invited Jesus to come to his own house and have dinner with him! So we can see he respected Jesus and loved Jesus. However he didnt like the womans action and in his mind this woman was a sinner. Jesus if you are the prophet you should not allow this sinful woman to come near you, you should reject her! and also this showed that the Pharisee did not understand who Jesus was. Dear brothers and sisters when we regard this woman as a sinner, do you also think that the Pharisees a sinner too? This Pharisee didnt regard himself as a sinner; he felt that he was self-righteous: I am a good person and I am doing good deeds; I am not called as a sinner, I am righteous. He was self-righteous and he liked to judge others. He didnt have any mercy on others and he just liked the people who were like him, the people who seemed righteous and good from outside. So dear brothers and sisters, shall we think about ourselves? Most of us somehow are like the Pharisees, we feel we are better than others when comparing with them and we are self-righteous. We think we are good people, we are better than others and we judge others as sinners. For somehow it confuses us when God does something like He did in this story. Sometimes we question God Dear Lord why did you save this person? My God why did you forgive that person? That person was so evil please do not forgive him for he does not deserve your salvation, you should abandon him, and you should let him go to hell Sometimes we are like the Pharisee; we judge others but we forget we are sinners as well. We forget maybe what is inside of us is worst than that is inside of them. We cannot read others minds we cannot see others hearts or thoughts, we can only see their behaviors. Sometimes we judge people through their behaviors but this is not correct all the time, maybe some people their behavior are very good but inside of them, they are actually very ugly, which is what we cannot see.So we all judge others like the Pharisees and the other guests in this story, we dont really understand who God is, what Gods love is like and whom God loves? So when Jesus responded to the Pharisee, first He told the Pharisee a story: Two men owed money to a certain moneylender, one owed him five hundred denarii and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he cancelled the debts of both. Then Jesus asked the Pharisee: which one of them will love him more? And the Pharisee answered: I suppose the one that has the bigger debt cancelled! So Jesus wanted to tell the Pharisee with this story that He would forgive the woman, and to point out that the Pharisees and the woman were both sinners. Maybe you consider yourself as the man who only owed 50 denarii to moneylender but, you still owe money. Even though it is not much, you still own someone else. Even though the woman seemed to owe 500 denarii, Jesus still forgave her; He would like to cancel all of her debts.From Jesus reaction in this story we know, Jesus told the Pharisee later (From Verse 44): Do you see this woman, I came into your house, you didnt give me any water for my feet but she wipe my feet with her tears and wipe them with her hair; You didnt give me a kiss but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet; You didnt put oil on my hand but she has put perfume on my feet, therefore I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven.As a result, we can know that this sinful woman would love Jesus more than the Pharisees for she was forgiven of many sins!!So from this story we can know what Gods love is like and who He loves. First what is Gods love like? No matter how many sins you have done; no matter how bad you are, God always loves you completely and unconditionally. Brothers and sisters no matter how many sins you have done, no matter how bad you were in the past, God loves you completely and unconditionally, just look at the woman in this story, the woman was highlighted as sinful but, Jesus still accepted her and loved her and forgave her. So brothers and sisters God today tell us: no matter how many sins you have done and no matter how bad you were and what was your past like, even if you feel you have been abandoned by the whole world, God still loves you and God still accept you as long as you come to Him and ask for His mercy, He will forgive you.; He will show His mercy and grace to you immediately; He will forgive you instead of punishing or rejecting you. Second, who does He love? He loves all sinners, no matter how sinful you are, Jesus Christ our Savior came to this world to just look for this kind of person. He died on the cross for all sinners so Jesus said in Matthew9:12-13 It is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick; but go and learn what this means, I desire mercy, not sacrifice for I have come not to call the righteous but sinners. He Jesus Christ, the One our Heavenly Father loves the most, but our God allowed Jesus to die on the cross, why? Because He love us and that is why. Dear brothers and sisters, can you imagine this? Maybe I shall put it in this way so that you can understand it more clearly. I think some of you here have your own kids; some of you here will have your babies in near future, imagine let your own beloved child die on a cross and you can see all the suffering he is experiencing, can you imagine how much your pain will be and can you count how much your heart will hurt? Maybe most of us here we dont have kids yet but all of us here we have someone we love very much, your mother, your father or your husband, your wife, your boyfriend or girlfriend can you imagine if they were nailed on a cross? If it was possible, we would, of course, do our best to prevent this from happening. But our God loves us so much that He allowed His only beloved Son to be nailed on the cross though He know how much pain that would be! Why? To save you and me! So dear brothers and sisters, how does Jesus love us? In John59: Father has loved me so have I loved you. I want to challenge you have you ever thought about how much a father loves his son? This kind of love is perfect love; this love never changes; this love is unconditional; this love lasts forever! And her Jesus tells us the He loves us in the same way as a father loves a son. Who are we? We are sinners. Who are we? We were against God from beginning. Who are we? We commit to sin always. Are we worthy of being treated this way? Do we deserve being treated so preciously? No, absolutely not. But Jesus our Savior He healed us and He gave us the promise and He loves us the same way as Father loves Him. Can you really understand how much Jesus loves us? Are you 100% sure that Jesus Christ our Savior who died for you and me on the cross is so crazy about us? Can you imagine this? This reminds me of a sisters testimony. She shared this when she was getting baptized and she told us how bad she was in the past and how she thought no one loved her in the world. She felt that no one cared about her so she wanted to kill herself. In fact she had tried many ways to kill herself but she failed every time. One day she went to a church and she heard the speaker said: Even if you feel no one loves you in this world, even if you feel you are so bad and sinful, God loves you and His love never changes. At that moment she was shocked: it was as if Gods speaking to her: My beloved daughter, I love you and I care about you! I care you more than you can imagine; no matter who you are or what you have done in the past, I just love you as you are. So she was saved by our Lord. When I recall my own salvation, Id say its Amazing Grace! No matter how dark my heart is, I always come to God without any fear, for I know He will forgive me no matter how deep my sin is. I remember once I committed the same sin again and I was so disappointed so I prayed: Dear Lord, I am so ugly and I feel so guilty; I committed the same sin again even though I wanted to trust you, even though I wanted to avoid many sins in my mind, I failed so many times. I feel so sinful and I dont think I am worthy to be saved; do you still love me and forgive me? Will you still save me to eternal life? I cannot imagine you could! To my surprise, while I was praying like this I heard a voice saying: I tell you the truth, today you will be with Me in the Paradise. (Luke23:43) Even though I commit the same sin again; even though I think I am not deserved to be saved by my Lord, instead of condemning me, God told me that I will be in the Paradise with Him! Gods words comforted me immediately. So dear brothers and sisters, it can be call Amazing Grace! My chains are gone and I have been ransomed by my Savior by my Lord! When we look at our Savior Jesus Christ, we can see He cares sinful people. Like the woman in Luke7, like the sister I just mentioned, like you like me However many people even many believers, somehow are willing to love a good person who at least is defined as a good person in their eyes, we like to get along with someone we love, someone who is successful, someone who is easygoing, someone who is beautiful or someone who has an abundant spiritual life Of course it is not wrong to love them and they should be loved, but in the meantime, do we also love those who are not that cute? Those who have a lot of sins? Those who are even defined as evil? Those who have very bad behaviors? But this is what Jesus is always doing! If we call ourselves as His disciples, we shall follow His behaviors! Or we are just kind of following Him? What if we become the ones who love people around us? This is what it really means to be Jesus disciples. What if we become loving persons to the people around us? As it says in Romans5:6-8 You see, at just right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.But God demonstrates His own love for us in this. While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. When we were still sinners our Lord died for us; before we were created, our Lord died for us! After we get salvation from Him, sometimes we commit many sins but God still loves us and forgives us. God treats sinners like this and if all of us here have experienced His mercy and grace, how should we react? Do we really understand Gods love? Dear brothers and sisters, are you really sure that Jesus loves you and cares you more than you can imagine? If we really understand Gods love, our life will be changed for the love will change our thoughts and actions. Lets think about the following questions as application to this sermon: How do we treat other sinners inside and outside of the church? Do we accept our brothers and sisters who commit sins? Do we accept outsiders who come to Jesus? What do we care most about in our lives? Do we focus on loving others or about holding wonderful meetings, making perfect plans, holding successful activities or having many good ministries? Do we want just to love our parents, wife, husband, friends those who love us? Do we care more about doing the right thing in our eyes than loving others? Whats your No.1 priority? The most important thing is that Jesus is love. It is not about doing right thing in our own eyes, the No.1 thing is love. Love is more important than making sure everything is going smoothly; love is more important than doing good deeds or arguing about what is right or who is good. But for many times we have argued about who is good who is bad, what is right and what is wrong instead of loving others. I hope all of us here we can think about how much God loves you? Today is the last day of 2011 and I dont really know you all here but, God knows. At this moment perhaps many people are going back to their hometown and you cannot go back, I understand your loneliness, some of you are struggled and some of you feel no one care about you in this world, no one love you but at this moment our God wants to tell you: My dear and beloved child, I care about you, I love you! My love for you is so crazy! I am crazy about you and I care for you more than you can imagine! Hope you will think about Gods crazy love and respond such crazy love to our Lord and others in 2012 to make your life different and live in Gods love day after day in this new year. Lets pray:Dear God thank you so much for giving us your unending love, Lord you are so precious and your love to us never changes. Lord please help us to respond to your such crazy love and to love our brothers and sisters at church, to love our family members at home, to love our co-workers at work. Please help us to deliver your unconditional love to all the people around; please change our lives so that we can become loving to the people around us. Lord hope you will change us through our behaviors and our minds that we can spread out your love, we can love all the sinners!! May your Word comfort our hearts, if some of us here are sad or hurt by others, hope you tell us that you love us, you care about us and you are crazy about us! Hope your Word will encourage us in the new year and you will give us more abundant life in the new year that we can walk in your Word, we can walk in your Faith, we can walk in your love. We pray in Jesus name!"

I did some research and it said there was a snake called the belchers sea snake. And it is so poisonous that its venom, its known, estimated to be able to kill a thousand people. That is impressive. But someone told me, no, its a land snake. In India, there is a cobra and that has much more poison. I dont know whether its the land snake or whether it is the sea snake (that is more poisonous). But I know one snake, a spiritual snake, that is very deadly. And all of us, because we have been bitten by Satan, we have been bitten by the ancient serpent, we know he is the deadliest of all snakesthe spiritual snake. Todays story is about snakes. The author of the book called Numbers, his name is Moses. Moses wrote the five books, the first five books of the Bible. And he is the author of this book Numbers. The name Numbers comes from the Greek and Latin translation of the Old Testament. The reason for this is because there is a census in the first four chapters and there is a census in the Chapter 26. So this is very appropriate. The Hebrews, they call this book In the Wilderness, which I also think is very appropriate, because it describes the wilderness wonderings of the people of God. And all of us can relate to wilderness experiences. Moses is known as a great leader of Israel, a great leader, a great liberator, a great law-giver. He was Gods man to bring His people out of Egypt, out of slavery into freedom. Gods mana great man. How do you know he is great? The Scripture tells us a lot of things about Moses. One, he gave up everything. He gave up living in the Palace of the Pharaoh. He gave up the chance of becoming a prince of Egypt. He gave up everything to be Gods man, to be associated with Gods people, and to face suffering and persecution, to lead the people out of slavery into the glorious freedom. Another thing that tells us that he is great: twice God told Moses, These people are making me very weary. Their rebellion is making me very angry. I would like to wipe them out and start afresh. I will make a new nation out of you Moses, a great nation. What do you think? Moses replied, Lord, forgive these people, forgive them their sin. Do not do this. Instead, block me out of your book and let them live. Let them live. This is a man of the Gods heart, willing to give up everything, even life, so that the people of God and the reputation of God will be honored and glorified. He is a great man, not because of his position, but because God is in his life. Our book, the book of Numbers, can be divided into three sections. The first 10 chapters will be divided and called Directions for the Desert. 11-25, Discontent and Death in the Desert. And the last section, Departure from the Desert, their preparations to depart from the desert. Chapter 21 can be also divided, but this time into 4 divisions. The first 1-3. Destruction, the destruction of King Arad. We have Death in our next section. And verses 10-20, Desert wondering continues. And then 21-35 Defeat of other enemies. Our section verses 4-9 will be divided into three. Verses 4  5, we call it Discontent. Verses 6-7, we call it Discipline and verses 8-9 we call it Deliverance. Discontent, Discipline and Deliverance in the Desert. First Section: DiscontentOur verse 4 reads, They traveled from Mount Hor to the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom. And they grew impatient on the way. We may jump and say, Those people are so ungrateful. God just delivered them from a mighty nation called Egypt. God just freed them and did a wonderful miracle. Why is it that they become so impatient? We have to understand we are in the last leg of their journey. It has been approximately 40 years. Thats a life time for some of you. 40 years of being in a desert, in the wilderness. No comfort, just the shifting sun, the burning heat and no decent food, very uncomfortable. Everything is very temporary, lonely. These people have just won a victory against King Arad. And they were just a short distance away from the Promised land, when Edom, their own brothers, denied them entry through the land. Why cant we go straight in? Why do we have to delay? A journey that should or could have taken 11 days has prolonged because of disobedience and disbelieve into a 40 - year testing, 40 - year trial. And these people were tired. This last delay, the last detour discouraged them greatly. And they went on and said in verse 5, they spoke against God and against Moses, and they said, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die, to die in the desert? There is no bread! There is nothing to drink, and this food that we have been eating, manna, for 40 years. I'm tired of it. I want steak, I want lobster, I want a banquet, I want a shelter, I want some comfort. I believe that we can all empathize with these people about being in the wilderness situation. A wilderness where things are going our way, things are not happening fast enough. I am not getting the right answer to my prayers. Things just are too dark, too difficult to see the end. I'm dry nothing gives me joy; I'm thirsty, nothing satisfies me; I'm hungry, nothing seems to be substantial, purposeful. Where are you? Oh, God! Where are you? I'm in such a wilderness. They are very much like us when we say to God, I will be happy if I will be happy when you change my circumstances; I will be happy when you make me rich; I will be happy when you make me successful; I will be happy when you give me bread; I will be happy when things start to working faster and better. That's when we become discontent, when our plans and the future that we envisaged for ourselves do not happen. These people are just like usdiscontent. Principle and Question for the First SectionThe principle that I have for you today for this section is when all you have left is Jesus, you will discover that Jesus is all you ever need. Honestly, my friends, you may seek all earthly treasures, all earthly prestige, you may seek social position, and you may seek prosperity. But as a song said, all is stripped away, and everything will be stripped away ultimately. What are we going to have? What is left? What remains? Jesus! Jesus tells us that heaven and earth will pass away. Unbelievable, isn't it? This earth and heaven, can it really pass away? It is so solid. But you know that God cannot lie. It's impossible for God to lie. And so He says that when everything is gone, all you have is me. And you know what Ive discovered is that when all I have is Jesus, and then I actually have more than Ive ever wanted. When I have Jesus, I have discovered that I have moreinfinitely morethan I ever desire or want. So my question for you is, Are you in a wilderness today? And how are you going to handle discouragement?Id like to quote Lamentations chapter 3 as a very quick reminder of how I would handle discouragement. Lamentations 3:22 says: Because of the LORDs great love, we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. If you memorize this verse, and you tell yourself everyday, at the beginning of your day, God, your love is so great, so infinite, so unconditional. God you are so compassionate, no one understands me like you do, no one cares for me like you do. God you are so unfailing, you never forget, you never forsake, you are so unfailing, you are so faithful. God, everyday you have something brand new for me, for you, you are indeed that faithful God, who is my God.I have been also learning another principle. And Id like to share that with you. Its our Application Prayer. We read this together, I adore you, bread of life, my sole satisfier. I confess and I am sorry for being a complainer. Thank you for everlasting, indwelling life. I pray for willingness to change to your plans. Second Section: DisciplineOur second division is Discipline. I think you will agree with me that when we hear the word discipline, it is a very negative word. When I was growing up in the good old days at my school, my teacher had a very long stick, a very thick, long stick. And this stick was reserved for the disobedient. And Im sad to say Ive experienced the stick, the terror of the stick. I remember one day, my teacher grabbed by my pants and he pulled me in. And I saw the eyes of this man, the raging anger in this man. And then I saw him pulled down this huge, long, wide, thick stick that was destined for me. And I trembled like the mightiest earthquake. I screamed and shouted so loud that it gave my teacher a headache. So it reduced the ferocity and severity of my beating, Thank goodness! But you know, Ive learned a lesson. I would not from that day on disobey my teacher. It was painful, but it was corrective. My teacher got what he desired to achieve in me: complete obedience. I was a model student. I sat at my desk whenever I saw him, because that stick reminded me of my place. He was the boss, and I was the student. So whats going to happen with our discontent, complaining people? Well, verse 6 tells us, God sends a discipline. It said, He sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.God is not seeking to destroy us through discipline, but he is seeking to correct us, he is seeking to help us have a correct view of who He is, who we are, and what is the right relationship we must have with him.This is a good picture of salvation, isnt it? We are all bitten by the serpent Satan. Sin is that ugly poison that has infected all of us, and all of us are destined to die, some earlier, some later. What is the right response to this? Well, in verse 7, we see The people came to Moses and said, We have sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Pray the LORD will take the snakes away from us. So Moses prayed for the people. They begged Moses: Please change our situation! You must give them credit that they were sorry, very sorry, just like I was very sorry. You must also acknowledge that they admitted that their sin was against God and against others. So you must give them that for credit. And yes, their prayer was to change their circumstances. But God knows what they mean, and He would change their hearts. In fact, he would change not only their hearts, but he would change our hearts. All of us who confess that we have hurt Jesus and want Jesus to be our savior, and want Jesus to be our Lord, He understands, He knows your heart, and He will answer that prayer. Principle and Question for the Second SectionOur principle in this section here is that life is like a university. So in Gods university of life, discipline can either be your mentor or tormentor. Discipline can either be your teacher or your trainer, or it could be your tormentor or your torturer. As a child of God, you should be learning, you should think, God, what is it that you have to teach me in my current circumstances? Teach me quickly, teach me clearly, and give me the power to understand and do what you want me to do, so that I could please you.My question for you, from 2 Timothy 3:16, What is God seeking to teach you? What truth is He trying to teach you? Why is God rebuking you? What is wrong in your life that He is saying, That is wrong? What is God correcting? What is God saying that there is something that you are doing that is wrong and this is what is right? And then what is God training you for in your life? We know that His purpose is loving and His purpose is eternal, to make us grow in holiness. Holy oneness with Himself; holy, pure, blameless, spotless; a bride adorned for Him. We will pray our application prayer: I adore you my All-gracious, All-wise FatherI Confess I have loved my will above Your WillThank You for Your loving, purposeful disciplineI pray for humility to learn from all You aloneI pray for all of us that we will become students in Gods university.I pray that all of us will learn and graduate with great honors in Gods sight. Third Section: DeliveranceOur last division is called Deliverance and it starts in verse 8 and it is Gods solution; The Lord said to Moses, Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live. Look and live. God says that we all have a problem. We all have a broken relationship with Him. But God says there is only one solution. God says you need to look at this bronze snake, and you need to believe that my promise that you will live, and you need to trust that I can do what I say I will do. And that is what God tells us, Jesus is the solution to that poison of sin that is so deadly to our lives. If we want to live, we must look at the Savior. Our principle for this section is verse in Acts 4:12. And lets read it together, Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.And this name is the lovely name of Jesus. Jesus says, I am the way, the truth and the life. He didnt say that there are many ways; he didnt say that many different things you can do. He says I AM the way. If you want to know God, the Father, youve got to know Jesus, and no one else. If you want to be saved, youve got to trust and believe in Jesus. There is no other way. Principle and Question for the Third SectionYou and I have committed a crime against God, and God has the right to set the solution. His chosen solution is that we look to Jesus Christ. My question to you is, How will you respond today to Christ becoming sin for you?Lets pray our application prayer together,I Adore you my Rock, Redeemer & RefugeI Confess I have believed in myself, not YouThank You for saving me from eternal deathI pray for love for the lost & courage to witnessConclusion: Jesus Image in this PassageWhen we take a look at this passage, remember we have three divisions: Discontent, Discipline and Deliverance. Can we see Jesus in these divisions? Yes, in the first division, we see that they said I am tired of this food, referring to the manna. Jesus says I am the bread of life. Whoever partakes of me, or eats my flesh and drinks my blood will not die but have eternal life. In the second division of Discipline, the people pray and ask Moses, Please, pray for us. Jesus is our Mediator. He stands at the right hand side of the Majesty and Gods right-hand side. And He is intercedes, He says: Father, our daughters are in trouble. Father, your child is in trouble. Help them. Father, send your power, send your angels, send your Holy Spirit. Send your inspirations. Send your wisdom. Send your strength. Send your peace. He is interceding when you are so discouraged; when you are so tired, when you are so beaten down and you cannot pray for yourself, just know that God, the Son is your mediator. Praying ceaselessly, He who watches over you neither sleeps nor slumbers. He does not need sleep, He knows the number of hairs on your head and he is praying ceaselessly for you. Finally, in the last division, where is Jesus? He is our Deliverer. Believe it or not, He is the salvation snake, the Messiah, the one whom the Bible described as the servant of God, the Lamb of God, the pure, holy Lamb of God, who would die in your spot, in my place, so that we would not have to die. He tasted the full cup of Gods wrath, so that we would not have to taste it ourselves. He died at the most terrible and horrifying death so that you can have heaven, so that you and I could live with Him forever. So where are you looking? I would like to end with this,If you look inward, you will be depressedIf you look backward, you will be defeatedIf you look wayward around you, you will be distractedIf you look upward, you will be delivered. Are you suffering? Are you sorrowing? Are you going through a wilderness time in your life? And you think no one will understand; no one knows how much pain I am going through. No one knows the loneliness, is it a wilderness of death, a wilderness of disability, a wilderness of depression, a wilderness of darkness? A wilderness of debtis it so painful for you?God has a word for you today. He says, Look up. Look up to Jesus Christ. My God, my God, I give to you my life, I give to you my all. Something very small. When I had been going through a bit of difficult time, I said: Lord, today I am trembling so much before you. Please be with me in some tangible manner because I am so scared. I just dont know. You know the Lord is so humorous. He provided me with one of the tallest brothers I ever could meet. You may see him after the service today. Of course I looked up, so instead of looking at my dirty shoes and trembling, so scared and worried, I had to look up to my tall brother. The brother accompanied me to the church up the stairs and down the stairs to the sanctuary. His smile, his gentleness, and his love and faith in Jesus Christ, was a great comfort to me.Then God kept me looking up. I pray that the God will help you to look up this week and see the beauty, the majesty, and the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ who would come again to take you home, to be with Him forever and ever. Jesus Christ, sits on the throne, He is our salvation. God bless you. 05/02/2012        The Salvation Snake           Stephen WongPAGE  PAGE  7Haidian Christian Church                                                        "
"25","20120212eng","2012-02-12","Jessica","To Honor Him","John 12:1-8","To honor HimWorship Teams Prayer:Yes Lord Jesus, it is our desire to honour you. Thank you for adopting us as your children. Thank you for being with us each day. Lord, may your name be glorified today. In Jesus name, amen.Scripture Reading: John 12:1-8Good morning, my dear brothers and sisters. I am really happy to see you all here and worship our God together. Now lets bow down and pray together. Dear Lord, thank you so much for your love, for your calling. Thats why we can come here and to worship you and to get to know you. Lord, we know that we are not worthy for your death for us. Because we are sinners, we always sin against you. But God we know that you are merciful God. You are God of love. Lord, thank you so much for loving us, for saving us and for living in our lives. Lord Jesus Christ, today we ask the Holy Spirit to come upon us and reveal to us, let us know that Jesus Christ, you are worthy of all honor. I pray that God, please teach myself and please teach all my brothers and sisters here and let us know how great our God is, how deep you love us and let us know how we can honor you in our daily life. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Dear brothers and sisters, I am so happy that today I can share with you from John12:1-11. As we know that Valentines Day is coming soon. So many people may think about getting or giving or receiving gifts. So I dont know what kind of gift you want to buy for your wife or husband, for your boyfriend or girlfriend. I dont know what kind of gift you may receive from them. But it reminds me of a short love story written by O. Henry. It is called The Gift of Maggie. It talks about there is a poor couple. They love each other so much, but they are so poor. They do not have money to buy each other gift. Before Christmas they try their best. They want to honor each other so they buy one great precious gift to each other. We know that from this story, the wife has long beautiful hair and husband has a precious watch. So that is why the wife sold her hair and bought a chain for her husband and the husband sold his watch and bought a comb for his wife. I was so touched by this love story. But maybe some people will have thought they are so foolish because they sold the greatest treasures of themselves and bought the gift, which was useless. Some people will have thought that it is worthy to honor each other. Some people will say that it is not worthy. Introduction to the HistoryToday I am going to share with you to honor Him. Here Him means Jesus Christ. So through the story, John12:1-11, in this story there is a lady. Her name is Mary and she used one of the most precious perfume to anoint Jesus feet. From this story we could find that some people criticized her but Jesus praised her. Some people may have thought from the earthly (point) that it is not worthy but Jesus said she did a great thing. Today I want to ask you and myself to think about if it is worthy or not to honor Him. So I am going to preach in two parts. The first part is He is Worthy of All Honor. The second part is How to Honor Him in Our Daily Life.When we read Gospel John and we will find that in John 11, Jesus has raised Lazarus from death. Many people saw what Jesus did and put their faith in Him but some people did not. They tried to find a chance to kill Him. One day there is dinner for Jesus in His honor and on this day, Jesus visited the family of Martha, Lazarus and Mary. And from this scripture we will know that when Jesus visited them and Martha served Jesus by preparing a dinner and Lazarus sitting there and to honor Jesus by giving Him a witness because he was just raised from the death. And Mary poured a precious perfume on His feet to worship Him and honor Him. This is a very beautiful picture of all these three of Jesus friends, expressing their love for Jesus in different ways. Martha through the work in serving the dinner. Lazarus through his witness, who was raised from death by Jesus; and Mary through her worship by the fragrant offering. So I am going to focus on Mary because she was criticized. Through this scripture we found that one of the disciples said that, Why wasnt this perfume sold and money given to the poor? 1. He is Worthy of All HonourBut I will say that Mary did a great and right thing. First of all, because right after she poured the perfume on the feet of Jesus, the house was filled with the fragrance. She was a blessing to the people sitting in the house. Second, she treasured her opportunity to honor Jesus. From the Bible we know that when someone criticized Mary, Jesus said that, You will always have the poor with you but you will not always have me.Right after Jesus was crucified and the disciples realized that Jesus said that because He was going to die on the cross and this is a great opportunity to honor Him. That is why Mary treasured every opportunity to honor Him. Third, there is another deep meaning. From the Bible, it is revealed to us that Jesus was going to die for us. Matthew told us that, When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. (Matthew 26:12) She honored Jesus and Jesus honored Mary back. So from Jesus explanation, we will know that Mary takes every opportunity to honor Him. Mary, even she didnt know that Jesus was going to die, but she really took every opportunity to honor Him. That is why Jesus honored her back.In the Bible, Jesus said that, I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her. So this is what Jesus did to honor her back. But we know that in the same room and in the same group, there is another different voice from that. And they thought, it didnt worth to pour this precious perfume on Jesus feet. So Mary was criticized and misunderstood, but this is really a good lesson to me and to all of us. Let us think of that, is He worthy of it or not, is Jesus worthy or not. I think he is worthy of all honor, because Jesus is worthy, because of the gospel that He came to die for us, because He is almighty everlasting God, He is living God, He is creator, He is our savior, He is our counselor, He is our healer, He is our best friend and He is our all in all. Thats why he is worthy all of the honor, not only because he is almighty God, not only because he can do the great things, but also because the almighty God love the world, so He came to this world and became a person like you and me, and He died on the cross. The purpose is just to save all of us; the purpose is just to clean our sin, and the purpose is just to save us from the lost way, the purpose is just to open our eyes to see what the meaning of our life is, the purpose is just let us know that God is Jesus Christ, let us know what the meaning is that we are living on this world. So dear brothers and sisters, I just want you to know that from Psalm 116:8, it told us that, for you Lord, have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumblings, John Chapter 3:16 told us that, for God so loved the world, that He gave His one and only son that whoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life. And also Psalm 81 told us that, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above heavens. From all these Scriptures, we know that God is almighty God, and His glory is above all heavens. But He really wants to sacrifice Himself for all of us, and He wants to save us and He wants to let us have eternal life. So dear brothers and sisters, thats why I want to say that Jesus is worthy of all honor. But it also makes me to think of another question that why there is different voice and why the other people didnt think in this way. When I read this part of the Scripture, I found that one of these disciple had a very great excuse that, why not sell the perfume and have the money given to the poor?. And this is his excuse. But when we read later and we will find that John gave us the best explanation. He said that these people did not care for the poor, but he really cared about money. Because he was a keeper of the moneybag, the one who betrayed Jesus on the cross, and he betrayed Jesus by 30 slivers at that time. So dear brothers and sisters, from this Scripture, and we will know why people have different voice, why people dont think in this way, why people dont think Jesus is worthy of the honour of the pouring of perfume. Because they dont think about Jesus, they dont think about the poor, they only think about themselves, their money and their desire, their earthly desire. So dear brothers and sisters, from this Scripture, it told us that the people dont think Jesus is worthy of all honor, instead, they will think, should I give Him (something) or not. When they think in this way, it means it does not matter what kind of excuse you have, but our desire is on money. Recently, I read an article about stewardship. The first topic talked about where is your treasure, there is your heart. So dear brothers and sisters, from this Scripture, Mary, Martha and Lazarus loved and honored Jesus in their own way, and they gave Jesus the best in what they had. All of the three of Jesus friends expressed their love for Jesus in different way, Martha by serving, Lazarus by witnessing, and Mary by worship with the fragrance. 2. How to Honour Jesus in Our Daily Life?I want to ask myself and challenge myself, ask you and challenge you, how can you honor Jesus in your daily life? There are three things that I am reminded of from the Scripture. The first thing is to serve Jesus humbly. From Martha and we know that she prepared dinner for Jesus and served Him humbly. And Mary poured the fragrance onto Jesus feet and wiped His feet with her hair and she served Jesus humbly. The second one is that treasure every chance to honor Him. And the third one is to give Him the best. Interlude of a Personal StoryI remember that last year, one day I got a cell phone call from one of the sisters, and she told me that, she got to know a person, who was 19 years old, and he had leukaemia. He is not a Christian. But he thought he was going to die, and he really wanted to ask one of the pastors to visit him, and to get to know Jesus. Because he thought that if he got to know Jesus, he could get healed. We went to visit him and prayed for him and we shared the gospel with him. And in the end, he said that, I really want to accept Jesus as my own savior. I really thank our God even he was going to die, but he really wanted to accept Jesus as his own savior. Later on, his sister said that, If he is healed by Jesus, we can give all we have even if we want to let him to devote the rest of his life to Jesus Christ. After I heard what she said, it is very natural that people will not think about God until they are going to die. People will not give all they have and devote themselves to Jesus until they are going to die. But today, I want to encourage you and myself, do not wait until (it is) too late. Mark 12:30 tells us,Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.From now on, love your God the Lord with all your heart, all your mind, all your soul and all your strength, and God will give it back to you. And serve Him humbly. Treasure every chance, give Him the best. But some people do not think in this way. They think they can donate to Jesus Christ, to the church; lets honour Jesus, but lets not get silly about it. Lets anoint Jesus but not with expensive stuff; lets serve Jesus but lets not be crazy about it. This is what people might be thinking about. Yes, I can give some to Jesus Christ; I can give when I have extra; I can serve Him when I have enough time; I can serve Him when I have enough ability. But dear brothers and sisters, we know that Jesus Christ saved us and He gave us eternal life and He is our friend. He is not a sinner, but He died on the cross for our own sins. And what we have is from God. God gives us what we have, to be good stewards to what He has given us. So, we give Him back because we are grateful with what He has done for us. But not because some people would think that, if I give Jesus one hundred RMB, and then Jesus will have to heal my disease, my illness, and Jesus will give me a great family, good things as well. Instance of Hudson Taylors StoryDear brothers and sisters, there is a great example and many people know his name  his name is Hudson Taylor. Several years ago, I went to one of the churches in Zhejiang, it is called Gospel Church. Maybe we can see the picture (on the screen). And this is one picture I took from that church. What is written on that is what Hudson Taylor said. He said that,If I had a thousand pounds, China should have it; if I had a thousand lives, China should have them. No! Not China, but Christ. Can we do too much for Him? Can we do enough for such a precious Saviour?This is what Hudson Taylor said. He is one of the people to share the gospel to China. And he is one of the people to give their lives in China. And he is one of the people to donate all they have to Chinese church, and Gospel Church is one of the churches he built. But he said that, no, not China, but Jesus Christ. Why did he say that? He said, can we do too much for Him? Can we do enough for such a precious Saviour? Because he knows Jesus more, he owes Jesus this much, that is why he said, can we do too much for Him? Can we do enough for such a precious Saviour?Dear brothers and sisters, when Mary anointed Jesus with such precious perfume, which has cost her one year salary. And now, how much do you have for a years salary? When I read this part of the Bible, it made me very sad; I felt very sorry because I never gave one years salary once to Jesus Christ; because I did not give Him the best. But today, from this Scripture, I want to share with you and also myself  He is worthy of all honour. I want to ask you and myself, from now on, we can think about how we can honour Him in our daily life; how we can serve Him humbly; how we can treasure every chance to honour Him; how we can give the best to Him.Questions for Reflection and ApplicationDear brothers and sisters, here are some questions for you. I got to know that the average salary is about 65683 in Beijing last year. If you have a years salary or time to use for Christ, how would you use it? How is that reflected in your budget and priorities now? These are the things I want to ask you about, and they are the things I am thinking about recently.Dear brothers and sisters, this is the end of my sermon, and I ask you to think about these questions. And from next Sunday, we are going to start a sermon series, the purpose is that all of us could live out a Christian life in our daily life. So we hope we can pray for that. From next Sunday, we are going to start a new sermon series, which is called At Work. It is talking about how we can glorify and honour God at work. And then, we are going to go through Ephesians, from your daily life, different areas, how can we honour Him in our life. May God bless all of us, Amen.Holy CommunionGloria: We are going to have the Holy Communion together. It will be lead by Pastor Jessica. We know that Holy Communion is prepared for all the believers, so when we think about ourselves, what Jesus has done for us on the cross, prepare our heart, confess our sins and take the bread and cup together. So if you receive the bread and the cup first, please wait for every one to be served, and we will take the bread and cup together. Welcome Jessica.Jessica: Dear brothers and sisters, we are going to take the Holy Communion. We do this in remembrance of the love of Jesus Christ for us, His dying for us on the cross for our sins. Before we take the Holy Communion, let all of us pray together, and think about confess our sin and give thanks to Him. So lets all stand. I will give you one minute to pray for yourselves, and then I will end with a prayer.Our dear Heavenly Father, we thank you, thank you so much for sending your One and Only Son Jesus Christ to us. Lord Jesus Christ, now, all my brothers and sisters and myself come in front of you, we want to open our heart, and we want to tell you, Jesus Christ, that we are so sorry for the things we have done, which sin against you, against our family, against our friends, and against our neighbours. Lord, we are so thankful that because even we are sinners, we are not going to die, because you say if we confess our own sins and you are faithful, you will clean our sin and you will forgive us. Lord Jesus Christ, thank you so much for your precious blood, and cleaning our sin, washed away, making us so pure. God, thank you for the Holy Communion, for the blood and body, please let us be unified in you through the blood and body. Please let us live out our Christian life in our daily life through our Jesus Christ. We pray in Jesus name, Amen.1 Corinthians 11:23-3623For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,24and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.25In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.26For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.Brothers and sisters, you may be seated. When our brothers and sisters (volunteers) come to you, if you are a Christian, you can have the bread and the cup. In the end, we will have the Holy Communion altogether. Lets all rise. Let us take the Holy Communion together with a thankful heart. Let us pray:Dear Lord, our Jesus Christ, thank you so much for your love for us, thank you so much for your body and your blood, (with) which you clean our sin; through you, we have been accepted. Lord, thank you so much for the fellowship, which you give us here. Please let us love and build each other up in Jesus Christ. Lord, thank you so much for the daily bread, which you give us. Thank you so much for the money you give us, with which we can honour you, and donate, and give it to others. Lord Jesus, thank you so much for the hope you give us when we are hopeless, and thank you so much for the eternal hope you give us. Lord, we are looking forward to you coming again. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.Carol: Yes, our Lord Jesus Christ deserves everything. So we want to encourage you to give our life, soul and heart to Him, to live our daily for Him, to surrender our daily life to Him. I Give You My Heart.Welcome song.Lords prayer.Transcribed and edited by Christine, Hui Ren, Franz and Katherine with the grace, love and patience from our Lord Jesus Christ.To Honour HimJessica Wang                                                                   12 February 2012PAGE  PAGE  1Haidian Christian Church"
"26","20120219eng","2012-02-19","Gloria","Why Do We Work?","Gensis1:26-28,31; 2:15","Why do we work?Presider Cathy:Merciful God, we come together again to your temple to be embraced by your love and mercy. Lord, we are going to start a series of studies and reflections on your teaching on work, so that we may bear good witnesses for your glory in our daily work. We pray that you will send us your Spirit and fill our hearts with your Spirit. With your Spirit in us, please also help us see ourselves as you see us; help us see our neighbors as you see them; help us see our friends as you see them; help us see our enemies who are also created in your image. Lord, facing this world of wars, battles, murders, killers and disasters, we pray that you will help us understand that your will is to heal and bless, and that nothing stands in your way of receiving your gift of holiness and healing. Remove the expectations and pride in us so that we may come to you and open ourselves to all the possibilities you have dreamed for us. Lord, we also pray for each of us here, for the worship service, for the choir, and for anyone who come today to you for any mysterious reasons. We pray that we do not boast all more gladly of our own selves and of our own strength, but we will gladly boast our weakness so that the power of Christ may dwell in us. Teach us be confident, even in our weakness, in our sorrow, in our shortcomings, and in our imperfectness. Knowing that even in the middle of all these, you are with us, and your power remains with us. We pray in Christs name. Amen. Good morning,  Romans 8:28-39  We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who had been called according to His purpose. If God is for us, who can be against us. Christ Jesus who died, who is raised to life at the right hand of God, is also interceding for us. That means Jesus is praying for you. Jesus is praying for Daniel. Jesus is praying for me. Wow, Jesus is praying for us. He is interceding. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sward? No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors. Conqueror is a winner. We are winners. In all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him who loves us. For I am convinced neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord. You know sometimes, when the battle is long and hard, we can feel like giving up. And this week I have been so encouraged by the passage in Romans 8. We are more than conquerors; we are winners through Christ Jesus, our Lord. So we are going to try to teach you a new song that is based on this passage, Romans 8. So for a few seconds, I am going to become a singing teacher. Just to teach you the first verse. It does have a lot of words, but the words are from the Bible. And they are good and they will help us when we face our battles the week. Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord, as we pray, and as we read His Word, and as we pray His Word back to him: God, your Word says my God shall satisfy all my needs through Christ Jesus. As we pray the Word back, we become more than conquerors. So strength will arise as we wait upon the Lord,Father, God, we thank you for sending Jesus. We thank you that we are more than conquerors; we are winners through Christ Jesus, our Lord. We praise you Lord, you are so worthy to be praised. Thank you for everything you are doing for us, will do for us, have done for us. Through Jesus, Amen. Serving for today, we are going to have a series of reflections and studies mainly on the theme of work, and Christians and citizens of this world. And we are going to do it in pairs, so we have one speaker reflecting on the Scriptures and then we will have another one bearing good witnesses and telling us how, what and why they do it. Sermon:Why do we work?   GloriaGood morning, everyone. Could you please join me in a short prayer.Dear heavenly Father, thank you so much for inviting us to be a part of todays service. Lord, thank you for making us your children. Thank you for sending us your Word deliverers. Lord, I want to lift up todays preacher into your hands. Hope you will strengthen me, and you will deliver your truly Word for each of us here. And may your Word be glorified, and may your name be glorified. You know some of us here.We may have some sorrows. We may have some chains, but hope you may comfort us through your words, release us, and give us a light to know how we should act in the daily life. And hope your Holy Spirit can come to this service right now. Hope your Holy Spirit can lead us into your Word, and can lead us only to glory yourself. Hope you will be our center in our service. Hope your name be exalted by our worship. We pray in your name. Amen. First, I want to ask you to think about a question for a moment: Why do you work? Hope you will think about this, why do you work? I think some of you here have already started work in different jobs. So why do you work? There are many people in this world working very hard, but for the wrong reasons. I have listed four reasons why most people work so hard in this world. Number one is money. Many people work very hard for they want to make a lot of money, to be rich or to live a better life. They think if they have enough money, they can do everything they want, they can buy everything they need, and they can go everywhere they want. Money means power for them. They feel their life will be more comfortable if they have more money. Do you think you work because you want to make a lot of money, and you want to make your life more comfortable? Number two is identity. Many people work very hard to get a better job, to get a better position in a company. In their perspective, some jobs are more important than others. For example, if you are a senior manager, you will feel you are more important than someone who is a cleaner. You will think if your job is important, then you are important. You feel your job represents your identity. Reason number three is respect. If you have a successful job, where success is defined by worldly standard, you will be respected by many people, and also you will respect yourself. Like if you are the manager of iPhone (Apple, Inc.). We know many people are very proud of using iPhone 4s. Can you imagine if you are the manager of iPhone, you have a high position in making iPhone, you will be very proud of your job. But if you are sweeping streets or cleaning buildings, maybe you will be ashamed to tell others what kind of job you have. You may think others will look down on you if you tell them your job.  Reason number 4 is power. You think if you are in the high position, you will possess more power, you will control many things and many people, and you can control your personal situation as well. You can order someone to go there, go here, and do this, do that. When you do this, when you control some peoples life, you will feel very self-comforted. Dear brothers and sisters, if we have those reasons to work hard in this world, work itself is just a means to an end. So basically, for those reasons, we just work for ourselves or for our own benefits. Our will of work is very different from what we see in creation. So lets see what Gods will of work, whats the true meaning of work according to the Bible, why do we work?Reason number one is He works. From reading Scripture Genesis 1:26-28, we know, God had already been working before we started to work. In Genesis 1, God created all the things in this universe. He created all the things in 6 days. Everyday, at the end of the day, what did God say? Did God say, oh, I am glad its over. Its quitting time, yeah!  I cant wait for Friday. Did God say this? No. What did God say after the work at the end of the day? He looked at His work and said: Its good. Why? Because of money, respect, identity, comfort, power, control, nicer clothes, bigger house, bigger cars? No. Because He felt that work itself was a good thing, work itself was deeply satisfying. So on the sixth day, when everything was complete, God looked at the work which He had made and said, Its very good. Its very very good. Deep satisfaction from work itself. So in Gods will, work itself is a good thing, work itself is good in Gods eyes. As we just read, we are created in Gods image. So we know we are Gods image bearers. So He works and we work. Because He works, we should work. God made us for work. We work because we are created in Gods image and through work, we can reflect God and His character. The Bible teaches us that God has always been at work, and when Jesus came to the world, Jesus said to the heavenly Father, My Father is always at His work to this very day, and I too am working.(John 5:17) And the Bible also teaches us that the Holy Spirit is at work within us to do His will, to do Gods will. So this is why we work, because God works, we work. Reason number two is He calls. You know, dear brothers and sisters, work is also a calling from God. God calls us to work. Work is a special gift from our God and it is our privilege to be a part of Gods work. Can you imagine your identity in Gods eyes? This is the calling from God. God said it very directly, Let them rule  over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the living creatures that move along the ground. (Genesis 1:27)The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.( Genesis 2: 15)Look at here in our reading Scripture, who took the man to the Garden of Eden? God! Who gave this man the responsibility to take care of it? Who took the man into the work place? God! So you know why I want you to answer this question. We should remember who took us into the work place? Its our God. Our God is our real boss at work. So we turn to the reason number three  He is honored. I am working for His glory. I can find joy through work. As I just said, our God is our real boss at work. So we should understand and remember this point. Our God is in control in every situation; our God is sovereign over all things. We were designed to work, so we can take pleasure from work. We are Gods children, we are Gods stewards. Work is our Gods original plan for all the human beings. So we are Gods stewards. Our God is our real boss. We are not others stewards; we are Gods stewards. God is our boss, so we should work for God. Colossian 3: 23-24 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. Work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord, because our God is our boss at work. How can we work for Him? The only answer is to give all the glory and honor to God through work. Our God works as we just see in the creation and He enjoys work. We can find joy in work when we do it for our God. God does not need us to work for Him. We should know this. God likes nothing. He has everything. He calls us to work not because He needs our work. He does not need our work to satisfy Himself. He invites us to join Him with work for our sake. He invites us to join Him with work because we need to work, because it is He who gives us an opportunity to be a part of reflecting His character and ,Himself in our work. It is not because He needs us, but because God wants us to be a part of His work. This is an opportunity for you and me. So we should enjoy work and we love work. We do this for Gods glory and we can find joy from our work. But some people may think: I do not like my job, how can I enjoy it? My job is not suitable for me, how can I glorify God through my work? My job is so simple and so boring, how can I find joy from my work? And also these people may say, if I have the job I really love, if I have a job that suits my talents and my gifts very much, if I have a job that is very interesting, I will try my best to work hard. I will try my best to bring God glory. I will work with all of my heart. I will work for God. I will work with all of my passion. But dear brothers and sisters, let us think about where did Apostle Paul work when he wrote the Book of Philippians? In his office? No! Where was he? In the jail. When he wrote the book of Philippians, he was in jail! How did he feel when he we in jail? Angry? Sad? Fearful? Hopeless? Or Joyful? The Bible told us he was full of joy and also he could encourage others. He could encourage the believers in Philippians Rejoices in the Lord always! I will say it again, rejoice! (Philippians 4:4) Why? Because Paul knew he worked for God. No matter what circumstance he was in, he was able to glorify Gods name. He was able to find joy in his work. Do you think Paul liked the jail? I do not think so. Absolutely not. He did not like being jailed. Why could Paul find joy in his work even when the circumstances were so bad? Because he did not think about himself. In his eyes, he himself was not important. To Paul, God had the ultimate importance. He only cared about God in his life. He only lived for God in his life. Dear brothers and sisters, do you think your work place is worse than jail? Even in jail, Paul could spread gospel to others. How about us? If we can have a heart to serve God, no matter what kind of job we have, we will bring God glory. We can honor God regardless of our situation.So I want to have a quiz. Let us go over the three reasons why the Bible says we work. Can you answer me? Number one reason is He works. Number two is  He calls. Number three is He is honored. I really hope you can remember this. Why we work? He works, He calls and He is honored. He is the center at our work place. So dear brothers and sisters, I want you to think about tomorrow when you go to work.Maybe you need to make some phone calls, maybe you need to connect with some people, and maybe you need to teach some students>Whatever it is, think about how can you do it for Gods glory? How can you work for God? How can you apply the teaching that God is working so we work? God is calling us to work so we work. God is honored in our work, so we work for Him. We should remember it is all about Him. It is not about us, it is not about ourselves, and it is not about our own benefits. It is not because of money, power, control or identity, or respect. It is only because of Him, the Lord in the universe. The Lord is our all in all. So dear brothers and sisters, today and the following two weeks we will focus on how to work for God and how to go from seeing work as a burden to be avoided to minimizing our working hard for wrong reasons. Our working for God and experiencing the joy we see in Genesis 1.And now I would like to invite Gary to come up and share how he applies working for God in his work. Gary has more than thirteen years of experience in his working and he has a consulting business here in Beijing and has been living in Beijing since 2004. Since moving in Beijing in 2006, Gary and his wife Lisa have been a part of our English fellowship. Now we welcome Gary. GaryI do not know about you, but I wish shed go for another twenty minutes. Really good thoughts. How do those apply to our life? I am going to talk a little bit about that. But first I would like to thank pastor Wu and Jessica for the opportunity to share in our home church. Gloria mentioned that my wife Lisa is here, our older son, Ben is also attending church here. Hope you know Lisa from talk time. Some of you might know Ben. It is a real privilege to be here. In sharing with you today, I want to emphasize that these are things I have been learning in work, but I think I have been only half way there. I will discuss how we move from this working for the wrong reasons, even trying to avoid work and getting out of work, trying to retire,  or even becoming independently wealthy, so that I can get rid of work. I will then turn to where I am really looking forward to working because I am working for the right reason. I am working for Him. I do not know how far and long I am in this path. I can measure it in years, but only God knows how far I am and maybe half way. I do not want that to be a discouragement to young people. Ok, I think God told me I am a kind of slow learner, so you might pick this up a lot faster. You may have heard it in a much earlier age than I heard it. But God wants us to enjoy work. He wants us to take what we are going to spend more of our waking hours doing than anything else, to take that and do it for His glory. We did a great job on the test. Three things, right? Remember what the three things were? He works, He calls, and He is honored. Let us take a few minutes to look at that. The first one is He works. He created a special in His image. When we work, we can reflect who He is. I really like what the Bible says there. I just do not understand it. I do not understand why a perfect God who created a perfect world who is at work would ask me to do workthat frankly sometimes is incredibly frustrating and frankly sometimes is boring. And sometimes, I experience what He talks about in Genesis 1 at the end of the first day. He looked at His work and He said it is good and at the end of the sixth day, He looked at all the creation that He did, He said it is very good. Have you ever had those feelings? Have you had that feeling of frustration? Or you just cannot wait for the day to be over? Do you ever have the feeling of looking at your work and saying wow, that is good. There is a lot ofsatisfaction in that. It is all inside of work and why is it? Why is it like that? Why is that all of that? The Bible tells us that it was supposed to be like that. In fact, in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2, we see that God created a perfect world and we see God gave Adam and Eve a job. But in Genesis 3:17, we pickit up after the fall, after Adam and Eve have disobeyed God and there we see it says: To Adam, He said because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, you must not eat from it, cursed is the ground because of you, through painful toil, you will eat food from it all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of you brow, you will eat your food. When sin entered this world, it made a huge impact. The Bible says that the ground is cursed. Working in the sinful world becomes burdensome and thats what we experienced. We experienced that God gave us gift of work and satisfied, and we experienced that burden. There are some Chinese words that I really like. My Chinese is not very good. I should tell you. (trouble) is just one of the great words. Work is full of  (trouble).You noticed that? One of my Chinese friends gives a better description as  (to endure pain).Sounds good too, doesnt it? It is burdensome sometimesIf you are a farmer, you know that the ground is hard. You know as soon as you plant the seeds, a battle begins. The weeds start to grow up and they want to choke the plant. The insects and the animals come in and they want to eat the plant. Your entire crop can be wiped out by a disease and there is the weather. It may get too much rain, and it may not get enough rain. Cold may come too early. All of those things that are wars going on to a farmer who just is trying to raise his crops. The ground is cursed and not many of us are farmers., but at least in my work, I found that the ground is cursed. What is it in your job? I work in the United Parcel Service (UPS), the biggest logistic company and I was there for eighteen years. I had numbers of different jobs, but one job I had, it might have been the very best job that I ever had in eighteen years and it was absolutely the worst job I have ever had. Really, I was conflicted in it. OK, UPS is fifty-billion-dollar company. It has four hundred thousand employees and I was working on a team doing strategic planning. We were helping the top executives of the company think about the next five years and think about what we need to do with the technology, what we need to do with the supply chains. And for me, the work really played to my strength. I enjoyed it. I found itincredibly interesting. It was one of the best jobs I have ever had.So what happened? The problem was I was working on a team that was full of people just like Adam and Eve and maybe like you and me, who are working for themselves. They were working for the wrong reasons. They were people who were working for money. They were people who were working for feeling important. They were people who were trying to do as little as possible. Misunderstandings led to hidden and sometimes wide-open conflicts,pride, jealousy, and envy. All these were affecting our ability to work together as a team and to be able to deliver something that in the end of the day, you can look at it and say it is good. It was so frustrating. The ground is cursed. Sin brings burden to the whole area of work. So as the ground is cursed, how did working for God change my job? Think about that. Well, the first difference that I found with working for His glory instead of mine reminded me that I am working on something that is eternal, something thats far bigger than myself, something thats very very important and its worth going through whatever burdens and processes that I have to go through, because it has eternal value. After more than thirty years in the work place, I can tell you that I personally have ongoing joy whenever it is that I worked for His glory.One of the fun things about being here in my home church is, weve got people here in the congregation today who I worked with. And the first thing that I mentioned at the beginning is Ive still got ways to go with this, when I started to work for Him. When I started to think about His glory, it changed things., It helped me get through that hard time. I still had to go through the effect of sin in the work place; I still had to work with that team in strategic planning, but I could experience joy.The second difference is that today, the ground is cursed, but Romans 8: 18-21 tells me that it is a temporary condition; creation was subjected to frustration , but the creation waits eager    expectation that it will be liberated from its bondage. I know that someday Ill experience the freedom of doing work with absolutely none of the burden; Ill experience what God created there   in the Garden. And each one of you as a believer has the same hope. We will someday be going to enjoy them. So the first principle is when I work for God, the ground may be cursed but I can have joy today and I have great hope for the future. The second reason why we work is because He calls us. And when we read it, we know that God tells Adam to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air over every creature that moves on the ground. Have you ever thought about that? I mean what if your boss called you today and said: well we are going to change your job description a little bit today. Today I want you to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground. Here is another Chinese word yalihenda (). Wow, you got to be kidding me! Ive got so much to do! I am not capable of doing that, it is so big and I am so small, I dont know how to do itthings like these just go on and on and on No wonder people look at their jobs often and say I cannot wait for the weekend; I cannot wait for the Spring Festival; I cannot wait till I can retire There is pressure! We are called to serve Him, but theres pressure! There certain parts of work that is burdensome; its hard work and we rely on ourselves, we get stretchedall these things are going on. In Genesis1, God calls us to work, but then in Genesis 2, at the end of the sixth day and the beginning of the seventh day, God says By the seventh day, God completed His work which He had done and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.(Genesis 2:2-3) So after six days of the incredibly created work, it says that God sanctified it. To sanctify means to set it apart. Lets step back just a minute. It does say created the days and rested. You need to ask yourself a question: Did God need to rest? I mean did God say: Oh man those were tough six days. I am really tired and I need to put my feet above and watch movies.I need to get some extra sleep this weekend. I am just going to take a day off. What we know from the Bible that God doesnt get tired, so what is about rest really? He sanctified the day; He set it apart and He told us that we need to celebrate thats Sabbath every week, and we need a Sabbath rest. He didnt do it for Himself but He did it for us. Why do we need Sabbath rest? We need rest everyday, right? If I dont get my sleep, I am pretty cranky. I am not good for much. What is the difference from Sabbath rest? The difference is we need to move from focusing on what we are doing to focus on what God the Father has done and what He is doing. He created all things and He sustained all things. We need to focus on what God the Son has done for us, and on how today He is before the Father pleading for us. We need to focus on how the Holy Spirit comes to give us wisdom and to give us strength to live for God. We need a day to focus off what we are doing and focus on who He is and what He is doing. Now why it is so difficult? Maybe you dont have a hard time but I do. Sometimes I just have a hard time turning off the work. Well sometimes the reason is because I am doing work for the wrong reasons. For instance, if I do some extra work I can make some extra money, or my work becomes so important to me that I begin to think that without me right there managing it,all will fall apart because I am so important. But even if I am not working for myself like that, I really am working for God, there are times when I am worried that I cannot get everything done, does anyone else feel like that? If you ever come to a Saturday and it is just like I dont know if I go to church tomorrow, maybe I will squeeze in the church but then immediately Ive got to do  all of sort of stuff because I just why did God just give us 24 hours a day? And then it tells us to celebrate the Sabbath! Why didnt He give us 28 or 30 hours? When thats the case, it takes faith to trust God that within six days, we can get everything that we need. Jesus encourages us to have our faith in God. He is our provider. Matthew 6:25-33: Therefore I tell you do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear Look at the birds of the air, they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? So do not worry, saying what shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or what shall we wear? For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.Its a step of faith to take a Sabbath rest. The Bible says that God is my provider and He is the one who will take care of me; I can trust Him enough to always take a Sabbath rest. It is an act of faith. So the second principle is: When I work for God, I can take a Sabbath rest and that makes difference when it comes to work also. The third reason why we work is He is honored. As a Christian, naturally I would want to have all of my work honor God. If thats the case, why is it that for so many years, I felt like 80%of my job didnt apply? Just didnt apply! When I looked into the Bible and when I went to church, I was told that in my work life, I should share my faith. Ok, it is an opportunity to share my faith. Secondly, I should work ethically. My ethics should be very high. I should be honest, I should speak the truth. OK,  ethically, I could be salt and light. Third, I could earn money and with that money, I should be generous. OK,  so work is good because it helps me earn money so I could be generous. And then the fourth area, its kind of an indirect message, but make sure that your work hours are as short as possible so that you can go to do sacred work.Have you ever heard the term sacred and secular? Sacred work would be with God, secular work would be what? Without God, right? OK,  so in my mind, I had sacred and I had secular and my job had those two dimensions The problem was that if I did all those things that only took about 20% of my time, the other 80% of my time, I felt like I was over  there  doing things without honoring God. At that time, I was working in UPS as I mentioned and I was doing marketing, I was doing strategic planning, I was involved in the international expansion.I really enjoyed the parts of my work, but my problem was that I didnt see a purpose in it; I didnt see an eternal purpose in it and I didnt see a long-term value in it. As a Christian, why would I want to spend 80% of my working hours in something that did not honor God? That was not important in a long term. The Bible has good news, it says that I can honor God with 100% of my job. What did we see in Genesis1? Gloria mentioned it: God is the one who gave Adam his job, right? Did God say to him I want you to lead Bible studies? Thats sacred work, right? I want you to preach sermons. Thats sacred work; I want you to lead the prayer time. That is sacred work; He said that I want you to go in and manage and I am going to make you a manager; I am going to make you a steward; I am going to make you over farming. God doesnt have this separation of sacred and secular; God sees all work as sacred. Remember what Colossians 3 said: Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters. In these verses, that pastor Pauls telling all workers and in this case even slaves, to work is onto the Lord, The Bible teaches us that even most simple unimportant task can be sacred when they are done for His glory. Another way of saying this is: All work is holy, when it is done wholly for Him. So the third principle is when I work for God, every part of my work can glorify God. So why do you work? Is it for money? Is it for identity? Respect? Power? If you think this morning that those are primary reasons, you know who you are working for. I know who I am working for when I do that. I am working for myself! There are many in China today who are in the process of finding out that automatically they will never satisfy the hole in their hearts. A wise person once was asked: what is the greatest failure in life? Would it be attempting to climb the ladder of success and then failing to reach your goal? The wise person answered: it is absolutely not. The greatest failure in life would be that given  everything to climb that ladder of success all the way to the top, only to find out it was a leaning against the wrong wall. If you are not a Christian this morning, your ladder of success is leaning against the wrong wall; you will never find what you are looking for apart from Jesus. I would like to encourage you today to make a decision to follow Jesus, I would encourage you that after this service, there is a prayer team up here, come up and talk to them.You cannot glorify God and live for Him unless you know Him. If you are a Christian and you are still working for the wrong reasons, ask the Lord to show you this morning what they are. Lord, show me where it is that I am working for myself instead of working for you; I want to live for your glory. If you are a Christian, you want to go deeper working for His glory. Remember the three things we talked about here, the application: the ground may be cursed but I can experience joy today and I have a great hope for the future; I can have the faith to take a Sabbath rest; every part of my work can be done in His glory no matter how small it is, no matter how difficult it is, how unnoticed it is.Let me close with this story: When I was in UPS, we lived in Europe for several years, and a friend of mine took me to see a very old and very beautiful church (showing the pictures of the church}. The churchs over a hundred meters tall and it actually took 70 years to build. It was actually completed by the grandsons of the man who started the church. So for three generations, they worked on this. It is a gorgeous building and I noticed that over the doorway, theres incredible stone work. My friend pointed at the stone work over the entrance to the very top of the building and he said: you cannot see it from here, but a hundred meters up, the stone work is just as detailed and just as high quality. He said but few people had ever seen it before. And I asked myself: well, if very few people could see it, why did the  wormen do that? He simply said: They were working for God! You and I have that privilege to work for God for His glory. Lets encourage each other to settle for absolutely nothing less. Thank you. PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 12"

It is the Lord Christ you are serving.Today, Pastor Rachel is going to share a sermon with us entitled What is the Right Attitude about Work. Lets welcome her.Pastor Rachel:IntroductionGood morning, dear brothers and sisters. I am so happy that we can share Gods Word together today. We started a series of sermons called At Word last Sunday. From that we know Why do we work? Because God works, because God calls, and He is honoured through our work. Because work is a calling from God, God works, and He expects people to do the same. So today, we will focus on What is the right attitude about work.Lets discover together some biblical principles when we reflect on these verses. First, Christians should work hard or diligently. Once I listened to a sermon, the priest said that our God works very hard, He created this universe. And when our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world, He did not choose to be a philosopher, artist or CEO or other well  paid personnel, but chose to be a carpenter to work with His hands. This should make us think about our attitude toward work. Sometimes we think that work is a chore, work is a burden, so we do not wan to work, or we do not like our jobs, and we complain how boring our job is. And sometimes, we become lazy and seek to avoid work if we can. But here, the problem is not what kind of work you do, but your attitude to it. In Genesis chapter 1, we learn that God is a God who works, and He delights in His work. Genesis 1: 31 says,God saw all that He had made, and it was very good.Christians must not be lazy. Ecclesiastes 9: 10 says,Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.Romans 12: 11,Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spirit fervor, serving the Lord.This is a value in all kinds of work. As Christians, we should work diligently.Second, Christians should work honestly. Some people may think that work is a way to increase our status, or a pathway to make money or wealth. But as Christians, we know that work is a calling from God. So we are not just working for our masters, but working for our God. Ephesians 6: 5-6,Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.Obey them not only to win their favour when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men,because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.Here Paul calls people to examine two areas of life in our workplace, outward performance and inner heart. Paul directs us to consider carefully the expectations of those for whom we work. Work does mean to obey our earthly masters with respect and fear. The person who performs well only win the prizes of the boss, but not quality. To work under an employer or supervisor does mean that at the end of the day, my work must please him or her. His or her expectation becomes the standard of my job. But here Paul says that our God is the supervisor no matter what kind of job we do, no matter what kind of work we do, we should please our God. No matter who is your boss, the real boss is God, and the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does. In Colossians chapter 3, verse 23 to 24 says,Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men,since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.I know there are many brothers and sisters who have their jobs and also serve at church. When they go to work, they are excellent workers, and good testimony of God. When they serve at church, they serve others with all their heart, because they can serve God both at their workplace and at church. So what is our attitude about work? Some reflections here:How does the gospel impact your life at work? Are you happy in your work? What would you change about your job or attitude towards it?Third, Christians should rest from work. If we use some words to describe this world, what shall we say? I think it is hurry, busy and worry. Think about it, usually, when we call each other, or when we see each other, what is our first sentence? Is it ok for you to take my call? Are you busy now? Do you have time? It seems like there are so many things we need to do and we do not have time to rest. But you know what? God rest from His work. Genesis 2: 2-3,By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.In fact, the rest is not because God needed a break in order to regain His strength; He is without limit and never exhausts. The principle of this day is given to us because we do not have infinite energy to continuously work without rest. God has created a nature to include the Sabbath. Even the lands and the animals need rest. All that God has made requires break from normal activities. Exodus 34: 21 says,Six days you shall labour, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the ploughing season and harvest you must rest.Sometimes we cannot stop; work goes crazy, because we think there are so many needs. But Jesus told us, Do not worry about what you need in your daily life. It does not mean that you need not work, it means that you should trust God. Some things are necessary in our daily life, but some are not. But we usually get confused over what is necessary in our daily life. So we work too hard to get what we desire to get.If you are very successful in your job, but you do not have time to take care of your family, if you do not have time to play with your kids, and if you do not have time to worship God, what a pity! Isaiah 58: 13-14 says,If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the LORD's holy day honourable, and if you honour it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words,then you will find your joy in the LORD, and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob.Maybe today we are not observing the Sabbath as it is commanded in the Old Testament, but still, we need to think about how we balance our (personal) time and job. Work is just a part of our life, it is not the whole life. But some people today, they treat work as the purpose of their lives. so they become the slaves of money or work. If we think we could prove ourselves by work, we could never get real rest.Two weeks ago, I went with a mission partner to preach, and I met a brother. When I saw him, I asked him how his job was. And he said he really thanked God, during the interview for his new job, he told the boss that he was a Christian and he needed to worship God on Sundays. So if they give Sunday off to him, he would accept the new job. And they said yes. When this brother shared his story with me, I was so encouraged by his faith. Maybe this man may not be successful, maybe he may not make a lot of money, but he is certainly a wise man, because he knows he needs rest. God has created the nature to include the Sabbath. How can we balance our time?Fourth, Christians have honors and glorify God through work.Lets see a picture. You know this man, right? Just now Cathy mentioned about him. He is very popular and famous now. He is a rising NBA star and a devout Christian. He has said this, I am not working hard and practicing day in and day out so that I can please other people. My audience is God. And in another interview, he said, I am really passionate about Christianity. And help others. There is beauty in seeing people change their lives for the better. Good stuff, right? I think the relationship at your workplace needs to be developed with grace and forgiveness too. Rebuilding this presence of Lord in our work is powerful and transforming. The person who daily recognizes the presence of Christ in all of life will have transforming impact upon others. For Christians we are working for Gods glory and to help others. Some Reflections:How often do you pray for those with and for whom you work?What changes might occur if you lived your faith in the workplace?In what ways do you believe that God will use you in the lives of others with whom you work?How do you reveal the presence of God in your life and place of work?We need to think about it. The last one, Christians depend on Christ in their work.Psalm 127:1-2,Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain. In vain you rise early and stay up late. Toiling for food to eat - for He grants sleep to those He loves. These verses remind me of a man named Joseph in the Old Testament. He was the younger and favored son of Jacob. However, his brother sold him to Ishmaelite slave traders. They took him to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar, one of Pharaohs officials. He was forced to live and work in the most difficult circumstances, but the Bible told us later, the quality of his work, with the trust of Potiphar, lead to significant promotions, he was placed to in charge of the entire estate. This slave became the master of Potiphars household and all his possessions. When Potiphars wife falsely accused him of an attempted rape, Joseph was put in prison and had to do the prisoners work. He won the favourable attention and trust of the warden, this slave was placed to be in charge of the entire prison, the warden.  And the chief jailer entrusted everything to Josephs oversight. What could possibly cause this man who had been treated with so much injustice for so many years to exemplify such work excellence?Genesis 39:23,Because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in everything he did.When we go to work, it is not just simply about we go to work by ourselves. And if we think we can do a good job by ourselves, its not true. God is the one who watches over the city, God is the one who builds the house, God is the one who makes you sleep, God is the one who helps you and goes with you in your workplace and in your daily life.ConclusionLet us: thank our God for our job,Pray for whom we work,Keep our eyes upon our Savior, especially when it comes to our work,May we experience Him and bring glory to Him in our daily life.Well, I know there is a brother who has been working for more than thirty years. And now I would like to invite brother Wang to share about his experience with us. Welcome him.Brother WangHallelujah, praise the Lord, I am really touched by the worship and I think it is a wonderful thing when we sing all for you, all because of you. Because we stand here today, not because we are strong, or we are intelligent, or because we are wise, whatever; I mean, simply because of dear Jesus Christ, because of Him we can hear, we can testify for Him how great is our Lord and every aspect in our life. Praise the Lord. And I am also very encouraged to see so many young faces here and we all expect to live our life productively and to live our life to His glory. And before I start, I would like to have a little bit of introduction of myself. I am sixty-one year old, Ive been working for thirty-five year, and two years military service. And I started work for Texas Instrument as production supervisor and cost accounting analyst, and then I did my job in the IT industry, and I worked for Johnson & Johnson for three years, only to computerize the company in operation back in Taiwan. And then I worked twelve years for Motorola on the production as well as on the region Asia - wise network. So there is my career life. And I stopped my corporate life and started my own business in 1999. And I live here for seventeen years now. So basically, I have been working all my life, but gradually I am changing a little bit. I started working very much for career. I spent about seventy percent of my time in severing the Lord. So thats how I did. I have been on the production floor, so I know what is productivity, what is efficiency. I have been financial analyst, so I know what is money, and how to calculate the costs, how to drive the cost down and everything like that. And I have been on high-tech and basically on the computer from the very beginning I am talking about, say about twenty-five years ago. A lot of you may not even have been born at that time yet. So, (I have experienced) every aspect in the corporate life, and also as a businessman. But after all this, I was very touched by a presentation by a company I visited. The president made a presentation, talking about three things he was looking into: how he evaluated people. I mean, how do you evaluate people? One fundamental thing is that he must have a faith. He must have a passion for something. That is the whole purpose of his living, including his work. So the foundation is the faith. And the second thing he talked about is, how do you interact with the others, how do you treat the others, how do you work with the others. The third thing maybe very minor, also it is very important, but not as important as the other two -- the third one is your skill, your work skill, your computer, how good are you in computer and everything. So these three things: the foundation is your faith, the second thing is how do you interact with the others, and the third thing is your skill. The way I look at it, he (the president) is not a Christian, they all knew I was a Christian. So (while) I was seating the board, a lot of times, they asked me how I felt as a Christian on this kind of thing. I think one fundamental thing about your faith, the way I see it is your passion, what do you live for? What is the purpose of your work today? What is the purpose to have a family? What is the purpose you breathe in, breathe out everyday, every minute on this earth? what are you living for? If you dont have a passion, a lot of times, I see, is that I cannot (understand). I sometimes feel sad. I may have been happy for a small success, but a lot of times I feel very sad about my failure. But if you have a passion, lots of times, it doesnt matter anymore, you just live every minute; you know what you are living for. The success or the failure doesnt matter, doesnt count any more, because you know every minute you are living for something, you are (moving) forward to the direction, you know thats right, that is what you are living for. So the small thing doesnt matter any more, and this is exactly how I feel about the way I live today. I know there is a passion and the passion can support you, that passion can guide you to the direction that you are aiming. So that one most important thing is the passion, And the way I see it is that Jesus Christ, He made a prayer in John gospel, chapter seventeen, and He talked about,I thank you, I glorify you by doing the work you give to me. (John 17: 4)Basically there is something (in that) God gives our life living in this world that we have a purpose. We know something we are living for, and thats exactly what we should target at.That becomes the passion. That becomes the foundation of everything that we do. If you do not have that kind of passion, our foundations, a lot of times, will get up and down. Very easily, you can get frustrated, you can get disappointed. The way I see, every time I feel disappointed or frustrated, I will go back to my foundation, to my faith, and say, Lord, help me, because I live for you, because here is something I want to live for your glory. Whatever I do, forget about the gain or loss, dear Lord, I want you to be glorified, I want your name to be known by the people around me so that I can live for your glory. This is exactly (what we should try to do). And also in the Bible, it does indeed tell us we all are priests. We are the one to bring God to the people around us; we are also the one to bring people to God. So that is our role. And every time, when I see that, I behave, I act, or whatever I respond to this world, I try very hard, or I try my best (do not get me wrong, I do have failures), but a lot of time, I do want to say Lord, I do want you to guide me, to let me to live more of you, to let people know more about you.The second thing about my attitude toward work. The Linsanity is a very good thing for us to ponder, to see and think about. His performance is not only the sport, not only the points. A lot of times, his performance is based on to assist, how much assistance he supports the others to succeed. The more I see, the more important to talk about the way you interact with the others. A lot of times, we want to make ourselves more announced to the others; a lot of times, we want to raise ourselves among the other people. But in the Bible, it does say we are the servant. We are the one to serve, we are the one to deliver, to help. Even when I was in the high level of the corporate life, I always see my role, even as a manager. My job is not to teach every one to do their job; I always see my job as the one to arrange the resources, or the necessary advice to help my staff to do their work. In other word, we are the servant. We are not the one high above to dictate to do this to do that; we are the one to work together, to help, to get things done. And I always see during my career when I see my staff, I know what kind of people I would like to help, to grow. And if the one is very selfish, or tries to hide everything behind something, and does not share it with the others. Those are the ones that I have difficulties with. And I always see that if you are open, you are frank, and you are helpful, and you are willing to hand out your hand to help others. Those are the ones that I always see as having a great potential. And in my career life, I have to say that each time, I am not selfish, I try to help, to work with others, to work together, I always see the servant attitude is very helpful to grow yourselves. So it is not how good you are, it is always (being) open and frank and try to help the others. And also, be confident of yourselves because the way I see it is that, I only see only 2.5% of super-intelligent, 2.5% of not so smart, but most of us, all of us here, we are of the similar intelligence, but we have to work very hard to improve ourselves. If you have the passion and the right attitude, then I think we can do a lot of work. And talking about we are all working for the Lord, I have to say one thing, one attitude in my career life that I feel very important  I will never allow my boss, my supervisor or my leaders to worry for my work. I am the one responsible for whatever I do. So I will not let some one to worry for my work, my responsibility. You have to hold it very tight and say that is what I do. Especially, when we are living our life, our working life to glorify the Lord, in that sense, no one can disgrace our Lord because of our performance if we try everything possible, everything to do our work diligently without disgracing the Lord. I have seen a lot of times, I have to say, unfortunately, in my observation that a lot of Christians working for a Christian boss. A lot of time they have excuses to say oh well, I have to read the Bible; I cannot do overtime; I cannot do this simply because I have to do something for the Lord. I have difficulty to deal with that kind of situation. I know that a lot of times we have to live our spiritual life faithfully, I do know that. I also know that we have the responsibility to glorify our Lord in our work regardless that we have to do it very hard. The Lord can be glorified through our work. And one thing I have to say is that we have the confidence in our Lord that whatever we do, if others can do, we also can do, and we can do better. That is also, as I see, Christians attitude toward work. Also, about your work, see a bigger picture. If you see a small picture, if you see what gain or loss at that particular instance, particular project, particular moment, then we can easily get frustrated. If you see a higher level picture, then you can see that Lord, I have come here in this world. I live for a purpose. I want to demonstrate that our Christians live our lives very productively and wisely. Then in a lot of times, we have to see a higher picture. In that sense, we do not have to worry too much about momentary gain or loss as we can see a higher picture. The way I see it, if you have a bigger picture, or if you see something on a higher level, suddenly, you can do a lot of better things because you have the direction right. You can do it a lot more wisely, and you wont be frustrated or disappointed by a small momentary loss. So you will have a wider heart, a more intelligent adviser to live your life more productively.One thing I always say is that you need to have a longer picture; you need to look as far as you can. A way that I measure people is that how far can you plan. Lets say, if they only look at what to do today, what to do this afternoon, if that is all you can see, then a lot of times, we are very small, and we can be easily tied into very small thing. We wont have an open heart, a big heart. The way I see it is that, the longer you plan, the longer you look, the further away you have a vision, the better.For Christians, we are looking for this world, we are looking at what the Lord can give us so that we can live a mission, that we can glorify the Lord eventually in the very eternity that we can get His reward.So, the way I see it is that you have to work with a purpose, with passion; and you have to treat the others, the people around you, as a servant, to help them, to work with them. Do not worry about yourselves, and also to live that the people around you would feel comfortable when you are there. That is exactly the way I see Jeremy is doing. I do not think he is a terrific player. He is a player because he can play very well with the others. He can help the others to be successful. And more importantly, he can help the team to be successful. If we have the mentality, I think the Lord will be glorified with our work. And also we have to work very diligently, with passion. Whatever you do, be confident, that the Lord will always give us the right wisdom and intelligence as we learn to have the right attitude, we can do the work much more productively and efficiently, and make it a success. At the end, the Lord will be honoured in whatever we do; and this is exactly the purpose that we are working for.One more thing I would say is that, be balanced, have a very balanced life. Because (his phone rings/vibrates) the hand phone to me is a curse, but it is also a blessing. It takes away 24/7 of life, and that is not really a wise thing to do. And we do not need to be working by 24/7 because I do not believe it will help us to be a successful person. We have to be wise; we have to look at a longer and bigger picture, because we do not have to make every minute at work, because who is looking after us? Our dear God! He takes care of the sparrows, he will take care of you. So leave it to Him. A lot of times, when I felt worried, I always said to the Lord, as a boy, Lord, you are the boss; you are the one; you look after me; I dont have to worry. Thank you Lord. When you have the mentality, suddenly you will feel relieved, relaxed; and you will feel happy; you feel confident; you feel yes, there is a purpose for me; I will live happily; and you can help others very pleasantly. Suddenly, you feel that you could the Jeremy Lin in your team! You will not only be successful for yourself, you can help your team to be successful. At the end, every one is happy; and our Lord will be happy.

We will live for you, we will die for you and we will do whatever you call us to do, because you first loved us. So bless our time together and we pray in Jesus name. AmenTodays the beginning of a new series: walking in the light as the children of light and we study the book of Ephesians. Our first chapter is about the God of all blessing. When I am asked about what is the most meaningful blessing in life, I have to respond the birth of our children. In the hospital, we had an opportunity to be in the room where our children were born and its a miracle; its totally amazing; its something thats incomparable to see from your wife, the emergence, head first, and then shoulders and then body of a little baby who had been kicking inside for the last nine months and now out, shaking and singing its lungs out. I cannot tell you what a joy it is to experience birth; it is nothing like what you have experienced before. Its a joy and a memory that is indelible and that has to be one of the great blessings from God. Now we know that physical birth is very exciting and spiritual birth is also very exciting! It is so exciting that the heavens hold a party! The heavens are filled with a great joy, singing and celebrating when one sinner repents and says: Jesus Ive found you. You are mine and I am yours. You are my Savior and you are my Lord. The Fathers heart fills with joy and heavens celebrate. We are going to be talking about thisspiritual birth as we journey in this Book.One way to know what this Book is about is to look at the repeated words, to see what themes or ideas are repeated. I did a very quick tabulation and not surprisingly, top of the list is In Christ, In Him, in the Lord, in the  spirit, and in God. Second is Lord, 22 times; Love, 16 times; Grace, 11times and Body and Church, 11 and 9 times. So we know that what Gods going to teach us in this Book is about new life in Christ, His love, and His grace and how we as children of Light can live together as a Body  His church! If I were to divide this Book up into three divisions, we can say: Wealth, Walk and Warfare. Our division for the first section of our study is also in three parts: Selected, Saved and Sealed. Lets go into the Scriptures and see what treasures God desires to place in your life.Ephesians 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus: Right off, we are told that the human author is Paul, he was formally known as Saul, the Pharisee and the persecutor of the Church. Right after Jesus died on the cross and rose again, we see Saul fuming: I dont like those Christians! They are taking us away from the true faith. So he set off to the Damascus to arrest those Christians. On his way, God arrested Paul, threw him off his horse and blinded him with His glorious light and revealed Himself as JesusLord of all. Jesus who died and Jesus who now is alive! Paul, through this conversion, moved from a persecutor to a preacher. Wherever he went, he would preach: Jesus is alive!! The One whom I persecuted, He is alive!! He is God! Not only did he become a preacher of the church and the gospel, but he became the prisoner. He said I am willing to be bound, not only bound, but I am willing to die for my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. So we see that this is Paul, once a persecutor becoming a preacher and then a prisoner of Christ. He says that he is an apostle who is sent by God to preach the Good News. There are so much bad news, but now we have Good News! The best news ever that Jesus is God. He says I come with the authority of being an apostle, not because I chose to, but because God called me. It is by His will that I am an apostle. He was the one who arrested me on the way to Damascus; He is the one who entrusted the message of salvation to me. So I am here by His will because thats where I want to bein the center of Gods will. There is no safer place than being in Gods will. He says I am writing to the church, the saints in Ephesus. Saints are holy ones, not perfect ones on earth, but ones who God has set aside, set apart for His purpose. Not to live for ourselves, but to live for Him. All things were created by Him, through Him and for Him. Our purpose is for Him. He says Ephesus. Ephesus is located at the western coast in Turkey. It was a prosperous port, very rich and it was the fourth greatest city in the Roman Empire with a whopping 300,000 population, it was the largest in its province. Now by our standards, 300,000 is very small, isnt it? But in those times, it made Ephesus a very large city and it had one of the seven wonders of the world. There was a temple dedicated to the goddess Artemis in Greek, Diana in Latin. And this is goddess fertility, the goddess who would give good luck for new life. We know it was actually the goddess of sexual immorality. Paul, inspirited by the Spirit, writes to this church, where they live in the city which is prosperous and very religious and sexually immoral. And he says: they are the faithful in Christ Jesus. Faithful means full of faith in Jesus Christ. Not what we do, but what God does. It is not a relief? It is not about what we do, it is about what God Himself does, and has done and will do. It is all about God. Ephesians 1:2 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. God, our Father, emphasizes our intimate family relationship with God. The Father and the Lord equates the divine nature in both Father and Son. Ephesians 1:3, Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.This is exciting! This is the best news! Isnt it? Our Father and our Lord, they have chosen to bless us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms. Heavenly realms as Pauls earthly realms are to emphasize that these are spiritual blessings. Spiritual blessings dont perish. Spiritual blessings are eternal. Spiritual blessings are the most valuable. The verb, has blessed us is in the past tense, telling us that God has done this fact. It is a fact. It is reality. We have every blessing that we need for godly living, for living the spiritual life that God calls us to. Every spiritual blessing, not some, not a portion, but all! Our Father is gracious! Our Father is generous! Our Father wants to give you everything. And He does. He gives you everything. And He has given you everything. Because you no longer live in the earthly realms, but you and I who believe, we live in the new realm. Yes, we live on earth but we live in Jesus! We are now transferred from the kingdom of darkness to the Kingdom of Light--in Christ, a new era, a new kingdom with its new rules. We are new creation. All has gone and the new has come. Ephesians1:4 For He chose us in Christ before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in His sight.   One of the first blessings is His selection of us. Isnt that amazing? Even before we came into the world, even before we had done anything, God chose you. He chose me. He chose us. I am not very athletic. And at school, I was always picked last for the soccer team. Who wants the fat guy? I was the fat guy on the soccer field. They could hear me coming: Pang! Pang! Pang! Here comes the fat guy. I was always picked last, because there is nobody else to choose. But God does not choose you last. He has thought about you. And he says I want you. I have chosen you to be the object of my love. I chose you before the foundation of the world. Thats a long time. A very long time, he has been thinking about you. And you are not an accident. He has planned you. He knitted you together little by little, bit by bit. And he has brought you into the world. And you are who you are by the grace of God. It says that he chose us for a purpose. He chose us to be holy, to be more like Jesus; to be more like Christ; to be so identifiable that people see Jesus in you. They say Hey, I saw Jesus at work! I saw Jesus in the bus! I saw Jesus on the subway! Because you live in Jesus and Jesus just overflows from you. He wants you to be holy one with Him. You see Jesus is the only one who delighted the Father perfectly. And he says: I want you to be my delight. I want to be delighted in you. And I want you to be like Jesus.   He also says I want you to be blameless. This was the word that is used here and it is to describe the sacrifices offered to God.Sacrifices without blemish, pure, clean. So He did not create us or choose us for ourselves but for His praise and glory. He chose us so that we would be holy and blameless in His sight, not our standards, not our measurements, but in His sight and His perfect standards. Ephesians1:5 In love He predestined us to be adopted as His sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with His pleasure and will.God dose everything in love. Isnt it? God is love. He is perfect love, unfailing love, unending love, unconditional love, unlimited love. If you feel unloved, if you feel lonely, if you feel you know my mom or my dad, or my brother, my sister they dont love me. You have One in the heaven who says I love you. I love you. I love you.He used the word predestined to show that its unshakable and its unbreakable. What I have chosen to do, no one can change. What I have done in eternality, nothing in time can change. What did He predestine us to do? To be adopted. According to Roman law, for what I understand, an adopted child had higher value than your natural child. You may have an unwanted pregnancy, but typically speaking, when you adopt someone, its deliberate; it is intentional. And God is saying I did not make a mistake. I adopt you. And I am going to bring you into my family. You were once a stranger, you were once an enemy, you once hated me. But I choose to adopt you to be part of my family. Not only do you become a part of the family but you become sons. You receive the full rights of sons. Everything that the son gets, you get.  Thats right. You receive all that Jesus has. Everything! But I am not at the same level as Jesus. No, I am not. But Jesus Father says I am your Dad too. And since you are my son, you get everything too. All the rights, all the privileges that found in Christ are ours. I feel so unworthy. I feel so unworthy.God is the one who makes us worthy. God is the one who qualifies us. Not we, not what we can do, not what we can say, not what we appear to be. He makes us worthy. And the reason for all of the choosing and adopting is verse six.Ephesians 1:6 to the praise of His glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the One he loves.The principle for this section is found in James1:17. Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.Every good and perfect gift is from God. It comes from the father who created the stars, who created the universe, who created the sun. He says the shadows shift. But I who created the sun and the shadows do not change. What I have said is perfectly true. What I have promised is perfectly true. And it is impossible for me to lie. Its impossible for God to lie and all His promises find for fulfillment in Christ. If you are in Christ, you will receive this wonderful inheritance. So the question that I have for you then is: How will Gods innumerable blessings change the way you live? If God has given us so much, what is going to change?  Id like to see that, first of all, an attitude adjustment. We should be the most joyful people, the most thankful people in the whole world. We have been chosen, and we have been adopted, and we have eternal blessings that cannot be taken away from us, we are the most blessed people in the whole world; we are the most beloved people in the whole world; we are the richest people in the whole world. An attitude adjustment. Will people call you joyful? Will people consider you a grateful  person? I believe that we should start looking at life and seeing each experience as a good and perfect gift from our loving Father. So lets pray together:I adore you everlasting Creator and FatherI confess I have lovedYour gifts more than YouThanks for personally selecting & adopting meI pray for power to stand for the Truth at all cost.Not only an our attitude adjustment, I believe we must be known as truth defenders. We must stand for the Truth, live for the Truth and die for Truth because Jesus is the way, the truth and the life. How do all of these happen? How do we get in Christ? Ephesians 1:7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of Gods grace.In Him, in Christ, how did we get in Christ? How did we end up having a new relationship with God? When we were running away from God, when we were enemies of God, when we had no interest in God, when we loved the darkness more than light? How could this happen? Jesus willingly came and redeemed us. The word redemption has the idea of buying back, something that you owed; and the idea of deliverance, delivering a slave, freeing a slave. So when I think about redemption, there are two aspects in the Old Testament. One aspect is deliverance by power which we saw when God delivered the people powerfully out of Egypt, and then deliverance by payment, we see that in the book of Ruth where He pays for Ruth. So Jesus sees us as slaves, you might say: Im not a slave. Im a free man, Im a free woman, a free child, and this is a free country, but there are two types of people: salves to the world system and slaves to God, which one are you? All of us were born as slaves to the world, enemies of God. But because Jesus says: I want to buy you back, because you are really my own, and I am going to pay the full price for you, and it will cost me my life, and it will cost me death on the cross; He willingly dies for you; he willingly dies for me. He says thats how I will buy you back; thats how I am going to give you a new life; thats how I am going to transform you from darkness to light; thats how you are going to become a new creation. So He says without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness, and thats how  we get in Christ. God says all the sins you committed against me, I forgive you, all! The dirty is canceled, you don't own me any thing and I have forgiven you; I not just cover your sins,  but I remove them from you, as far as east from the west, you have no more fear or condemnation when you are coming to my presence. You are now in Christ and you have been forgiven. So the blessing here is our redemption, free from slavery of sin, brought into the Kingdom of Light, and then forgiveness of sins. And He does this in accordance with the riches of God's grace which He lavished on earth through wisdom and understanding. The principle for this particular section is: Present salvation does not remove the presence of sin in life but the power of sin over life. Salvation has three aspects, the past, God has removed the penalty of sin, the present, God has removed the power of sin, and then the future, God will remove the presence of sin. We no long have to sin, because we have Christ and all the blessing and power we need for Godly living. So my question to you is: How will you deal with the sins you are struggling with? Even though we have access to all these powers, all this wealth, all these blessings, all these riches, if we go privately, we find in our hearts that we are not perfect, and we still continue to hurt, and grieve the one who loves us so infinitely. I believe prayer and the Word of God are our weapons.2 Corinthians10:4-5 Our weapons have divine power to demolish strongholdsand every pretensionagainst the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. Do you feel struggling with sins in your life? Do you just want to know why it makes me fall so often? I believe the Lord has given us the power to overcome through prayer, speaking to God through His Word; His Word is power of God from salvation to all who believe. So let us pray the last four lines here.I adore you risen and exalted Lamb of GodI confess prayer has become an empty ritualThank you for your infinite love and sacrificeI pray I will love the lost and forgive my enemiesI just want to end with a little story herewe talked about birth, we talked about spiritual birth and love of God. Someone told me about a family and this family adopted a childNow we know that in China many people come here to adopt children, they spent a lot of time and a lot of resources to adopt children here, because children here are so lovable and adorable, and they want to participate in Gods plan to introduce the gospel to the children of China.I remember a couple, who adopted a child, but the child was in a very severe health condition. This child had a mom overdosed on cocaine and because of the overdose, this child became blind, the child was deaf, the child could not speak or move. ?? pretty much, and this child you have to do everything for him, blow the nose, do the bathroom, activities. The parents never heard of the child singing, and  never received a hug from this child. This child was the object of their love; this child was the one they adopted. When I think about their love for this child, I'm totally blown away; I think who would adopt a disaster? Who would adopt a child that is blind? But you know, you and I are sinners. Wecan't see, we can't talk, we can't move, we can do nothing, we are just dead spiritually, and God says: I will adopt you, because I love you with the infinite love and unconditional love and unlimited love. I pray that today you will consider God's love and God's blessings  afresh and you will give your heart to Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and you will know today will be your birthday, your spiritual birthday, and you will be born in Christ, filled with every spiritual blessing in Christ. May God bless you and see you next time. PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 1"

Lord, thank you for making us one community of Christians from many nations, so we are one body united in Christ. Jesus, thank you for dying for us, thank you for washing away all our sins. Lord, please open the eyes of our hearts, so we may see you and know you more. I pray for the worship team, host team, song team and all the other volunteers who are serving in this service. May you strengthen them and bless their hearts. Holy Spirit come upon us, please lead us into Gods presence. Lord, I lift up today's preacher before you, please speak to us through her sermon. May your name be glorified. In Jesus Name, Amen!Open My EyesMy dear brothers and sisters, I'm so happy that we can get together to worship our God. We can hear from Him and our eyes can be opened by Him. Let's pray altogether. Dear Lord, thank you so much for the great blessing which you have already promised us and also given us. Lord Jesus Christ, we just want to ask you, please be with us, not only when we get together praising you and worshipping you, but also be with us when we are alone. Lord Jesus, please open our eyes and let us see your glory; please open our eyes when we cannot see your glory. Lord Jesus Christ, I want to lift up all of our brothers and sisters here in your hands, you know our heart and you know our situations. God today I just ask you please send the Holy Spirit upon us and work in our hearts; open our eyes so that we can see, open our mind so that we will know you better; and we will know the hope of your calling, we will know the glory, inheritance and incomparable power in Jesus Christ. We ask you to let us feel your presence, we pray In Jesus Name. Amen.Dear brothers and sisters, I just feel so powerful when all people get together singing praise to our Lord, I feel its such a wonderful thing that we can get together to worship Him and praise Him. But we cannot get together all day, all night; we cannot get together at anytime we want. You know after this service, we will go back to our own places, and we will be facing our own problems. One day, one of my sisters came to me and she shared her bad situation with me: Her dad died when he was about 40-year old. She was crying and she told me that she did want to trust in God; she did want to trust that Gods the powerful and Almighty God, but she couldnt understand why this thing happened to him; she couldnt understand why the powerful God couldnt save her father; she was wondering if the merciful God loved her, why He allowed this to happen in her life? I was sitting in front of her and I know that words were so weak, I couldnt comfort her. What I could do was just keeping in silence and listening, and also I prayed from my heart for her and for myself: Lord, please open our eyes so that we can see. Now please open our eyes so that we can understand, please encourage us and strengthen us even though we cannot understand or see, and help us trust in you. Thats why today I am going to focus on: Open my eyes"", Ephesians1:17-23.Dear brothers and sisters, we know since last Sunday we have started another new series of sermons focusing on Ephesians. Our purpose is to encourage all of us to live as children of light. Last Sunday, Stephen shared with us about chapter 1:1-8 entitled God of all blessing. But when we continue to read chapter 1, we find out that at end of chapter1, there is a very important prayer from Paul for the people in Ephesus. Why is there a prayer? From my own understanding, the first part of this chapter shares all the spiritual blessings God gives us, and all the blessings have already prepared for us even before the Creation. But our Lord Jesus Christ still wants us to experience these blessings in our daily life when we live on this earth, so this prayer wants us to experience our Gods power and hope and His inheritance in this present age, not only eternal time, but also right now. Thats why Paul said: I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation so that you may know Him better. I pray also that the eyes of your hearts may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope and other different things. Sometimes in our daily life, we couldnt see the blessing; we couldnt experience the power, and we think when we do Gods will, when we do the right thing, we cant get reward. Thats why Paul prayed that open our eyes so that we will know Him better. We will see the hope, we will know the inheritance, and we will experience the incomparable power. Dear brothers and sisters, if our eyes are not opened, we will walk in darkness, we cannot understand the power and preciousness of Gods salvation plan through Jesus Christ; if our eyes are opened by the Holy Spirit, we will know the hope; we will experience His power and we will know the eternal inheritance of our Lord Jesus Christ. I will share with you one by one about the three things we will see. The first is the hope of His calling. Hope is very important to everyone who lives on this earth, if we dont have any hope, we will be unhappy, we cant live anymore. As Bernard Shaw had said that there are two major causes for unhappiness: you cannot get what you hope to get, or you have gotten what you hoped to get. This is very interesting, first thing is that you cannot get what you hope to get.We will agree on that because if we couldnt get what we hope or dream to get, we will feel it like a disaster and we feel unhappy, but he said that you have already gotten what you hoped, you also feel unhappy. Why?  Because the hope from this earth can't give us satisfaction. Like the earthly things. But dear brothers and sisters, God walks through in Jesus Christ by Holy Spirit and the hope He gives us is eternal hope, and this hope is different from the earthly hope, this hope is higher than all other hopes. That's why in Romans, Paul said that be rejoicing always not only when you are happy but also rejoice in sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us (Romans5:3-5). This is the experience of the eternal hope, when we have the eternal hope, we will rejoice when we are in good situation; we will rejoice when we encounter bad situations. That's why Paul encouraged all the believers not only so but also rejoice in sufferings, because it can produce persevere, character and hope, this hope will not disappoint us. This is the eternal hope.Dear brothers and sisters, when you are called by our Lord, and you will have this eternal hope, I know even myself sometimes feel hopeless, today as we are reading this part of this Scripture, I find that my eyes need to be opened by the Holy Spirit. Because when my eyes were blinded, I couldn't see the hope. So today if anyone here, no matter you are a Christian or not, feels hopeless; if you worry about a lot of things, today this hope is for you, because this hope is eternal hope, and this hope will not let you be disappointed.Second is Gods glorious inheritance in the Son, this is also very important and this is what Paul prayed for the people who believe in Jesus Christ, when our eyes are opened, we will see the riches of Gods glorious inheritance in the Son who God called for those who believe in Jesus Christ. Sometimes I saw people like this, even myself, when we do God's will, we will be treated unfairly, and then at this time, we will feel bad and we will be discouraged. So we think that maybe next time I will not do God's will, I will follow others. But dear brothers and sisters, from this Scripture, we know that's wrong because all the people who are in front of the Lord Jesus Christ; who believe in Jesus Christ; who do His Will, God will give them His glorious inheritance, not only in eternal time but also in the present age. When I read the Bible I found one message in Mark 10, once Peter said to the Lord Jesus Christ: we have left everything to follow you."" that means: what are you going to give to me back? Then Jesus replied: I tell you the truth, no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life. ""(Mark 10:28-30)This is what Jesus told us, anyone who works for Jesus; who does God's will, God will give him a hundred time as much he has left and also eternal life, that means our Lord Jesus Christ not only take care of our eternal life, but also take care of our present life on the earth.Third: Loads incomparable great power Through verses 19-23, it is talking about Gods incomparable great power.  Sometimes when we face the difficulties we feel so weak. I share with you that sometimes when I was facing people who were encountering trouble or trial, I didnt know how I could help them.This morning, there was a mom coming to the pastors office. She shared about her burden. She was crying. She has a son who is just 30 years old. Last year they found that he had leukemia. Hes in the hospital near here. It has costed all they have, but still seems hopeless and could not stop the disease. When I was facing the crying mom, I felt I was so weak.   Brothers and sisters, you may have the same experience. Today, we read the Scripture that God Lord Jesus Christ told us through the Bible that the Almighty God has incomparable power. Verses 19  23 are talking about this incomparable power.  The explanation about the power:This incomparable great power is working in Jesus Christ. So Jesus Christ can rise from dead.  This is resurrection from dead. (1:20a) This incomparable power can raise people from dead.Exaltation to Gods right hand and above every ruler or force: not only Lord rose from dead, but also our Lord Jesus Christ exalted Him to our Fathers right hand and above every ruler and force.Scripture proof of the submission of al things to Christ (1:22a) All things be under the force of Jesus Christ.Christ as head of all things for the church--His body (1:22b-23a)The fullness filling all things (1:23b)This part of the Scripture explains what the incomparable power looks like. This is far beyond what we can imagine. If our eyes can be opened by the Holy Spirit, we will know the eternal hope and the inheritance in Lord Jesus Christ. Well experience and know the power of Lord Jesus Christ. This power is incomparable power.When I read this, I was very excited, but I was still confused. Sometimes the Bible seems to us is just knowledge. I know God is power, the Almighty God. But how about my situation? How can I experience this power in my own life? What I need is that my Lord Jesus Christ can help me. Maybe this is also your question? When I prepared this sermon, I did pray a lot. I dont know how I can explain it so that people not only know, but also experience the inheritance and the incomparable power. So here I have some suggestions and maybe you have more. How can this apply in our daily life? How can our eyes be opened? From the Scripture, we know that opening eyes is not what we can do, but what the Holy Spirit can do. Paul said that I ask our Lord Jesus Christ the glorious Father may give you spirit of wisdom and the revelation. And I also pray that the eyes of your hearts may be enlightened. From this part of Scripture, we know that we cannot open our eyes when we are in the darkness. But the Lord Jesus Christ can. Today I pray for all of us that our Heavenly Father will give us wisdom and revelation. I pray to our Lord Jesus Christ, Trinity God will open your eyes, and enlighten the eyes of your heart. So the first thing I want to share with you is the Trinity God will continuously work in our hearts.Second, what should I do in my daily life to relate the truth to our life? Most of our brothers and sisters know the power of our God and seem to understand God is powerful and merciful, but sometimes they do not relate that to their daily life. I did the same thing too. Recently I feel very weak because there are lots of things going on in the church and also in my daily life and there are many decisions I need to make  and many things I need to worry about, not only for my own things, but also many brothers and sisters always sharing with me the bad news. So if you have good news, please do share with me too. So I feel so frustrated and one night, I read a spiritual book talking about the Lord Jesus as the way. I thought to myself, oh, I know that. I can memorize these words even when I was very young. I know Lord is the way and truth and light. But when I continued reading, I found that it guided me to realize that I was wrong. Even though I knew this, I did not take these words personally; I did not relate Gods truth to my own life because in some situations, it seemed to me I had no way. In the end, I found out in this book that Load Jesus is the way. Lord Jesus is my way. When I found out this, I realized that I was wrong even though I knew these words. But when I was in trouble, I still worried about tomorrow; I did not regard Jesus Christ as my way. That night I repeated these words in my heart and I read them again and again: Jesus Christ is the way and Lord Jesus is my way. I dont need to worry about tomorrow. I dont need the map of the way because Jesus is my way. What I need to do is just to follow Him.Confess our doubts to God frankly. When you cannot see the hope or the power of God, a wise way is to pray to God frankly and confess your doubt directly to God. There is another story about myself. Today I will show my weakness to all of you and you will know who I am. Before I went to the seminary, I had one thing to worry about, do you know what? Money! If I quitted my job, I would have no salary. But I needed money to study in the seminary. So giving up my job meant that I had to give my whole life to Jesus. Who would provide me money then? I really worried about this and I was also very proud. I didnt want to ask money from others like from donation because I didnt want to be a poor guy if I became a servant of God. Thats why I prayed to God like this: Lord Jesus Christ I know you are Almighty God; I know you can heal people. I know you can do miracles in different ways, but one thing I cannot believe is the money. I dont want you to give me money through others hands. What I want is for you to give me money directly. But I know this is impossible! You cannot give me money from Heaven and say to me, hi Jessica here is the money. You cannot give me a credit card directly with my name on it. After this prayer, do you know what happened? At that time I was a teacher in a junior high school. I rode my bike to the school to work but I had already gotten the letter from the seminary, saying that they accepted me but I needed to pay the tuition, about 2,000 RMB. Perhaps it is not a big deal for you but, for me at that time, its a lot. On the way to the school, theres a song singing in my heart, maybe most of you know this song: I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland. This is a song I could sing when I was very young. At that moment I questioned God: What? You can make a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland? But why I dont have money? Why I dont get money from your hand directly? Do you know what happened when I arrived the school? Maybe you have many different answers, but I will tell you soon. After I got to school, I got a letter from Nanjing Union Theological Seminary and it was a one-hundred percent tuition scholarship. I didnt ask for that, but I was lucky and blessed. And also it proved that I was wrong, because I thought God couldnt give me money directly, but He did. So dear brothers and sisters, if you want to know more, maybe I will share with you after the service, because time is limited. From this story of my own experience, I want to tell you that when you have doubt about God, you have to come to Him, and confess your sins. For example, if you worry about money, you shouldnt say that God, give me money directly; you should say that God, please forgive me, I confess that I thought you are not able to provide what I need. So dear brothers and sisters, the third is to practice in your daily life. When you trust in Jesus Christ, you know every Word which God speaks to you in the Bible just for you. Like today we read the words about the hope of His calling, the riches of the glorious inheritance, and the incomparable powerThese words are  not just for me, not just for Paul, and not just for any other people. There words are   just for you yourself today who hear these  and who read these. Our Lord wants you to follow Him one day at a time. Our Lord wants to go with you through every trial and trouble. If you do trust in Him, if you do follow Him one day at a time, you will experience that, and your eyes will be opened, and your faith will be built stronger and stronger. I will invite Sophia to share her experience. Thank you, Jessica, for the opportunity to share my story. Days ago, Jessica and I were studying material together and in the material. It talks about following Jesus one day at a time. I started to worry about a lot of things altogether and worry about future. When we studied that I got so excited; Yes I experienced that and it works perfectly, really my eyes were opened because I could see Hes will better for me, and I could see how He directed me through each difficulty I had. So Jessica asked me why you didnt share the story with the congregation. I was like: OK, I would be nervous to tell it to everyone but OK, I appreciate the opportunity, so here I am. And hopefully the story would be helpful to you. During my last semester at my Business School in American, I was overwhelmed by all kinds of work I had to do. I was the editor-in-chief at the school newspaper, two editors in my team had problems and they were going to quit the team and caused troubles to the students newspaper. I was facing the pressure revolving the issue, but the same time the school, was pushing me to launch a very brand new online publication soon. And since it was my last term at school, I had all these important projects that in hand, I had to finish them on time, all the deadlines were approaching.And besides all these projects, I had very important exams waiting for me, which were coming soon. So I was like that I was not able to do this, God, I cant do this, but I know you are all powerful God, I know you can do a lot of things, but can you magically make all these work disappear? I dont think He could make all these work disappear, Im still the person who should finish it, who should do it, who should put effort to it. So I got so frustrated, I didnt know how I could get through my last term at school.But one day God revealed to me, He said Sophia, why do you get so frustrated and so overwhelmed, why do you worry about all this stuff altogether? Your deadlines are not on the same day, your deadlines are not today, you have all the time to do it, you just have to take a step at a time, you just follow me one step at a time, and I will show you what to do today. And He just wants to focus on whats happening today and do it faithfully for Him. And I was like: Yes, that is right, my deadlines are not today, and why I am worried about it now? Why I am worried about all this stuff at one time? So then I confessed to God: Yes its OK, I would like to divide all my work into different days, and just to deal with one portion of that day at that time. I dont have to worry about tomorrow; I dont have to worry about the day after tomorrow. I dont have to worry when the deadline come. I just have to focus on the portion of that day and to do my best on that day. So after that every day I woke up, the first thing I did was to get to know that OK, this is the thing you want to do, OK, now show me how to do it? Show me your will on it, show me how are you going to get me through that? And my eyes were really opened; you know how He just directed me step by step, how He taught me to do each of the things; different situations to overcome all the difficulties, and I was like, yes that was true, that was how God led me to through that. It was not I do it, my eyes were no longer blind by that time. So when the next day came, I told myself: well, you dont have to worry about whats happening yesterday, dont have to worry about whether you have done a good job yesterday, because you have already given that to the Lord. And you dont have to worry about what is going to happen tomorrow, because thats in Gods hands. You just focus on today, to see what God wants you to do today and do it faithfully for Him. So then, its really amazing that God worked through all the difficulties, and taught me step by step. You know whats the result? Whats happening in the end? Its really amazing that the issue at my editorial team was successfully resolved and the new online publication was successfully launched on time, and won a lot of praises from my fellow classmates. And also before I thought I could not do well on my projects because of all these stress I had, but then in the end, surprisingly, I got straight As and graduated as one of the very top students at my school. I was like that was totally Gods glory there; that was totally how He got me through that. By following Him step by step one day at a time, He told me how to do it. You know that all this pressure got me very overwhelmed, too much ahead I had just to worry about things altogether. I did it just by following Jesus step by step one day at a time. So that is the practical thing for you to do. Do not worry about tomorrow, because when you do that, you blind your eyes, you just get overwhelmed and so stressed, you cant see Gods will for you today. You dont know what you are going to do today and how His power will get through that. But if you just focus on today, and pray after His will, take His will for you today, youll see the amazing results; youll see His hand leading you. You are not on your own, and get everything through peacefully and joyfully. And thats the amazing thing for you to take. So I hope this story can encourage you in your daily life if you just give it to God and follow Him one day at a time. Thank you for the opportunity to share, so now let Jessica come back to the stage just for the rest of the sermon. Dear brothers and sisters, God is God of all blessing, our Lord Jesus Christ, not only loves me and  Sophia, but also you. Jesus Christ comes to save you, and He wants to build an intimate relationship with you. So dear brothers and sisters, today I want to invite all of you to stand and pray. According to todays sermon, you can give your worry and fear and things you have concerns to God.Maybe you should confess your sins, to say that God this is my worry, why I am worried about that, because I dont believe and dont trust that you can work in these and through these. God is powerful God, and He has incomparable power, and God is the God who is going to give us eternal hope. So dear brothers and sisters, I will invite you and take this time maybe one minute to pray for yourself. Dear Lord, thank you so much today for your giving us wisdom and revolution, and for your opening our eyes so that we can see. Lord, Jesus Christ, today I myself come in front of you, I want to confess my sins., While dealing with the difficult situation, I dont have faith, I dont trust in you, I dont think you can deal with that. Lord, Jesus Christ, today I come in front of you; I want to confess that when I hear the bad news from brothers and sisters, I dont know how I can help them. I dont know how can I help them experience your power, I even dont think you can help them. Lord, please forgive my doubts. Lord, today I will pray that open my eyes and open the eyes of my brothers and sisters hearts, reveal to us who God is, teach us how we can follow you. Let us experience your incomparable power so we will show your glory to this world, we will live as your children of Light. We pray in Jesus name.  PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 8"

Youll be friend to the lonely, travel with those who are desperate, and comfort those who mourn. We have no need that you cannot meet, you lift us when we are depressed, and your power humbles us when we are proud. Your courage strengthens us when we are afraid, and your peace comes to us when we are in paddle. We thank you for your love, and we pray for great capacity to love. We thank for the beauty of the Spring, and we pray that you will bless your church today, as it continues to struggle to make the ancient truth relevant to the new times and the new problems. As we are preparing our heart for the Easter, please strengthen us and teach us through all kinds of ways. We pray for those who are sick and in need, and pray for everybody who has come to your church today. We pray for the worship service today, pray for the pastors, and also the worship team. Pray for those who are coming here for the first time. May you open their hearts, so that they may hear your word, and know your love. With all the praise we owe you. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.Pastor WuGreetings to you, my brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ. Every time when we are singing Amazing Grace, ""Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. Whenever I sing this song, I think of the second chapter of Ephesians 2:1-10, especially verses 1-7. Let me read verses 1-7: But because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions--it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages, He might show the incomparable riches of His grace, expressed in His kindness to us in Christ Jesus. When I was reading verse 7 of the second chapter of Ephesians, there was a picture in my mind; a picture in which God is speaking to me, God is showing His passion and love to me. Brothers and sisters, you know, in less than two weeks, we are going to enter into the Passion Week of 2012. It is the time when we celebrate Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, the only begotten Son of God who was sent to this world to save people who have trust in Him. So whenever I was reading this passage, the picture that our Heavenly Father is showing His love and passion to us shows up in my mind. Today we just had a wonderful and very passionate worship; because two worship leaders, who also have the passion for the Lord, are with us, leading the worship. They are from a church in Oregon, and they are Baka and Ryan, would you please stand up, let us give them a hand, please be seated. They are here to show their passion to the Lord, and also show their passion for the congregation of Haidian Church. Last year from September to December, three pastors from Haidian Church went to their church to be trained to be a good servant of the Lord, and they did a good job there. Brothers and sisters, taking care of a person for a few days is a great responsibility, but taking care of three pastors for three months, that's a tremendous job, that's tremendous work. It requires passion for the Lord, it requires passion for Jesus and also for people who trust in Jesus Christ. And that church again today shows their passions for the congregation, and the senior pastor of this church Randy is here. I'm going to invite him to preach today, let's give him a hand. Pastor RandyGood morning. I'm very, very happy to be here with you today, because we have a lot of friendship with people in this congregation: Pastor Wu and Rachel and Gloria, and now with other new friends weve met here today. We love this country, we love you, and we love this church. We pray for you often and you are in our hearts, and it is fun for me to come and get to see you face to face. I love the passage of Scripture we read this morning: Ephesians 2. Ephesians 2 is a great statement about what it means to be a Christian, what is life in God really about. The apostle Paul wrote this letter while he was sitting in the prison in Roman. Because of his faith in Jesus Christ, he was put in jail and he wrote letters to Christians around the world, to encourage them in their faith in God and to remind them that everything they have as believers in Jesus Christ, and today those words that he wrote are still encouraging us. And they bring out of our heart thankfulness, and they bring out our heart awe in worship, because of the goodness, love, mercy and kindness of God towards us. And he showed to us in sending His Son Jesus, and there are three places that we understand what God has done for us in this passage of Scripture, there are three snapshots we want to look at, three pictures we can see this morning.The first has to do with who we used to be. What is life like without God? When we don't have God in our heart, we don't have God's love in our life, what is that person like? But what happens when God comes to that kind of person? And how does God come to that kind of person? And when He does, what happens in that person's life? And who do they become? And so there are three pictures: who I used to be? Then what God did for me? And who I am now in God because of Jesus love for me? My wife was putting together a photo album recently of pictures that we have taken over the course of our 23 years of marriage, and we have three sons: Joseph, Samuel and Thomas, so we have taken a lot of pictures. We were putting those pictures on the computer and we were making a photo collection of them, and my wife showed me a picture from when we got married 23 years ago. How many of you have seen a picture recently of what you used to look like a long time ago? Anybody? I looked at that picture of me from 23 years ago and I said: who is that guy? Hes so skinny. Look at him, he does not have any gray hair, he does not have any tired wrinkles under his eyes, who is that guy, thats who I used to be. I used to be single, now I am married; I used to be skinner, now I am, not so skinny; I used to be younger and now I am older than I was then. I have changed. I run into a friend recently who I havent seen for a long time, and there was something that is so different from how I used to know him to be. I knew him when we went to high school together. He was mean, he was a nasty, mean guy, and he was always picking on me because my faith in Jesus Christ in high school. But there was something different about him and when I saw him, I immediately began to have the feelings that I did from long time ago when we were in high school together. But as I talked to him, I could tell that he had changed, I could tell that there was something different about him, and I asked him this question and I said: Todd, are you a believer in Jesus Christ? And he said: Yes, how did you know? And I said because you are different. This is the way he said to me: Im not that same person anymore. Jesus has come into my heart and hes changing my life."" And I said: I know, I can tell by the way youre even talking to me, I can tell by the way you treat people, by the way you treated me like a jerk when we were in high school. But I just get that in the record. But if you look at verses 1 to 3, this is not a pretty picture of what life is without God. And some people think that God has just come so that he could make bad people good, but thats not what Christianity is about. Christianity is not how we can make jerks like Todd into nice people. That is not what Christianity is about. Its one of the effects and one of the out-working that Jesus works in our hearts to change a person. Jesus came to make dead people alive. Jesus came to people who were spiritually without life. We were cut off. The  Scripture says we were without hope in this world; we had nothing that we could look to as a future of eternal life apart from God.The picture that is painted in Verse 1 to 3 says: This is what you were like. You were dead in your transgressions and sins; you used to live like this when you followed the ways of this world and of the rule of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. We also live among them one time and we did what our sinful nature wanted to do, we glorify the cravings of our flash. We followed its desires and thoughts. And this is what we were by our very nature. We were deserving of wrath. We were doing what came naturally to us; we were without God and we were acting like a life without God can only act like. This is how I used to be; this was my future to be cut off to be separated, to be eternally removed from God. It is not a pretty picture. But this is what we see in Chapter 2 verse 4, it says: But because of His great love for us. This is the difference. When I looked at me before God came into my life to change me, I would not want God to love me, but God loved me when I was like that, I said a minute ago that I have three sons, when they were little, we went on a trip. We came to the airport in our hometown and as we came to the terminal to the came up with the  we all came off, we had to walk down this hallway and downstairs to get on the subway, that will take us to the main terminal where we will get our luggage and baggage. We had all of the stuff you carry when you travel with little kids, big tubs of food, crackers and toys, blanket and all of the diapers and all those things that you have to carry.When we were coming down the steps and there were so many people coming down those steps, and as we got to the bottom of the steps, I could tell that the train was filled with people that we would have to wait for the next one. As we got to the bottom of the steps and I turned to tell my wife we needed to wait for next train, and just when I said that, my three-year-old son Sam ran and jumped onto the subway, and I turned around and I saw him as he turned around and looked at me, the doors closed and off he went. I looked at my wife and said:  I am sure glad that weve got two other kids because I am going to  miss him. You know what happened? In my heart, everything became very clear as to what my life was about. In that moment, only one thing mattered, the only thing that mattered was that my son was lost and I wanted him to be with me. My three-year-old son could not read, he didnt know oh I should get off the next station and wait for my parents to catch up to me. He was vulnerable, he was at risk, it was dangerous and this fathers heart had one goal and one purpose, thats to find my son! I would have to go to him because he couldnt come to me. When mankind sinned, it separated us from the love of God; it separated us from the presence of God. God made us for Himself and when we disobeyed and sinned, it separated us, we are blind, we dont know how to get to Him. We cant see. We have no spiritual life. But God does not stop loving us. So God said, I will come to them. And he clothed Himself in humanity. And he was born of a virgin. And he grew up and lived on this earth for 33 years. He was without sin. He went to the cross. He laid down his life, for the punishment of our sins. The death that we deserved. And Jesus paid that, so that we could be brought back into a relationship with our God, who loves us and who never stops loving us.When you look at words like these, this is how we used to be, but God, shall we say those words together again, did something. Its not what something that we do, but God does, but God loves us, God in his rich mercy shows us His kindness. God came to people like us, who were lost and who were separated from God. When something is lost, you look for it. That is a statement of value. It means that which is lost is precious to you. I lost a watch recently in my house. I looked for that watch for about 5 minutes. You know why I looked for that watch for only about 5 minutes? I stopped looking for it. That watch was about 15 years old. It did not even work about half the time. So, I figured. Good. Its gone. I can get a new watch. If that watch had memory, if it was a gift, if it was special to me, I would still be looking for it right now. I would not quit until I found it. And God comes to people like you and me all over this world in every generation. And He brings this to Himself. He helps us see the truth of who He really is. And what He could be in our life. He wants to do in our life because of His great love for us, God who is rich in mercy, made us alive in Christ. What did God make us alive? Because we were dead. We had no spiritual life. And he came to our life by bringing us into his life. And the life that we had been alive is the life of God when we put our faith and our trust in the person of Jesus Christ.If you look at verse 7, it says that in the coming ages, he might show the incomparable riches of his grace. Grace is something God does for us, to provide for the need of our life that we cant do for ourselves, and expressed in his kindness to us , in Christ Jesus.  God has been kind to us.Verse 8. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.Verse 9. And it is not by works, so that no one can boast. What is that saying is that God loves us, wants us to be alive, not dead, God wants to give us a gift. By faith, we receive it. And we cant earn it. There is nobody who is good enough to earn what God gives us freely by grace, if we receive it by faith.I dont know if this morning you have a difficult time believing God loves you or not, because this is what it is like in my country, where I am from. People feel like they have to deserve Gods love. God must love me because I dont know what it is like for you.  What if you would fill in that blank.. God loves me because I am a good person. God loves me because I am so handsome. God loves me because I got a great sense of fashion. What are the ridiculous things people could think about why would God love me because I am kind to the hurting, because I share with the poor, Does God love me because of those things?.How many of you in this room are married? Would you raise your hands? How many of you who are not married think that someday you might be married? Would you raise your hands? You guys are looking at each other. You never know. May be you would swap cards, phone numbers or something. You never know.  No, you did not come to the church to do that.So, let me give some advice to married people for a moment, and to those who might be married one day. Sometimes, your spouse Let just say for me. If my wife would say, honey, do you love me? And I would say, yes, I love you. And she might say, why do you love me? If I say, it is because you are pretty, because you are so smart, because you are so talented, If I say to her I love her because of these things, she may think that her value, and what secures my love for her, is based on those things. What if those things would change? She might be insecure about my love for her. Listen, in Jesus Christ, this is what God says, I love you. And we might say, God, why do you love me? You know what God says. I love you just because I love you. That is what God says. Not because you earned it. Not because you are so doctrinally sound, so spiritual and good. He loves you just because he loves you. Its that love we respond to in Jesus Christ that began good work in us. It brings us into the life of God that began to change us. Its what God did for me, because I could not do it myself.One night I was praying next to my kids. Every so often, I would go into my kids bedrooms and knelt beside the beds while they were sleeping and pray.. When they were younger, I did this a lot.  I was praying next to one of my sons. His name was Sam. The little one who ran onto to the train. He is the one giving me the biggest challenge. And he is not here, so I can say that about him. And dont tell him. But I was praying that  he had a rough day.. He did not behave the best. He is my son. That is not going to change how I love my son. I wanted the best for him. I was praying for him. I began to feel in my heart that this love for my son was strong in my heart that it hurt. Have you ever love somebody so strong like a pain in your chest? I began to have this thought that I cant imagine anybody would love me as much as I love my son right now? The minute I had that thought, its like God whispers into my heart and says, I love you more. Something changed my heart that night. I stopped striving. I stopped trying to work so hard to prove something to God.I began to understand that I am a child of God and it freezes me to serve God with all of my heart and with joy, not as a means to obtain His love, but because I am loved. If you look in verse 10, we see how that love transformed us, because this is who I used to be, but God did something, which made it  possible for me to be somebody else. Verse 10 says, For we are Gods handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. Ephesians 2:10 NIV.  God wants us to do good things. Through our life, He wants us to do good. Not so we earn His love, but because we are loved. This is what He says, you are God's workmanship. Wow, I am big. Look how big I am that we are God's workmanship. If you were studying that word in the Bible That word is translated out of the word in the originally written in the Greek language and it is the word for poem. Have anybody heard the word  poem? It is a word from which we get poetry and poem from. And when you look at this verse and it says for we are Gods workmanship. We are Gods poem. We are Gods  masterpiece. God puts a lot of creativity. God puts a lot of thoughtfulness into shaping and forming our life so that we could be who He made us to be. So that we could do what He made us to do . All for His glory and all for our fulfillment and joy in Him. The motivation is different. I am not trying to earn and prove that I worth something, but I am secure in Gods love and now can do and be who He made me to be and do what He calls me to do, because before the world even began, God purposed something in this world that you would do that in your city, in your nation, in your world, that your family your neighborhood. That is something in His good purpose of plan for you to do. I finishwith this story. A year ago, I was in the nation of Israel to go on a tour. In Israel, so many of the locations we read about in the Bible and it just made the Bible came alive. We had a group of people from our church who went on this tour .On  the last day,you stand upon this mountain, which called the mountain of Olives. Probably you would be reading about it in the next two weeks when you go on to the passion week. It is where Jesus rode the donkey down the mountain in the valley into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday that we celebrate this Palm Sunday and when we standing upon there looking down the mountain into the city of Jerusalem. I was just waiting for people who were taking pictures and visiting. There was a young boy standing right next to me and I looked up to him and I said what is your name? And he says my name is Wassin. I said: Wassin, how old are you? He said I am eleven years old and I said really? Do you go to school? And he said yeah and he pointed down to the valley and he said I go to school down there and that where I live and I said look great and then he said to me with a big smile on his face and he said in three days is my birthday! And I am going to be twelve years old. I said: Wassin, No way! I have a son named Thomas. He is eleven years old and in three days, he is going to turn twelve. I am going home late tonight to get on the airplane and I am going home for his birthday! And he got a big smile on his face and he said maybe someday you could meet my son Thomas and you could become friends. And he got big smile so then I reached into my pocket and I pull out some money that I had, Shekels. It is really Shekels. It is their money and I like a hundred Shekels or something I do not know the rate of exchange would be for them but it was a lot. I said: Wassin, can I give you this? I want you to go buy yourself a trip for your birthday. On your birthday, you go buy yourself a trip. Will you do that? And he got a big smile on his face he took the Shekels and he went bang, and he run away. And I went up, it was fun and I looked around and all of  a sudden, I see Wassin talk to this man over there and they was talking and also they pointed me. He was holding the money, and I went uh, did I do something wrong? Was that a cultural no no. Now here comes at this man. He was coming over with Wassin and he said, you gave my son Shekels. And I said, yeah, I did for his birthday. He said I was Wassin father and he reached into his pocket and he pull out this a little coin that in the Bible  it is called widows light. In the day of Jesus, it was of the least value, but Jesus talk something about generosity of the little lady who gave a widow mind. Jesus said, look at her. She gave more than anybody else, because she gave everything that she had. So one of the things I wanted to do in Israel was to get a widows mind as a souvenir to remind me about that story, but I had not got that yet. And he said I own a coin shop, an antique shot down in the valley, and I want to give you this coin as widows mind. And I said oh, I cannot accept that, you do not have to do that, because it is worth seventy and eighty American dollars. I said no no, I cannot do that. And he says no, and he put it in my hand and he wraps my finger around it and he looks at me and said, you honor my son, so I honor you. And do you know what salvation is? Salvation is God says you accept Jesus and God accepts you in Jesus. You want all of the Father has is given through receiving the son. And I want you to bow your head with me. I want to pray and I want to ask God to send his holy spirit to help us understand the truth and the life and the way he has made for us in sending his son. Because I know who I used to be, as the apostle Paul says, he was dead in his trespasses and sins, he was not free the way he was by all kinds of passions of desires. But God who is rich and mercy who loved you and loved me and showed us His grace and kindness through His son. It is nothing but we can earn, but is His free gift for those who put their faith and trust in Him and because of that we are now his workmanship. We are His handiwork. We are loved by God. We have been set free and saved by God who has forgiven our sins and given his life. He has made our life in Christ and now we can do good works that He has   prepared for us to do. Good works in consistence with the way He made you, but He made you  foremost to love Him and to know Him. That is where life begins. This morning I just want to invite you if you want to know Gods love. If you want to know the freedom from fear, the forgiveness of sin that the life has created by God. Jesus is a spiritual miracle, because we do not have that capability and potential by ourselves. So God came to us and gave to us and just where you see and you can say Jesus I trust you. Jesus I open my heart to you. Jesus I turned from my sin, I turned from a life apart of you just as I am. Thank you for your grace. Thank you for your mercy. Thank you for your love. Thank you for your salvation. Thank you that your are so passion of pursuing come to me, when I am not come to you and thank you for making us to do good works to bring about and show faith about your kingdom and glory. In Jesus name. Amen.  PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 1"

The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.4 When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.Pastor Wu:Jesus, all for Jesus. All I am, and have, and ever hope to be, all for Jesus. What a powerful song; what a powerful spiritual formation that we have this morning. I believe the worship team and the worship service for this morning really brought us to the spiritual banquet, in which we not only enjoy our time but also our relationship with Jesus Christ, and our Heavenly Father. So I would like to take this opportunity to give thanks to the Spirit, and also give my heart-felt thanks to our worship leaders. They are very special, and they are very committed Christians.Explanation of Palm SundayBrothers and sisters, today is the Palm Sunday of 2012. On this day, a bit less than 2 000 years ago, Jesus was entering the Holy City  Jerusalem. Before He entered that city, He knew what was going to happen to Him; and before that, He shared what was going to happen to Him to His disciples, Peter and the rest of the team. He was saying that He was going to be crucified on the cross, and He was going to die, and in three days, He would come back to life. One of His disciples, Peter, came to Him, Wow, no, Lord, you are not supposed to do that. We are not going to let that happen to you. And Jesus said to Peter, Demon, come to my behind! Jesus knew what was going to happen to Him, but He did not hesitate to face the death, to enter Jerusalem, and to be crucified on the cross. He did not hesitate to come into our world that was hostile to the gospel, hostile to the teaching of the Lord, and hostile to our Heavenly Father. He did not hesitate to do that. He just walked in; actually, He entered Jerusalem on a humble donkey. Stephen Marburys WitnessBrothers and sisters, I am personally a big fan of basketball. I love basketball even though I am short (see I am short). But still, it does not matter if you are short or tall so long if you enjoy the game. I enjoy it very much. Last Friday, I had a wonderful time! Last Friday, I had a very good time! Beijing basketball team won the national championship! I was so happy that I came to tear. A man in front of his wife, my wife was surfing on the internet, was crying in front of the TV. And I was touched not only by the result, that result that I have been expecting and praying for so many years, but also by a man who did a wonderful thing. And what he was doing really touched my heart, my spirit. And the man is Stephen Marbury. When 18 000 people stood up, crying out, We are the champion! this man collapsed onto the floor. He did not stand up, he collapsed. He was on his hips, he was not on his knees, but he collapsed on the floor with two hands in front of his face, praising and praying, giving praises to the Lord. Later he was interviewed by media, and a media reporter asked him, How could you have come this far? What is the response he had for this question? I thank God! I thank God! When 18 000 people did not know the Lord, standing and saying, We are the champion! This man was on the floor, praising the Lord, saying, I thank God in a hostile world towards Christianity. And this story reminds me of my trip last February to one of the Christian universities in Ohio. The university is located in the middle of the state, a nice and quiet environment. And this school requires of all the students, one hour everyday of the study to go to the chapel to worship together. All the faculties and students worship together. Because one of the primary intention and purpose of this school, a key foundation of this school is to bring these young kids up in a Christian college within a more and more secularized world, a country that is getting more and more hostile and secularized, this kind of environment. And I was so blessed by the dean, and my relationship with that university. And I have been trying to persuade my daughter to transfer from the university she goes to now to that college, but that might take some time to do because the new situation is challenging, that is something you have to conquer. Today, we are so blessed that the president of that college, that university is with us. The president who insists that a Christian college, who brings up young kids based on our Christian teaching, Jesus teaching, in the future could contribute to the healthy growth of this world. And that president is here.Guest Speaker:Thank you, Pastor Wu, my brother and my friend. Its wonderful to be here with family. Christians all over the world and throughout the history are family. Weve got this where we come from. Thank you for your nice words about Cillaville College. The reality is of course that as Christians, regardless of what we do in life, we are called to be follower of Christ, and how we live, how we think, and how we treat the people around us. Because how we live tells the world that there is something more to life than merely making money and having fame. Stephen Marbury showed that. He was key to that victory, and yet he felled down to give thanks to God. Great testimony, dont you think? And thats for all of us; because people may not understand what we believe always. They may question what we believe. But when they see a life lived that honours Christ, then they will want to know what it is that you believe. His TestimonyI have a degree in mathematics from university; my dream was to go into outer space, to be an astronaut. But I came to know Christ during that period of time. It was difficult for me because I had to decide science or God. In my mind, you could not have both; it was one or the other. Then I began to realise after I heard about Jesus Christ, the God who created the world also created science. And there are the greatest scientists throughout history even today who are followers of God, they know Jesus Christ. So when I heard that Jesus came and died for me, just as we are saying, I gave my life to Him. I did not know where my future was going to lead, but I knew that I was going to walk with Him.In the passage that we looked at just a moment ago in Nehemiah chapter one, its an great example that what it means to be a Christian in a unchristian world, a follower of God in a world that can be antagonistic to God. It didnt bother Stephen Marbury when eighteen thousand people cheering, because in his mind, he wanted them, in one way or another that, to know he gave thanks to God. The Background of NehemiahNehemiah was a man who knew God, and he lived in cultural that was antagonistic to God. He was the cupbearer to the king. The cupbearer didnt mean that he was just a food taster, but rather nothing got to the king Artaxerxes unless it got to Nehemiah first. He was a man of profound power and authority, of great respect and trust. He was a man of excellence, that is why he had such a prominent position. He was not a prophet, not a priest, not a pastor. In fact you might say that he was not even a politician. But he was a man of God. When you read the book of Nehemiah, you are actually reading the last book of the Old Testament, at least historically. Because the prophet Malachi actually delivered the prophecy during the time that Nehemiah was in Jerusalem. As we read through the text we realized Nehemiah was serving the king in Susa which was the winter palace. It was November and December; it was twentieth year of Artaxerxes reign, which made 445 BC.The Heart of God: Nehemiahs First ConcernOne of his brothers, Hanani, had returned from Jerusalem, which was eight hundred miles to the west of Susa, through a long and treacherous journey. Nehemiah asked him about two things. He was concerned about two things. he said, How are the people in Jerusalem? How is the city of Jerusalem? Now why would Nehemiah be concerned about these two things? Because God was concerned about these two things. As you read the Old Testament, you find that God has chosen for Himself a people, through whom He would bring the Word of God, the written Word of God and the incarnated Word of God  Jesus Christ. The whole focal point of Gods blessings and promises were these people. That is what the heart of God is beating, and that is what Nehemiahs heart is beating as well. The Heart of God: Nehemiahs Second ConcernAnd the second thing he asked about was the city itself, how is the city? Why was he concerned about the city Jerusalem? Because God was concerned about Jerusalem, the only place in the world where the law of God could be fulfilled. And if that was what Gods concern was, that was Nehemiahs concern as well. Nehemiah has heart and mind for God; Nehemiah has a concern for the things of God. Just reading this is a challenge, because for you and for me, we must ask the question, What is that our heart concerns? What God is concerned about, is that the same thing that I am concerned about? You must realise that Ezra has been living in Israel for twelve years; you also must realise that a hundred years before, Jerusalem had been destroyed, the temple had been destroyed; and all the dreams and hopes of Gods people were rubble. And when the Persians conquered the Babylonians, they allowed the Jews to begin to return to Israel, but there was nothing there. Ezra came, and they rebuilt the temple. Worship could be restored, but it was still very sad because Jerusalem itself was rubble; no one could live there. Ezra preached and read the Word of God, but to no effective was that as the Israelites came back, they began to realise that the hopes and dreams they had as Gods people were still rubble; the rubbles of those walls and the gates, which symbolized the rubble of their own faith. For the very first time, because what they have heard frightened them right. May God give us the courage, that strength to live what it is we believe. Amen.Lets pray,Father, thank you for your good work to us. Thank you for the example of Nehemiah for all of us, for you. Give us minds that think with yours, eyes to see what you see and heart that breaks with yours that we may be made one in God. And the people who want to come before you because of what they see in us, not because they are perfect, only because we love as you have loved us. In Jesus precious name we pray, amen.Pastor WuWhat a powerful message Doctor Brown has given us. It tells us how we, as Christians, live in a no-Christian world, even though it challenges us with many difficulties, so long we have heart of God, and we will be the champion. Thank you Doctor Brown, for many blessings this morning. I will try my best to persuade my daughter to transfer to your college. Lets say what might happen. And my wife was, actually this morning, working on that. Another Personal TestimonyAnd again, this morning we are very much blessed to have another special guest, who is going to sing in a very special way, a style, Mongolian minority singing style, a Christian song. About two years ago, he came to Haidian Church for the first time because of his girlfriend. His girlfriends father was struggling with cancer. So the girl was very sad, and she urged her boyfriend to come to church to pray together. So he was kind of very hesitant. Anyway, he came to the church, he was not sure if God was real or God existed. But at the end of the service, before he left church, he said to God, God, if you are real, I have a sister whom I have not seen, or spoken a single word with for three years because three years ago she was fighting with our father, and she left home. For three years, I did not know where she was; I did not know what she was doing; I did not know if she was still alive or dead. If you are real, please Lord, help her to contact me in whatever ways. The following morning, he was contacted by his sister, whom he had not been communicating for three years. Based on that testimony, he wrote a song, Great Love, based on 1 Corinthians, chapter 13, The Lord is love, and love is the Lord. So he is going to sing that Great Love now.

"32","20120408eng","2012-04-08","Pastor Wu","He is Risen","Matthew 28:1-10","Apr. 08 2012Christ is risen!Dr. Rick Mauw:It is so good to be with you this morning on this great day in the history of the Christian year, the day in which we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ then. We are honored to be with you this morning, especially on this very special day. We come not as tourists or as church visitors, but we come as members of the same family. Because Jesus Christ is risen from the dead. Through his blood on the cross of Calvary, he is putting together a new family. From every tribe and tongue and people and nation. And this is a great family celebration of the Christian year. We come to you as brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ. But we also come in response to an invitation, because we hear that same invitation today that the women heard from the angels when they came to the empty tomb, and that is ""come and see"" the place where he was laid. We come to church today to come and see the empty tomb, but also to share with those women the experience of encountering the risen Christ. You know it is very important that it was women who first encountered the risen Christ. You don't understand why that is important. We have to realize that women did not have an easy time in the ancient world, in this region where the resurrection took place. For many centuries the life of Israel was characterized by what we call patriarchy, a patriarchal structure. And in a patriarchy, which literally meant the rule of the adult male, only men were able to hold power. In fact only men were allowed to give evidence in the court of law. We have to realize this from the Old Testament already, where it says that God is a God who take seriously the cause of the widow and the orphan. We will remind of that again in the New Testament, the Apostle James says that to honor the widow and the orphan is true religion. Why there are strong emphases in the Bible alone on the importance in God's eyes of the widow and the orphan? Because widows and orphans were especially powerless in that ancient world. Because unless they had a man to defend them, unless they had a man to speak up on their behalf, they really had no status in the social hierarchy. So as I said, women were not allowed to give evidence in the court of law. So to put it bluntly, if one man killed another man, and the only witnesses were 500 women, from a legal point of view, nobody saw. Because a woman was not allowed to give evidence in the court of law. So unless they could find an adult male in the course the widow and the orphan were very special problems here, because the widow had no husband and the orphan had no father. So unless they could get an adult male to take up their cause, they were legally voiceless in that society. And then the amazing thing that happened on Easter Sunday morning is that Jesus says to the woman ""go tell the Apostles"". You know if you read the ending of Luke, it's very clear in the late of this patriarchy that the apostles rejected the word of women, because it was just women speak, ""Oh we don't take that seriously, its just a bunch of women"". In fact later on there were thinkers who were anti-Christian who use that argument to say a Resurrection could have never taken place. There was a Greek philosopher in the 2nd century after Christ named Celsus. And his argument was that this is a silly story, the story about our Jesus Christ coming back from the dead. Because all we really have to go on is a word of, he said, a bunch of hysterical women.When you think about the fact that women give evidence to the resurrection of Jesus Christ, that they were commissioned to tell the story of the risen Lord to the apostles, it is actually a kind of argument in favor of the resurrection that really happened. If you were going to make this stuff up in the ancient world, you wouldnt say, well, we found out that from a bunch of women! But the fact is that Jesus, the risen Lord takes seriously the word of women. And that is the way it went with Jesus throughout his earthly ministry. Over and over again, Jesus reached out to people and took people seriously who were not taken very seriously by the rest of the people in that culture. You know the Jews hated the Samaritans. And yet Jesus had this wonderful conversation with a Samaritan woman. And when that lawyer said to Jesus who is my neighbor? Jesus actually uses as an example the story of the Good Samaritan, which violated all of the prejudices and stereotypes of that day. The people that Jesus preached to hated tax collectors, and yet Jesus took seriously Zacchaeus. The people of Israel really hated the Roman occupying soldiers and yet Jesus, when the Roman centurion came and said my daughter has died, Jesus went to his house. Over and over again, Jesus takes seriously people who were not taken seriously in that culture and in a very special way on Easter morning. Jesus reached to people who were not taken seriously in that culture and give them voice go tell the disciples that I have been risen from the dead. So the woman rushed off and it says, as they rushed to meet the disciples, they were filled with both fear and joy. You know the joy part was fine, thats why we are having such a joyful time this morning. But Jesus himself appeared to them and dealt with the fear part of it all. And Jesus comes to them and the very first word that he says to them, after he said greetings, he says dont be afraid, you dont have to be afraid. And in response to that word from Jesus recognizing that this was indeed the risen Lord. It says, And they fell down and they worshiped him. You know all that says something important to us this morning. You know the Apostle Paul, through one of his Epistles, says to us through the inspiration of Holy Spirit that he hopes that we may know Jesus and the power of his resurrection. What does this mean for us gathering here at Haidian Church in Beijing this morning in this 21st century, in this very exciting nation of China? What does it mean for us to know Jesus and to know the power of his resurrection? You know John Wesley, one of the great reformers of the church who established the Methodist movement in England. He talks about the time that he began to come to know Jesus in a very new and special way. He was on a boat with some missionaries, and at one point, one of the missionaries asked him, Do you believe that Jesus died on the cross and was raised from the dead? And Wesley said, Yes, I believe that. The missionary went on and asked him, John Wesley, do you believe that Jesus died on the cross and was rise from the dead for you? And Wesley said, I wasn't quite sure, I cant answer that question. And later on the Lord Jesus came into his life in a very special way so that he not only intellectually acknowledged that Jesus died on the cross and he was raised from dead, but he came to experience in his own life that the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ was something that happened for him, for John Wesley. And it is so important for us today to hear this message from Jesus himself that he died on the cross and he raised from the dead for each one of us. It means something for our life today. You know it is really a kind of amazing story, this guy comes back from the dead. Once ago we hear about this kind of thing. I read something not a while ago. About somebody who claimed that he was in the hospital, and the nurses and doctors declared that he was dead. That happened for about 15 minutes, and suddenly he awoke up, he was revived. He said I really was dead for 15 minutes and then I come back to life! When I read about that, I said yeah, maybe, it could be. Nothing much hangs on it me. I dont have to decide. Its sort of like the really weird story I once read about. Im not even sure this was a true story. But I read about it in a newspaper that a woman once got so angry with her Canary, her pet bird, that she flushed it down the toilet. And weeks later the bird was still in the pipe singing all the time and keeping her awake all the night. When I read something like that, I said ""yeah, maybe."" Im not sure. I dont really have to make a decision. But the story of Jesus Christ coming back from the dead is a story we had to make a decision about. Because if it is true, it is the most important truth that you can ever encounter. If it is true, you should make a huge difference in everyone of our lives. If it is true, it is the greatest thing that ever happened in human history, that Jesus Christ is risen from the dead, and he that is risen indeed. Because it fits into a lot of other important things we hear about in the scriptures and we heard it already this morning. God so love the world that he give his only begotten son that who ever believes in him should never perish and should have everlasting life. Jesus died on a cross, and he was raised up, and that is true! You and I can have everlasting life! We do not have to be afraid of death, and very often we are afraid of death. You know in my country we are still kind of obsessed with death, some of it is kinda fun stuff. We have a lot of TV programs, maybe some of you know about Vampires, and we have known about Zombies and all kinds of people coming back from the dead, and various TV programs, movies and novels, and the like. Part of it is entertainment, but part of it is also a kind of obsession with that. There is an underlying fear. It is natural for this kind of fear that, what we think about the realities of death of human life. But if this story is true, we do not have to be afraid, as Jesus Christ has conquered death and also the sin that has condemned us to eternal punishment. Unless we accept the sacrifice that God has offered to us in Jesus Christ. Christ has risen, he is risen indeed! The most important thing that any of us can consider. For God so loved the world, that He gave us his one and only son. If Jesus comes to the women on that first Sunday morning, he said that do not be afraid. If Jesus understands their fears, he understands their deepest concerns, that was not just he died on a cross, but he came into alive as a little baby. You know in the Old Testament he says one point, in the book of Isaiah, as they will come a day that God will bear his arm, and he will show his power to the nations of the earth. When the people of ancient Israel heard that God will bear His holy arm, the image was that he was going to roll up his sleeves and make a fist really will let people have it. God is going to bear his holy arms. When God finally decided to bear His arms, he went to a manger in Bethlehem, and this tiny little baby stretched out those arms. And He entered into our condition, and he lived a life where he found out, God himself, the second person of trinity, found out what its like to be people like us. The Epistle to the Hebrews says that Jesus Christ is a great high priest who passed through the heavens to enter into our condition. And that because he lived in a kind of life that we lived, and suffered in a way we have suffered and was tempted in a way that we are tempted, but was without sin. We know that we have a great high priest; we have a savior, who really understands what its like to be us. Jesus Christ understands what it is like to be You! So important for us is to recognize that as we look back and we see the words that he spoke to the women after they see the empty tome and He said do not be afraid, and this is because Jesus who knows what is be afraid. He trembled in the guard he sweat drops of blood, he said to the father that let this cup pass from me. Ill do anything rather than face this. God the father told God the son that he had to go to the cross that he had to suffer, be crucified. He said, nevertheless, not my will but I will be done. He took that extreme and ultimate suffering on our behalf, upon himself. Jesus, when he said do not be afraid, he knew what it was like to be afraid. He knows what is like to be one of us. He understands our fears. We come from China, we see a lot of things that weve had around in United States for a long time. Saw a lot of Easter bunny ears here this morning, even here at this church. I saw people on bicycles carrying balloons and talking about eggs, Easter bunnies and all the rest here. You are getting a lot of stuff as same as we have. I know you are starting get some Santa Claus at Christmas time too. In the year 2000, an organization in Finland called Santa Claus Foundation, decided they would going to introduce Santa Claus to China, because Finland claims that thats were Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus originally came from, and they feel they wanted to build strong bonds between the nation of Finland and the great nation of China. The Santa Claus could be a kind of bearer of the bonds between the two nations, and so I know around Christmas time you are starting to see some Santa Claus here in China.I had an experience with Santa Claus once when I was 5 years old. In this experience, I think about when I read about the women coming into the presence of risen Christ and being so afraid. You know theres another story like that, in the Bible, right in the last book of Bible, in the 1st chapter of book of Revolution, the Apostle John who traveled for several years with Jesus, he is referred to as the beloved disciple, John knew Jesus very well during Jesus earthly ministry. Now John is an Apostle of Jesus Christ, one of the greatest disciples, and early Apostles. Hes been sent into exile on the Isle of Patmos. And here he is on the Sabbath, on the Lord s Day, he said I was in the spirit on the Lords day. He was worshiping God and all of a sudden he heard a commotion. He was all alone on this island. He went to where he heard the commotion, he said I saw this awesome being. He said his hair was like wool, and his eyes were like blazing furnaces. And he said his voice, when he spoke, was like the voice of mighty waters, a booming voice. He said when I saw this being, this awesome being, I fell done before him, as if I were dead. I was so afraid. Then the voice spoke and said, Dont be afraid, just as what he said to the women, because I am the one who lived and died and behold and live again forever more. he was telling John Hey John, its me. Its Jesus. When I read about that, when I read about the women, and encountering the risen Christ and being so afraid, and then John said when I saw this awesome being, I fell down on my face in front of Him, I was so afraid. I think about what happened when I was 5 years old, just my first year in school. I was in the classroom that day, all of us little kids. The teacher had planed a surprise visit from Santa Claus. We didnt know that Santa Claus was going to come. So we were doing our 5 years old stuff as little kids in the classroom, and suddenly the guard burst open, and Santa Claus came in, and his hair was like wool, and his eyes like blazing furnaces, and when he spoke it was like the sound of mighty waters, he said Ho ho ho! Boys and girls, Im Santa Claus, and Ive come into this classroom to find out who has been naughty or nice this year. We were so afraid, we were frozen to our seats, afraid. And the teacher, in the plan of surprise, put a chair in front of Santa Claus, and he sat down. He said I would like some boys and girls in this class to come up and sit on my lap and tell me whether youve been a good boy or a good girl this year. None of us moved. Santa Claus looked around that classroom, and he pointed straight to me, said Richard, come on up. I almost didnt get out of my seat, I was so afraid. Finally, I made it up to the front, Santa Claus pulls me up to his lap, and he could feel me trembling with fear. Now, here is what I did not know, Santa Claus was really a guy from our church name Mr. Cooper, and Mr. Cooper was a really nice guy. When Mr. Cooper dressed like Santa Claus, realized that I was so afraid, he whispered in my ear so that no one else in the room could hear. He said Richard, its ok, its me, its Mr. Cooper. And I relaxed. I often think that the women see this awesome being, they were so afraid, and then Jesus says to them, in voice that is familiar to them Dont be afraid. John, falls as one who is dead before this awesome being, then Jesus says Hey John, its me. Its ok. Its me, its Jesus, you dont have to be afraid, Im the one who lived, and died, and behold and live again forever more. I hope you could hear Jesus say that to you this morning, maybe you need to hear that for the first time this morning from the living Jesus. Maybe youve heard many times before, but on the Easter Sunday morning I hope each of us can hear it again today. You may have come to this church afraid this morning, maybe afraid about a relationship that you are in, maybe afraid about your economic future, maybe afraid about some health issue in your life, maybe afraid of things that you are not willing to share with any another person. We all bring fears with us to church on Sunday, and you may have brought some pretty important fears with you this morning. I hope that this morning, you can hear Jesus say to you Dont be afraid. Its me, its Jesus. Im the one who lived, Im the one who suffered in all the ways that you have suffered, Ive been tempted all the ways that you have been tempted. I know what its like to be to you. You know what? I went to the cross for you. I shed my blood for you on the cross of Calvary. I want to forgive you of all your sins, do for you what you could not do for yourself. If you trust in me, you can live with me forever, in my eternal kingdom. Hope you could hear Jesus saying that to you, in the deep places of your own being.Christ is risen, Christ is risen indeed. Alleluia! Amen.Pastor Wu:Dr. Mauw, thank you so much for the great message you shared this morning with us. I love it and I think everybody here loves the message you just shared with us. The message you were just sharing with us is about the most important truth that everybody here should hear. Its about eternal life. Everybody who has ears is suppose to listen to the message. So I love it, and I believe all the ladies in particular would be in favor of the message that you just shared this morning, because come and see the empty tomb, those are some of the words give to us by Jesus through those ladies. Without those ladies, we have no chance to hear the resurrection today. You pointed out to us, so I believe all the ladies here this morning must be very happy, isnt that right? But I in particular am in favor of what you have shared that everybody who has ears should listen to this most important truth to our life. So I think I have made the right choice in choosing a seminary to go for my doctor study. Thank you so much again. In three weeks I will be at your college again, so thats another honor. And thank you again for the honor that we have of having you this morning sharing this message with us. Thank you!You see in Haidian Church, all the congregations here are so blessed that throughout years we have so many pastors and preachers to share the Good News with us. I share sometimes, and sometimes Jessica and other pastors in Haidian Church try their best to bring up their good explanation of the Bible, the Word of the Lord, and share those words with us. So we are blessed. But also we are not only blessed today this morning by the message we just listened to, given to us by Dr. Maul. We are going to have another special guest to celebrate Easter together with us. He is a musician, and also a great evangelizermusically speaking. He is originally from India, but hes been travelling around the world, to over 250 countries. In those countries, he shared the Good News, shared what happened to him. He said that courage and power is that which God put upon him when he has been travelling, evangelizing and baptizing the nations. We are more than happy and are blessed today to have him to share musically and also testimonially with us as he is playing music. So lets welcome Benny!Benny:Good morning everybody. Christ is risen and it is good morning and its wonderful to be here. Thank you Pastor Wu for this opportunity. My name is Benny and Im going to quickly share a short testimony about my life and play you a song. Indeed, in the age of 16, doctors gave me 6 months to live, and they said you will not be able to survival any more. When I come here for Easter, it reminds me back of how Jesus was risen in my life, the impact that happened in my life. I was born in a very highly educated family. My father was an aerospace scientist, who designed airplanes. He looked at me as the first-born son that was expected to become like him. Very soon I became the shame and the curse of my family, not be able to keep up their expectations. I was born with asthma. And from the age of 2 to the age of 16, I was given wrong medication. They found out at my age of 16, the 60% of my lungs were damaged and my immune system was broken down. And basically there was no more life left in me. I was so depressed and so discouraged. Every direction I went that said you are useless, you are worthless. And by 10th grade, they took me out of school, they said its not worth for you to study Benny. And even musically I thought let me try something. At the age of 15 I went for music lessons, on the first day my guitar teacher told me not to come back any more. He said you have no gift and talent of music. So there was nothing good in me left. And at 16 I contemplated to commit suicide. I want to tell you my dear friends, that suicide is never the answer to any difficult problem, no matter how challenging life gets, suicide is never the answer. During that despairing time I went to a youth camp, and I heard the voice of Jesus. On the second day, He spoke to me, saying, Benny even though you are called useless, I still need you. And I told Jesus Why do you need me, when the whole world says Im useless, Im worthless, my own father thinks Im worthless, why do you need me? Then he said that he died on the cross, and he rose again on the third day, so that even my life, my broken worthless life can be transformed.Easter is not only for Christians, its for the entire world. Jesus died on the cross for every one of us, including an useless young Indian like me. So I gave my life to Jesus, he transformed me and made me this new creation. I put my life into the hands of Jesus, I went to the Bible college, thought I would become a pastor, and I did become a pastor, but God said Benny I have a special plan for your life Now, my dream was to go to one country in my lifetime. My father went to two countries, my mother went to two countries, I thought having one country as a dream is correct. But God says that his ways are higher than our ways, his thoughts are higher than our thoughts. He is no respect of people, doesnt matter which passport you hold, what economic background you come from. When God chooses, He chooses for His own purpose. And here, I told Jesus, This is my dream to go to one country, what is the dream, what is the plan you have for my life? And so He said Benny Im going to take you to every nation. I said Jesus Do you know I have an Indian passport. And an Indian passport means having so many visasits tough! He says no. In 2002 he told me Im going to take you to every country by 2010. I said this is impossible. Well, the Bible says what is impossible for man is possible for God. So I put my faith in Jesus, I said Lord, as a little Indian, I will never ask for money, never borrow money, never take a loan and no credit. You provide for me, I will travel; you dont provide for me, I will not travel. Very simple life of faith, and I started my journey.Today, this is half of my passports. I didnt bring all my passports. I have 13 passports together for my travels. God has been so faithful to His word. 245 countries. They said I broke the world record, I didnt know about the record. This is my world map, all the travels that I have done, to 245 countries. And on the 22nd of November, 2010, I broke the world record. I became the fastest man to travel to every country and continent, including Antarctica in 6 years 6 months and 22 days, and made history for Jesus.Today, if God can use a broken ordinary person like me, young ones and old ones, He has plan for each and everybody seated here. Dont give up, just put your hands into this resurrected Jesus, who kept His word that on the third day he will rise again, and He rose again. Im going to close with this one song, the song that I enjoy playing the most. Again, I have no musical education. It is Gods transformation of my musical journey that brought me to this place. I was invited for the Olympic Games in Greece in 2004 to perform on a cultural stage. They strictly told me you can not share your faith. For me, what Jesus has done and really gave me hope, at 16 I wanted to kill myself, and he says I have a beautiful life for you Benny, if you restored my life, I cant keep it secret. I want to share it to one more person so that they can find hope. So they just told me, we just want your music. So I prayed to Jesus for an idea, to design a guitar that the world has never seen, so that this guitar can attract people to come and talk to me, look at the guitar, ask me questions, and I can share my testimony back to them. This is the worlds first and only guitar in this world to have drums inside. As I play the song, I just want to tell you, if God could use fingers with arthritis to play an instrument like this, if you could restore a broken vessel like me, to travel to the nations, there is nothing impossible for them. The song is called My Jesus, My Savior, Lord there is none like you. Enjoy the song."

Before we start the service, I want to share a short story with all of you. Yesterday I attended a ten-year ceremony of one of the choirs in this church; this choir was my first ministries when I came to this church. I was very touched by seeing how God works in each of our lives when I attended this ceremony. Many people no longer are serving here in this church though, as God sent them to different places in China, or other churches in Beijing. When I talked with them and heard their testimonies, I found that its really good that our God works in each of our hearts and lives, and God makes us grow spiritually through many different ways. I also felt very encouraged by the love of each other. You know we humans are limited. Sometimes we would have quarrel with each other, and we often make mistakes and easy to get angry just because of some small things when we were young. But several years later, we would find that actually its good for us because God wanted to use them to make us grow, and let us know that we need to grow in Him in different areas. Many people came back here from different places, when we got together yesterday, we did not have any quarrel with each other because we know that was a great chance for us to get together again.So dear brothers and sisters, I just want to share with you: to love one another and build up each other in Christ, and then our God will work in our heart and in our lives, and God will let us grow. So let us bow down and pray together before the service.Dear Lord, our Heavenly Father, Holy Spirit, Trinity God. We are so thankful for what you have done in our lives. Thank you so much for sending your One and Only Son Jesus Christ to this world for the sake of loving us. Lord Jesus Christ, thank you so much that through your blood, we can come to God and be accepted by God. Lord Jesus Christ, we know your love is amazing and powerful, which changes our lives. Lord we know not because we loved you first, but because you loved us first, so that we can realize your love and then come to you. Lord please help us and teach us and let us unite in you; help and teach us and let us love each other, accept each other, and build up each other in Christs love.Lord Jesus Christ, today I want to lift up all the brothers and sisters here in your hands. Lord we know that each of us is the one you love best and died for, and the one you want to renew our lives and give the eternal life to, and make our lives abundant. Lord please speak to us through your servant and let us know how amazing that Jesus Christ you can accept us and save us from the darkness. God today our brothers and sisters have different prayers in our life, job, and family, please come to us, let us feel your presence, strengthen us through your Word. God today I especially lift up your servant Gloria in your hands, please be with her, send Holy Spirit upon her, and anoint her with your oil; through her we can know your power, your love and your will to all of us, let us be united in you through Jesus Christ. I want to lift up all the people who serve you here in your hands, please be with us; especially I want to lift up the technical team, host team and worship team in your hands.Let us be united in you through Christ, serve together for Christ, and see your glory here in this church. We want to praise you and worship you, I want to lift up the rest of our time in your hands, please be with us. Let all of us feel your presence, and be touched by your power and your love. Pray in Jesus name. Amen.Sermon: Gloria LiWe are one in ChristGood morning everyone, could you please join me with a prayer.Dear Heavenly Father: thank you so much for giving us a chance to worship you, to listen to your Word.

So Lord please come to us and may you speak to our hearts, may your Holy Spirit come upon us, giving us your strength. Lord, I want to lift up myself into your hands, you know my weakness and heart. So please put your power upon my weakness, and may all of us see the Gospel of power in you. Lord, may you be with us and protect the rest of sermon time, may you be glorified through us, we pray in your name, Amen.Firstly, I want to share a story, last Monday, I went to Yuyuantan Park with one of my friends, and my friend found a stone. When I saw this stone, I was so excited because it was shaped like a heart, and I had been looking for a heart-shaped-stone for a long time. You can see on the PPT. When you see this side of the stone, there are several spots on it, but when you turn it over, you can see a smooth beautiful heart. This stone made me think about our own life. In Christ, we are considered righteous people in Gods sight. However, we still have a lot of sins after we were saved. So recently, I think everyone in this world is both lovely and horrible, do you agree with this? Do you think you are both lovely and horrible? Sometimes we are very good, as a Christian, we are very spiritual in others eyes. We love God and we love to serve Him and others, we love to encourage and support others, to help others who are in need. But we also still have some flaws which we need God to remove from our own life. Like the flawed side of this stone. Many spots or sins are inside of us, because of our own sins or sins of others, sometimes we couldnt accept others, even though we are all Christians at church, even though we are on the same mission, we still fight with each other, and guess what? When I look at Ephesians 2:11-22, I can see the exact same thing happened in the church almost 2000 years ago. There were some people who had some problems with unity. Well, who were the exact people having problems with unity in Ephesians 2? There were two main groups that didnt get along in the church: the Jews and the gentiles. First, we all know Jesus Hes a Jew. Christianity started first among Jewish people. Its not among us, but among Jewish people. However this wasnt the only reason to lead a unity problem. But for Jewish people, they had a very strong cultural identity as Gods chosen people. In the Old Testament, we are told that God were  pursuing Jewish people with His passionate love.And who are gentiles? They are not Jews, you know what that means? Ill give you an example. When in the temple, many Jewish people they would thank God like this: Lord I thank you, Im not a woman, Im not a slave, Im not a gentile. So Jewish people thought themselves as holy people. They thought they were called by God. They had a calling from God and they are holy people in Gods eyes, they are chosen people by God. So they despised gentiles, they didnt believe gentiles would have a chance to go to Heaven one day. As Ephesians 2 shows, they called gentiles as uncircumcised. They believed gentiles were excluded from the citizenship in Israel as well as the covenants and promises with God. So here we can see how this would lead to a problem of unity. But dear brothers and sisters, our Gods work is beyond all peoples imagination including that of Jewish people. The promise of forgiveness and redemption are not only for Jewish people but for all the people whom God had chosen according to His will. As the Passion Week just passed, we remembered Jesus death and why He died, He died for all sinners. Through His blood, God does save Jewish people, and God also saves gentiles. Because of His sacrifice on the cross, Jesus has destroyed the barrierthe dividing wall of hostility. So when we go back to the heart-shape-stone story, it makes me think we are all in the process of being formed in Christs image of love, the Holy Spirit is working inside our hearts to save us, to work out the flawsTherefore as we work together and surrender our lives to the Lord, our lives can be transformed by God. We can be unified and turned into one heart, one body in Christ. We can build a beautiful picture--a heart of unity. But there are two major temptations a Christian may face in relationships to cause the unity problem: One is to think too highly of himself; the other is to think to lowly of himself. For those who are tempted too highly, the Bible says in Romans 12:3-6: For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with somber judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you. Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. So all of us here, you may think you are so powerful, you may think you are so smart, but no matter how powerful you are, no matter how smart you are, no matter how talented you are, no matter how beautiful you are, no one is more valuable than others, we all make up the family of God together. Remember we all make up the family of God together, we all make up the unity together, because we are one, because we are all in Christ. We can make a heart of unity. Conversely, some of you think you are not that great, maybe you are a Christian, but you dont feel like you are very important. You dont feel like you are very good. And to you, the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 1: 26-29: Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. God chose the lowly things of the world and the despised things-and the things that are not- to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him. Recently I also keep thinking I am not good enough. Even though I am an associate pastor at church, maybe in your eyes, you think:Oh, you are a pastor, you should be very spiritual. But in my own life, in my daily life, I still make many mistakes. Somehow I am impatient. I dont love others. I dont like this person. I may have some weaknesses. So I keep thinking: why did God save me? I ask God: Lord, why do you save me? Why did you decide to choose me as your servant? Why did you decide to die for me, for this ugly person, for this sinful person? Because I am good? Absolutely not! Because I am able to become a better person by myself? Absolutely not! Why? Why did you save me? Why did you die on the cross? Why did you suffer so much for the sake of me? I am not worthy. So I keep thinking why. The only reason is because of our Lord Jesus Christs unending love, unconditional love, unchanging love. Why did He call me to be His servant? Because I am better than others? Because I am more spiritual than others? I dont think so. I think it is because when I stand here, when I stand on this stage, when I stand to speak His Word to others, it is only to testify Gods power. It is only a testimony of Him. I am a testimony of Him. It is not because I am more spiritual. It is not because I am better than you. It is only because God wants to use a weak person to glorify His Holy name to testify the Gospel is the power of God. So as the rest of 1 Corinthians 1 continues in verses 30 to 31: It is because of Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God-that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. Therefore, as it is written: Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord. So, can you remember this? It is because of Him that you are in Christ Jesus. Dear brothers and sisters, dear friends, why we can be in Christ? It is all about Him. It is because of Him we are in Christ Jesus. It is because of Him we are in Holy Spirit. It is not because I can have good behavior. No, it is not because of me, it is not because I can change my life; it is not because you have talent so God use you. Its only because of Him. So we are in Christ Jesus. Even though I am not good, God still uses me to glorify His Holy name. Dear brothers and sisters, you may be like me, a sinful person, a totally sinful person, a totally guilty person, but to be saved by Jesus Christ. But God wants to use people like you and me and we serve together with different personalities and different gifts. You may have a gift of preaching; you may have a gift of playing guitar; you may have a gift of singing; you may have a gift to welcome others, to smile to others, to host others; you may have a gift to make videos. But with all of different gifts, we work and serve together, and we can turn into one body, one heart in Christ. We can make up a heart of unity. To be saved by Christ because of His transformation, we make up the most beautiful picture in this world--a beautiful heart of unity. So what should we do, how do we pursue this heart of unity Christ desires for us?1 Peter4:8: Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.So dear brothers and sisters, let us be full of Gods love, and use this love to cover our own sins and overlook the faults of others. And then we can join together to be one beautiful heart to serve our Lord together, to serve in unity. But where does this love come from? Dear friends, brothers and sisters, have you ever tried to love someone in your own strength? Its really difficult. Isnt it? If I love someone else completely, what if they dont love me back? But where does this love come from? That comes from the important fact of our identity in Christ. Because Christ accepts us, we accept others. We can support and love others. John4:19: We love because He first loves us.We are secure in our identity as Gods beloved, so we are free to love others. So according to Ephesians 2, what is our identity in Christ? We can see from the first part of Ephesians 2, like two weeks ago what Randy shared: We have been saved by Jesus Christ. This is by grace and through faith. Paul continues in Ephesians 2 from verses 11 to 21 by saying who you are in Christ. Lets look over what is our new identity in Christ. First, you are brought near Christ because of His bloods You have peace for Jesus is our peace; through his sacrifice, he reconcile us with our God. Because of Christ, gentiles and Jews become one family.You are reconciled with God by Christ. Gentiles and Jews both have access to the Father by one spirit. You are follow citizens with Gods people. You are members of Gods household. You are built by Christ. Gentiles and Jews are one instead of two. We are unified. Gentiles and Jews are holy temple. Gentiles and Jews divinely live by His Spirit. You know what? In the past, in Jewish peoples eyes, gentiles could not be saved by God and they should be perished and go to the hell. But now gentiles and Jewish people can become one. They become one new family, only one family, not two families, instead of two but only one. Because of Christ, we have our new identity, we can be one together, and we can be unified. When I meditate on Ephesians, I feel like this Book explains grace very clearly and describes our new identity in Christ. Because of this new identity, we are free to love others. We are transformed by God; we are transformed in Gods kingdom so we are able to love others. So all of the believers here, you may be feeling pretty good about yourselves and know how you should love other brothers and sisters because we are in one, we are united in Jesus Christ. But what about those who are not our brothers and sisters in Christ? How should we treat them? Do we have to love them too? Well, let me tell you a story. I remember when I was in the U.S., the church I visited had a high-school ministry, this ministry had a very special activity which they organized all the high-school leaders to go to the downtown Portland one night to help some homeless people. When I heard this news, I wanted to go there as well. So I went with them and there were many high school students from different churches attending this activity. We divided them into three groups, one was called Under the bridge whose purpose was to serve homeless people there because many homeless people stayed under the bridge. And we played games with them, washed their faces, cut their hairs, share the Gospel with them, and provided food and clothes to them. Another group walked around the city and met some homeless people there and introduces Jesus Christ to them. The last group walked all over the city and prayed for them. I was in the first group.  And you know what? This was my first time that I saw so many homeless people. To be honest, some of them seemed really weird to me and I was a little bit afraid to get near them. But then when I thought of Christs Love, that He never excluded anyone. When he died on the cross, He died for everyone, not only for lovely people. From that moment, I felt free from being afraid to come to them, and spent some time with them. This story reminds me that no matter who is in front of you, dear brothers and sisters, no matter who is in front of you right now, the model that Christ sets forth for us is to come to them, to love them. May we live out what we believe and attract more and more people to see Gods glory through us. Those of you dear friends, you perhaps do not know Jesus yet; you may be feeling you are outside the group, outside the family of unity in Christ. Yes, its true, but what is also true is that God and all the brothers and sisters here, wed love to welcome to you with open arms. Those of you who dont know Jesus yet, you may feel sad right now, and havent been able to find any hope or deep community and friendship in your life. You may even think about suicide, you may think youre abandoned by the whole world that youre unloved and useless. You may have lost of your sense of security because of a hurt in your past. You may not have any peace or any rest. You come to church in hope of finding peace and rest. According to Ephesians 2, you may be like the people Paul described there: you are separated far away from God, you are a foreigner to the Promises of God. You are without any hope in the world, you are without God in the world, and you dont know personally who God is yet. But the good news for you is that our God wants to welcome you to enter into His relationship, His friendship. That is why Jesus is willing to come and suffer because His deep love and desire for you.I dont know how many of you attended last weeks service, but I was here. I was deeply touched by Benny when he shared his testimony. He felt useless, worthless in many peoples eyes. He was told that he had no gift in playing guitar, that he had no gift on music. But now he has been saved by God and transformed by God. When he played the guitar on this stage, we all could see his musical talent even to the extent of making his own unique guitar in the world. He used to be abandoned by the world, but now he was saved by Christ. Because of Christ, he is a member of Gods family. Because of Christ, even if we have different nationalities, we are one in Christ, we can make up a heart of unity in Christ. I dont know all of you well, but I do know some of you here. You may be facing some difficulties or struggles; you may think you are useless or worthless just like the way Benny thought. But because of Christ, we can be made new and one in Him. So dear friends, if you are not familiar with Christianity basically, I want to tell you, please come to Jesus, please come to God, please come to this big family. In this family, we would like to love each other, support each other, serve each other and help each other. Its not from our own abilities, its not because Im a good person, I can love you but only because Gods grace and love. So we can love each other. Jesus has made one new family and has invited us to join this family, so we are together and we love each other. So dear friends, if you are in a dark time, if you feel useless in worlds view, may Gods Word comfort you and give you a new perspective. You are precious in Gods eyes, He loves you so much that He gives His most beloved Son to save you. Hes willing to transform your life and make you to be built on the Holy Rock and dwelling in you which God lives by His Spirit. We all know one familiar verse: John 3:16 For God so love the world that He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. So Im going to end with a short video. When you watch this short video, I hope it can remind all the believers here of why we should have a heart of love and unity toward others, why we love others, why we have a heart to love, and also to remind those who dont know Jesus yet, why our Lord Jesus is a great friend to help. May we can benefit from it. "

We thank you. In Jesus name, Amen. Scripture Reading: Ephesians 3:1-13Scripture Reading: Ephesians 3:1-13 1 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--2 Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you,3 that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.4 In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,5 which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.6 This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.7 I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power.8 Although I am less than the least of all God's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,9 and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.10 His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,11 according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.12 In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.13 I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory. Kathy Zhangs sermon: The Mystery of GodGood morning, please join me in a very short prayer:Lord, have mercy, please send your Spirit to this place. Fill our heart, open our eyes and ears so we may understand your mystery; so we may have the confidence and boldness to enter into your mystery and to taste all of it. May the words from my mouth, and the meditation from my heart are all from you, and be pleased in your side, in Christs name we pray. Amen.Every year, especially in the season of spring, we have many suicide cases. Last month, there was a girl from Nanjing who caught the eyes of many. She had a Weibo micro blog and her named is called Zoufan. She wrote everyday and updated the words everyday about her depression, and her words are beautiful in such a way that touched so many. Many people transfer the messages, and watched her, try to persuade her and try to help her. And she put on her last words saying that: ""Yes, I have depression and I'm going to kill myself."" And then she died. She was a college student, and many people reviewed all her words, and some even just picked some best words from her blog and put on it. A friend of mine who suffered depression came to me and talked with me about this girl, so I read her blog and was shocked, and I was just touched by her words, especially that kind of deep depression and desperation in her words. It's kind of loneliness, helpless and hopeless, a kind of separation with all the things from her, even her mother.Separation, that's the point that will make you go to hopeless, and be in the darkness that you cannot see. Actually I look around and later when I talked with many of my friends I notice that actually so many of us are in depression. Life is more and more fast, and there are so many problems, yes, we are developing very fast, and we are materially living a good life now, but we are more depressed. And another friend who told me the other day that he found he has lost his energy in everything, because he said: I can't find the meaning of life, and the more I ponder over the meaning of my life, the less energy I can get, I think everything is meaningless. And because of this, he has the habit of the procrastination, You know, procrastination () is a word that I try to remember these days, he said his procrastination is getting worse and worse, and he couldn't help. Yes, maybe you are coming today to this church, you're also mysteriously brought here, you're also pondering over the meaning of life, and want to know that how Christians would think about it. I don't mean that, there is no Christian doing this, killing themselves or being depressed. Yes, Christian also, but we are a little bit luckier that we have a God to turn to, even in the deepest desperation we may still stretch out to ask for help from God. I hope what we reflect today in Ephesians chapter 3 about the mystery of God can help all of us about this issue. Before I go on we have been reading the Ephesians for several weeks, and the first week David has brought us to review the blessings especially the spiritual blessings in Christian faith. Through believing in Jesus Christ, we receive many spiritual blessings. Later Jessica shared that because of these blessings that we can open our eyes, so we can see the blessings that have already set around us. And we also have the Guest Pastor who shared with us the situation before and after we believed in Jesus Christ, and what are tremendous transformations that can be brought to us if we have this faith. And last week Gloria also shared about the unity, and importance of all can be united together. So entering into this chapter verse one: After Paul has been talking about the union of the Jews and Gentiles, now they have become one body in Christ, with Jesus Christ as the cornerstone, and then he is getting ready to pray for them. So verse one: this is the reason I, Paul, and the prisoner for Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles. He is repeating and hes starting to pray for them, but at this moment, he turned, he digressed, he said something else, instead of praying. If you read your Bible, you will be told that Chapter 3, verse 1 is connected with Chapter 3, verse 14,, so the prayer will not start until verse14, from verses 2 to 13 is a long sentence in Greek without any punctuation. But when we translate, it has to be cutting into the sentences in Ephesians in this letter, there are about eight long sentences and this is the fourth one. So from verses2to 6 Paul explains the mystery, and the word mystery appears twenty-seven times in New Testament, and twenty times used by Paul, so Paul used mystery a lot. And also among this twenty times, 6 times in Ephesians in this letter, and in this chapter we have three times appeared this mystery, thats the reason we focus on mystery. OK, verses 2 to 6 Paul explains the mystery, and verses 7to 13 Paul tells us about his ministry to make this mystery known to the Gentiles his ministries, and in 2-6, verse 2 Paul tells us about his responsibilities. So verse 2 is like this, for surely you have already heard the commission of God's grace that was given to me for you, so I was given this mission to you. Verses3to 5 Paul talks about when and to whom this mystery was revealed, and verse6 Paul tells us the content of the mystery. Now, let us see the content of this mystery. The Scripture said that is the Gentiles have become the fellow heirs and the members of the same body the sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, so the mystery he later told everybody that the mystery was hidden and not known, but now revealed to Paul and to many others, the holy apostles and the prophets, the mystery is the union of believing Jews and Gentiles now in one body. Now remember at Paul's time especially for Paul and those people around them, the world is constituted about just two people: Jews and Non-Jews, especially for Jews. Jews. Non-Jews. What does that mean? Jews are within the circle of God's blessing, Non-Jews are outside the circle of God's blessing. but for Paul, no, there is no such separation of Jews and non-Jews anymore. There is the third reality: that is a new community, you are not called Jews or Gentiles anymore, you are now called Christians, Christs followers.So for Paul, it's very mysterious. He is a Jew. He's a very pious Pharisee, following the deeds, following the Lord. He knows everything. And he is zealously and eagerly pursuing to persecute the Jesus followers. Because he knows that what he is doing, he is very sure what he is doing is for God. And it is right. With all kinds of reasons to do that, to persecute them, to send them to prison, until one day, on the way to Damascus, he was hit, he was caught into this mystery. And this mysterious experience changed him, transformed him. And this mystery revealed to him that this Jewish identity is no longer that important actually, the doors are open, yes, the door has been opened by Jesus. And now through believing in Jesus, we can form a new community, and there was no such separation as Jews or Gentiles. And it is very important that through believing in Jesus Christ, you can be included into a new community.  So that circle or that separation of outsider and insider has been changed. And also, within this community, you usual, or you previous social status, for instance, like owner, slavery, freeman has been changed. You have a new identity. And this welcome is from God, initiated by God. And Paul knows that, and Paul in many letters, not only in Ephesians, in many other letters as well, he stresses on this universal welcome, God is welcoming everybody. For Jews, you think that you are pious, you follow the laws, you follow the ritual in the right way, you keep yourself very clean form anything that is dirty, you think you have the right to enter into this kingdom. No, that was not God said. Also Paul tells the Gentiles as well, you think that now you have been given the freedom to do everything, and you want to do whatever you want to do, and you can discriminate the others or you can overlook the needs of the widows. No, you are not. This is the universal welcome initiated by God. And this universal welcome is free. For me, actually, it's very touching to think about this universal welcome. That means the mystery is that God has already been in love with you, in love with the world long before we recognized it, long before you know it. In the past, you think that you should do everything to please God so that you can be welcomed. No you don't need to worry about that now, God has already been in love with you, already welcomed you. You don't have to please God. This God does not need you to please with actual deeds, or just superior, behavior. No, God has loved you from the beginning, even you are broken, even you are not that perfect. God knows that, God welcomes you. And maybe for some of us, at least for me, sometimes it's a problem. Think of that, in the place, God welcomes everybody, maybe the one I dont  like, or I hate, or who once persecuted me. God will welcome me.. It's going to be a problem for me.I have a classmate, a boy, whose character was very fearsome. He's very nasty, I have to say. None of us likes him. He has a girl friend. He beat her. And the girl friend always wants to be with him. We have tried to convince the girl to leave him, but, no use. He did many things that make us very upset. And we think he has his problem, he is evil, he is bad. And one day somebody told me, he is a Christian now. The one who told me is also a Christian, and the way he told me is like this ""You know what? That guy is Christian now! Can you believe that?"" Then I responded that Yes! Err!"" So immediately I suspect his motivation to become a Christian. I suspect that and I do not feel comfortable. And very interesting, the other thing is that he broke with his girl friend, very suddenly he cut off the relationship and the girl is in a miserable situation, crying everyday. I told this story to another friend, I said this is a bad guy, he beat his girlfriend, he is nasty, and now he is a Christian!"" And my friend very calmly said to me ""what's the problem with you? You think that now he cut off the relationship with his girl friend is a bad thing. But for me, I think, maybe it's because now he became a Christian and he realized that what he has done is a disaster to that girl. Now he wants to be responsible, he wants to be serious and to cut off the relationship. And maybe it's because it's the power of faith has transformed him. I didn't realized that. See, That's the problem! How can we comprehend this universal welcome from God. That is going to welcome everybody even the ones you don't think they are qualified, maybe someone you have known so well, you know all the bad things they have done, and you have not forgiven them, but God has forgiven them long before you can. Are you not going to welcome them? Paul is telling this. Addressing to this problem, because if you are not as open, or if you cannot think from Gods  position, but only think from your own position, you are going to shut the door. And you are going to use all kinds of things to shut the door, and you are going to tie God hands with rituals, with doctrines, with your understanding of God. Remember that, it is a universal welcome, that is extended to everybody. And also it's very interesting that this letter people talking about the central theme of Ephesians. Yes, it's a very short letter but it's very interesting. It is a letter that talks about the trinity, its a letter that talks a lot about the church ecclesiology, it's also talks a lot about Christology, about Jesus Christ, Jesus the Lord. Focus on that. But I still think that what Paul highlighted here is love, the promotion of love. Because all the things, the unity of the church, thats centered on Christ. If we don't have love, we can't do anything, and we can't build a community that's going to be different from other community in the world. And love is because of this universal God.This God universally welcomes everybody. And that is love. Think of that, God loved you long before you could recognize Gods love. And also, the mystery of God is that God welcomes everybody, He opens the door, includes everyone, accept your weakness and your brokenness that God wants to heal. And also, because you belong to this new community, you become His new heir. You are owned now, by God, not anyone else. So each one of us belongs to God; each one of us belongs to God only. That reminds us that we have to respect each other fully because they are also the property of God, and they are also treasure of God, and also precious in Gods eyes. Maybe I do not like them, they are different from us; but they are a treasure of God too. And also because you are owned by God, by Christ, you have a new freedom. Let God Shape Our LivesIn the past, you are not able to shape your life by yourselves. Yes, we are shaped by our parents maybe  your parents want you to be an economist, but actually you like literature more. And you cannot do anything; you go to the school that your parents want you to. And you go to piano classes because your parents want you to. Yes, and you do a lot of things, and you want to earn a lot of money, and you want to live a good life, because the society, all the customs told you to. In the past, you were not able to shape your life. But now, because of this love that has filled in you, empowered you, you have the power to shape your own life, and this life is Jesus-shaped life. It is God-shaped life. God  Given Freedom and HopeAnd it is going to be quite different. And then, this is the freedom, the freedom that you have a new vision to see the world differently, and you can think differently. So you are not bounded to the traditional customs. And you have the freedom and spaces to do the new things. Because of this freedom, we can have hope. This is also the mystery of God that by believing in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, we can have hope. God blessed the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and God will do the same thing to bless us. If we follow Christ, follow the model of Jesus, extend our love to others, and if you have the same faith like Jesus in the same faithful way to follow Jesus Christ, then we are able to have the hope coming into birth in our heart. And then this hope will tell us that we are not separated anymore. You are not alone; you are in a new community; you are given a new hope. Taking the Leaping FaithAfter solving this separation thing, then you can see that your life is meaningful because you have a purpose to live now. The purpose is that you have to live out your faith; and you have to extend the love you have received from God to the others. Again, it is a mystery that how you can carry out all this; how you can be empowered with the energy and wisdom to work out and live out your faith. It is a mystery, and it takes risk. I have to say that faith is a risk. Many people say that, Yes, give me some time, I want to make it clear. I want to reason out everything before I can have faith. But I have to say that like marriage, if you want to reason out everything before you getting into marriage; you are not getting into marriage anymore. Marriage also takes risk. But also, after that risk, you have to believe that God is with you, and God is guiding you. Entering into this mystery is a risk; take this risk to enter into this mystery, and you will see the different world. Understanding Others ProblemsAnd still, I have Christian friends who also suffering from depression and a lot of things. And for me, maybe, it is that I certainly have time  in depression, it is a blessing; but it is a problem also. I cannot understand their problem. We have sympathy, and we also have empathy. A lot of times, something you have experienced is quite easy for you to understand, but if you have not had that experience, it is very hard. So it is a problem for me that when I do not have the problem of procrastination (which I sometimes have, but not very serious), so I cannot understand my friend who has this procrastination problem. I pushed her too much. So I am hurting her in the name of love. So that is problem for me. Still, what I learn from this is that the mystery of God is love, is wisdom, is universal welcome, and also a respect and service that requires me to have more patience like God, to wait, and also keep praying for her and for him, instead of just pushing and criticizing. For those who are suffering or coming here today with a problem in your heart, or with this procrastination problem, I hope that you could try to take the risk to enter into the mystery, and do not push away the people around you who try to help you. For no reason, mysteriously, we cannot explain, stay in the circle and stay in touch. And for those who are trying to help the others, we also make this guidance of the mystery that we can understand that God is mysteriously working on them too, that we need the patience. God Welcomes All of UsLike the wind, the Holy Spirit has been coming everywhere. And the Holy Spirit came after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we are living in the Spirit, and if you pray, the Spirit will be breathed into your heart. And with the Spirit, and by believing in Jesus Christ, we are given the power to get access to God. That is the power, because in the past, we were so stressed by our sin, our brokenness, we were shamed. But now, because of Jesus, because we believe that God sent Jesus to cover our sins so that we can look up to God, and we can access God, and we can pray directly, and ask His help from God. I just hope that all of you can believe that God loves you no matter how bad you are or how good you are, no matter how broken you are or how perfect you are. God welcomes you no matter you are liked or not. God welcomes the others no matter whom we like or not. This is the mystery of God. And what we have to do is to believe in it and hold onto it. May God bless all of us. Do you believe he is your God, he is your savior no matter what comes? He is rock that you can hold on to. He will never let you fall.

God, we ask you to purify our hearts and open the eyes of our spirit, so that we can know you more when we worship you. We want to thank you for the grace that you have given us everyday; we want to thank you for answering our prayers; we want to thank you for carrying our worries and tears. We want to pray for people who are in need; please provide the things they need, so that they can experience your grace and know you more. We want to pray for the people who are facing difficulties. Please help them go through the darkness, because we know you are powerful and you are Almighty God. And we also want to pray for the speaker, the worship team and all the brothers and sisters here. Please be with us, show your presence to us and may your name be exalted through our worship. We pray all these in Jesus name. Amen.Scripture (Ephesians 3:14-21)3:14 For this reason, I kneel before the Father, 3:15 from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name. 3:16 I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 3:17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,3:18 may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, 3:19 and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. 3:20 Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,3:21 to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.The God of all powerGood morning, let us pray: Almighty God and gracious Father, we come into your Holy, Holy presence to worship you to exalt you, to magnify your most Holy name. Your glory fills the earth. Your glory fills the century. Your glory fills our hearts. We are thrilled to be in your presence at this very moment. Father, forgive all our sins, whatever sins that we may be holding onto, forgive us and cleanse us by the precious blood of Jesus so that we may be pure, holy and blameless in your sight. Holy spirit, you alone know the truth and you alone can speak the truth, speak into each and every heart here today that we may lift you up, that our hearts will be a sanctuary, pleasing for you to dwell in and that we may grasp how deep how high, how long how wide is your precious love for each one of us. Speak to us, your servants are listening. We pray all this in mighty and marvelous Name of your Son Jesus. AmenHave you ever felt weak? --Yes. Have you ever worried? Yes. Have you ever felt weary? Yes. Suffering is inevitable. We live in a world wrapped with sins that separate us from our God. We live in a world where there is an enemy Satan who seeks to separate us from the love of God. I am living in the world with this death, that is why we are suffering. As I considered this passage, one thought came into my mind. Life's challenges should never ever be a reason for us to fight or to flee or to faint. Life's challenges should be an opportunity for us to press on in faith and to press in to the Father. I pray that as we study together, that God will change our faith to transform our love. We will grasp the magnitude of how great is our God. Last week Kathy introduced us to Chapter Three in the book of Ephesians and she shared with us the mystery of God and ministry for God. Paul opens this new passage that we are studying today with a prayer. We are going to learn how to pray when we are weak, weary and worried. We are going to divide our passage into three divisions. The first division is called Position. Our second division we are going to call it Petition and the third division we are going to call it Praise. Position--how to pray. Petition--what to pray and Praise--who to pray to. So if you have Bibles, we will open to verse 14 and I will start. Paul, the human author is chained to a Roman solider. This is one of his prison letters and he is going to burst out in a beautiful prayer. What does he say? He says For this reason I kneel before the Father, for whom His whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name. (Ephesians 3:14-15) What is this reason? There are many reasons. In Chapter One, God reveals I am the God of all blessing. I chose you before the foundation of the world. I predestined you to be adopted as my child. In Chapter Two, God reveals Himself as the God of life. I make dead people alive! And in this Chapter Three, He says I make you people, my people one! I make you one. I have destroyed the war of hostility that divided you. Now Jews and Gentile can come to salvation, not by works but by grace, by Gods love, by Gods mercy. We can come into fellowship with God Himself. For this reason, Paul has the ministry to preach the Gospel which is the power of salvation, the power of God to save. Nothing else can save us except Jesus; that is power. He says I kneel before you to worship you, to let you know you are worthy O great God! I kneel to declare not independence; I kneel to declare dependence. I depend on you God and on you alone. I am nothing without you. I can do nothing without you. I kneel before you in submission. I submit to your will. I submit to your plan. I submit to your pleasure. You are my all in all. How many times do you kneel? How many times do you take the time to kneel to Him physically, spiritually or both in a day to express your worship to Him to show your submission and to declare you are depend on God. Our principle for this particular section here. It says God seeks in our prayer. Not our arithmetic or rhetoric, but our faith and fervency. He does not care about the length. He does not care about the frequency. He does not care about you eloquence, but what He does care about is your faith. Without faith, it is impossible to please God. He cares about your passion. When you pray, are you on your knees? Are you praying with your faith? I know who you are and I know what you can do. Do you have that passion to God? My questions to you: Do you know God as your Father and if the answer is not yes right now, it should be yes; otherwise, we are enemy of God, I am sorry. Will you plan to develop a deeper personal prayer life with Him starting this week? The answer isYes.Lets pray together the following slide: I Adore You Father, my protector & ProviderI confess my spiritual laziness & prayerlessnessThank You for creating me & choosing meI Pray for a deeper daily communion with youWe will go on to the next division Petition - what to pray for.  Paul is a prisoner. I bet he is going to pray for freedom. Free me, O God from this prison! I bet he is going to ask God to heal him of all those diseases, all those pains, all those wounds. No. Paul, at this point, is transported into the presence of God. Paul is in the presence of God, moment by moment, day by day, working with God, talking with God, fellowshipping with God. He just says Father, I pray three things for my friends. My first prayer is that: out of His glorious riches, He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being. Riches! We like to be rich. 25 years ago, Forbes magazine recorded that there were about 140 billionaires on the planet. Today, the most recent list recorded over 1,200 billionaires on the planet. Their net worth was approximately 6 to 7 trillion dollars. You will say, wow, thats rich! I wish I could be rich. The founder of Facebook is one of the youngest billionaires on this planet. Oh, how could I be rich like him! Brothers and sisters, you are richer than they are! Your wealth exceeds 7 trillion dollars. But I have never seen 7 trillion dollars in my bank account. What do you mean I am richer? Because Jesus said you are worth it. He paid the price for you. He paid it all with the precious blood of His sacrifice for you. He paid it all and said, In me, you are rich. Exceedingly rich, incomparable rich, because you have every spiritual blessing in Christ. 7 trillion dollars will fade, spoiled, perish, and disappear. Every spiritual blessing will never disappear! Every spiritual blessing will never disappear! Because Christ cannot disappear. You are rich, your Father is rich, and He wants to give you the power of the Holy Spirit. Power! Power to live a holy life, power to overcome temptation, power to resist the devil, power to bear fruit for Gods glory. Power! Power to be what God has called you to be--the child of God, the light of world, salt; to be His bride, His holy one. His ambassador. The second prayer. He says I pray that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love. We will live by faith, everything comes by faith. God has longed for fellowship with us, to walk with us and to have unbroken, uninterrupted fellowship with us. He says I want intimate fellowship intimate fellowship with us, with you and I. The most frequently repeated word in this book is In Christ, In Him, because God has transported us from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light. God has given us a new birth, a new birth into a living hope, a new inheritance, and a new relationship. God has given us a new life in Himself. We live in Him; we move in Him, we have our being in Him. We are inseparable, and that is what he is praying. May you be so intimate with God. You are inseparable, you cant separate. Impossible to separate. Then in his third petition he says in verse 18: I pray that you may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ. When I think about width, I think about how far He has removed our sins, from the east to the west. When I think about the length, how all the lengths that Jesus went through for you and me? Leaving Heaven to come to earth, becoming nothing, to become a man, and then pursuing us from the end of the earth, to save us. When I think about how deep, I think about His death, no one has ever died for me, willingly or voluntarily; no one has ever shown such love to me, such unconditional love. I wasnt His friend and He died for me, I was rebelling, I was disobedient, I loved the darkness, I loved myself more than He. And yet God demonstrated His love towards us while we were yet sinners. Christ died for us. The height is Heaven. Hes gone ahead of us to prepare place for you and I. Where He is, we may be also. We live in Him and He lives in us. God wants intimacy with each of us.Finally he prays in verse 19, I want you to be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. The fullness of God dwells in Jesus Christ. The full divine nature of God dwells in Jesus Christ alone. Jesus is the exact representation of the Fathers being. Jesus is the radiance of the Fathers glory. He alone contains the fullness of God. And He says He wants us to be full and have a full and abundant life. So, as Christ grows more and more in us, we become more and more like Him, we think like Him; we speak like Him; we act like Him; we love like Him; we serve like Him, we become more and more like Christ. So my next principle for the section says Only growth in Christ likeness can truly glorify God and satisfy the soul. God created us to be like Him and to glorify Him as we are more like Jesus, we cannot make ourselves become like Jesus, but as we invite the Holy Spirit to transform us, through our weaknesses, our wary times, our worrying times and our sufferings that we will become more and more like Jesus. So my question to you:Is Jesus dwelling in your heart?Yes. Are you in love with God? Yes. Will you ask God to grow you in Christs likeness and love? Yes.OK, so then our prayer together, our adoration, the next slide:I Adore you Jesus as Lord and Lover of my life.I Confess my faithlessness and self centeredness.Thank you for indwelling and empowering me.I Pray for power to show Your Love practically.Our third division starts in verse20, Paul concludes the prayers in praise and it says Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us. Alright, all these things seem to be too difficult, but for God, nothing is impossible, nothing is too difficult for our God. The power is not in your prayer or your faith, but in the Holy Spirit and in God. If you are struggling and suffering; if you are going through extreme hardships and wondering why its so difficult, Id like to suggest that you start with kneeling in worship, in dependence and in submission. To God for whom nothing is impossible! Is there any need so great that our greater God cannot meet that need? Is there any problem that our wise God cannot solve? The answer is no, no, no, nothing is impossible for our God. And He says that His power is working in us to make us more like Jesus; His power is working for us, so that no enemy or evil power can stand against Him in us. And His power is working through us to spread the Kingdom, to advance the Kingdom, to grow the Kingdom and to grow us into Christs likeness. Paul in his prayer in verse 21 by saying glory to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations (our grandparents, great grandparents, children, grandchildren and their children), forever and ever! Amen. Hes saying glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God in us and through us, in us as we become more like Christ, and through us as we become more like Christ. The principle for this section is: Faith sees in invisible, believes the unbelievable, and receives the impossible. So the questions I have for you:Will you make glorifying God your principal life purpose? Yes. Will you start praying great things in line with Gods glorious will and power? Yes!Let us have our last slide with our prayers:I adore you my Almighty Sovereign Lord.I confess having a limited and low view of you.Thanks for your Power working in me and for me.I pray to expect from your Highest and attempt for you my utmost.As I think about power, we know that from this passage that God is the God of all power. Suffering is difficult and inevitable, and sometimes it seems impossible to endure, but God says I am the God of all power and I can make all things, I can do all things well. I heard of a lady and she too found herself in a difficult situation and probably you will say an impossible situation. She came home from work and found that her mother and husband had been murdered. You can imagine the excruciating pain of losing her mother and husband. She was asked to comment about her loses and she replied: I am only a pilgrim on this earth, and I do not feel as Im an entitled person. God gives gifts, and God takes away those gifts, God gives and God takes away. I will accept the adversity with abundance, because I know my redeemer lives and they will live too. Is this your confession and your faith? Will you put your trust in God of all power? I want to close with the last prayer in our last slide together:Lord, I am willing to receive all that you give, to lack all that you withhold, to surrender all that you take, to suffer all that you inflict, to be and to do all that you require for your glory and pleasure. Amen.Glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God through all generations forever and ever. Amen. PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 6"

Preacher Larry:Good morning, it is my privilege to share with you this morning. Many of you may already have heard that my wife Cinia and I just had our first child. Thank you. Our baby girl Joy came in to the world on February 25, 2012. Now she is 71 days old. (Please turn to another slide, next one.) She is really a wonderful and beautiful gift from God. Every time I look at her, I will say, ""Wow, she is beautiful."" I'm going to say that, she is the most beautiful girl in this world in my eyes apart from her mother. And we are just so blessed to have her in our family. Many people ask me how I feel to be a father. To be honest, very tired, and definitely keeping me busy in the house. But we were very excited to be parents, and there are so many things we learned in the last two months. I'm going share with you a little bit later. Introduction to Ephesians Chapter 4: What God has done for us before?Today we continue to study the book of Ephesians, if you have your Bible with you, please turn to the book of Ephesians, chapter 4, in verse 1, it says,As a prisoner for the Lord"" As you may know, the book of Ephesians was written by Paul while he was in prison in Rome. Paul was not ashamed but was happy to serve God while he was in prison. His physical condition did not take away his joy. The book of Ephesians is a letter that Paul wrote to the church of Ephesus. The purpose of this letter, or book, is to strengthen the Christians in the church of Ephesus. I believe this is also a book, or letter, to strengthen Christians today. Paul says,""As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received."" So brothers and sisters, what is the calling we have received? And to know that, we need to look at that before chapter 4, what did Paul say? Paul spent three chapters to describe what God has done for us. There are so many things God has done for us. Let's look at this slide. As a Christian and Christs follower, we areBlessed in Christ (Ephesians 1:3);Chosen in Christ (Ephesians 1:4);Adopted by Christ (Ephesians 1:5);Redeemed and forgiven in Christ (Ephesians 1:7);Participants in God's good plan in Christ (Ephesians 1:11);Sealed with the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 1:13);Made alive in Christ (Ephesians 2:5-6);Brought near to God (Ephesians 2:13);Members of God's household (Ephesians 2:19) andSharers in God's promise in Christ (Ephesians 3:6).I can go on and on. Brothers and sisters, you need to get this, as Christs follower, we are parts of God's family, the family of the King of Universe. In Christ we are blessed, do you know that? We are blessed and rich in Christ. After we had a child, it definitely helps me understand more about the love of our Heavenly Father. Since we became parents, we have been willing to make all kinds of sacrifices. How? To sacrifice our sleep, getting up midnight, and to sacrifice our time and energy. We want to do that because of love. As parents we simply want to give the best to our child. I remember when Joy was four weeks old, she was ill. I saw her in pain and crying, I just felt that broke my heart, and I felt so bad. I was thinking if I could take her pain and illness on me, and then she could recover, I was willing to do that. I've never had that thought before. I think that is love. You know what, we have a Father in Heaven. He loves us, and He sacrificed His One and Only Son Jesus, and Jesus died for our sins, pains, the penalty of judgment that our sins deserve. You are so precious in God's eyes, God loves you so much. I do not want you to miss this point before you leave this church today. Can you help me tell your neighbor, ""God loves you, you are so precious in God's eyes!"" Can you do that? Help me tell this to your neighbor. Thank you. You are so precious in God's eyes. Your life is valuable to God.Expound on Ephesians Chapter 4: What Gods calling is now?Paul spent three chapters talking about what God has done for us. In the next three chapters, chapters 4-6, Paul explains our duty and responsibility in Christ. What does it look like when we live our life according to what God has done for us? Paul urged people to live a life worthy of the calling we have received. I have shared and talked about that God had already blessed us. We need to respond to His love. He brought us into Gods family; we are united with God; and in Christ we are brothers and sisters. We need to keep the unity God has already made. Here is a word: worthy, means equal with, this means we need to balance our Christian life between calling and responsibility, but not to become a Christian in name only. We need our calling and responsibility to protect and maintain our unity among all believers. You may ask what ""the unity among all believers is?"" Well, before I talk about what unity is, maybe we can think about what unity is not, which means what is the opposite of unity? Well, you can think some words like conflict, division, disagreement and disharmony all this kind of words. Brothers and sisters, I am going to ask you: do you have this kind of problems with other believers? You may have a problem with them, and you do not want to talk to them, you cannot forgive them, and you do not even want to see them.Reading the news, we know that disunity is the biggest problem in church today. We read the news, and we hear about it that the church has a unity problem. They attack each other, they cannot accept each other. Church leaders from different churches, they have this problem to accept each other. And for some believers, they hardly get along with each other. I believer unity is very important to God. Remember the last prayer of our Lord Jesus before He was arrested and crucified? The prayer for church is a prayer of unity. If you read the gospel of John Chapter 17, verses 20-21, Jesus prayed that, for those who will believe in me through their message;that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I think the unity is like the oneness of the Father, Jesus Christ, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Christians can belong to different fellowships, but we all belong to our God and to each other. In the lost world, people cannot see God. But they can see Christians. What they see in Christians will make them think about our God. If they see Christians in love and unity, they will believe that God is Love. If they see Christians in division, dividing, fighting, they will reject the message of the gospel. Unity is about oneness in Gods love, and unity pleases God and brings glory to God. Unity Requires Our Efforts to Maintain.Paul urges us to make every effort to keep the unity of Spirit through the bond of peace. In today's Scripture, there are a lot of verses and I cannot cover them all. But there are a few points that I want you to remember. One point is that, unity requires our efforts to maintain. It tells us that unity requires efforts and does not come naturally. This is only possible through the Holy Spirit. The function of the Holy Spirit is to bring us together and bond us together so that we may have peace. We have talked about that God has blessed us in so many ways. It is our calling to keep unity among us Christians. Unity is about oneness in love. Unity brings glory and pleases God. Be Humble.You may ask, how can I keep unity among all believers? Well, in Verse 2, Paul gave us some applications. Be completely humble, gentle, be patient, bearing with one another in love. To keep the unity, Paul mentioned 'be humble'. He put 'be humble' in the first place. Why is that? I believe selfishness is part of our human nature. It is so easy to consider ourselves much more than others. We can very clearly and quickly see other peoples problems, and are slow to see our own problems. The Bible tells us that being humble means considering others interests at the equal level as ours and be quick to see the good things in other people and be slow to see the bad and be willing to listen first. God wants us to keep unity. God wants oneness in Christ. Humility, I believe, brings unity while pride brings division and causes disunity. And we all have different opinions and the differences need to be expressed in humility and love. We can participate either in keeping the unity or destroying the unity, building into the unity or tearing it down. A lack of humidity, gentleness, patience and love can certainly destroy the unity. Brothers and sisters, which areas do you need to work on? I know there are always some areas that I could not handle well. I feel that I always have a competitive heart. I like to compete with people and compare with other people. I find many times that it is not that helpful. It is definitely not leading me into unity or oneness. So I always have to pray and ask God to help me, remind me and strengthen me. After I became a father, one of the things that I enjoy most is playing with our little girl and talking to her. I always say to her, ""Joy, I wish you could grow quicker so that you could talk to me now. I want to hear from you."" I believe that is also our God' s desire. He wants you to grow in Him, to talk to Him, and share our hearts with Him. When you ask, God wants to help you. We Are of the Same Family!In verses 4 to 6, Paul listed seven things of the unity of all believers, that is one body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism and one Father. No matter who you are, where you are from and what you have done before, we have become Christians, Christ followers and we have the same Father; same Lord, same baptism, one hope, one faith; fundamentally we are the same. We have many things in common: in Christ, we are a new creation, the old has gone and the new has come. God gives us these things and I believe that there is no second class citizen in God's Kingdom and we have the same Lord, same Father, same baptism, same faith and same hope. You may be the only one child in your family. But in Christ you have tons of siblings from all over the world and you can spend eternity with them. Isn't that great? We may be different, but God gives us things in common. You may hear people sharing their testimonies which are so miraculous. You may think why I do not have such a miraculous testimony that I could share with other people. But I want to tell you, we have the same salvation. Fundamentally we are all the same. God gives us the same salvation that we accept the same Lord. All around the world, we have the same father. We may have different gifts, but we have the same Lord, same Father, same hope, same faith and same baptism. Having emphasized the unity among believers, from verses 7 to 16, Paul moves on to explain how we use different gifts to build up the body of Christ. Another point I want to ask you to remember is to use different gifts to build up the body of Christ. In I Corinthians, chapter 12, it says this, 12Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ.Now you are the body of Christ and each one of you is a part of it. You know, Apostle Paul gave us a beautiful picture. Body of Christ, one unit is made up of many parts and they function together. Jesus is the Head of the Church and the head of the body. The Church is the body of Christ and the Church is made up of all believers in Christ. Each individual believer is a part of the body. Use Different Gifts to Build Up the Church.In our human body, we have eyes, arms, hands, feet and legs. They all have different functions, don't they? They work together when they are healthy. With our human body, we can see, jump, run or even win gold medals. When the body moves, each part of the body needs to move together. In this church we have different ministries, we have host team ministry, worship team ministry and small group ministry. We may serve in different areas, and we may have different gifts, but we serve the same God. And I am going to say we are in the same team, team of Jesus. Instead of complaining or criticizing other people for not doing well, we should love each other, support each other and pray for one another. Let me give you one example. We have a team to set up this sound system every Sunday. Sometimes you see the system did not work well, did not finish on time or get done on time. It is very easy to think, why didn't they do well? Instead of doing that, maybe we can help them or pray for them. Sometimes you hear a preacher and at the end of the sermon, you feel, Boo, I do not like the sermon. Have you ever pray for the preacher during the week? Maybe we should do that. Lift them up. Pray for them. Love one another and support each other. We are all in the same team and we are all members of the body of Christ. Jesus is the Head of our church. We are part of his Church. Each part of the body has different use. Each one of us has different gifts, resources and experience. We need to use our different gifts to build up the body of Christ. Some of you may say I do not have any gift. Well, yes, you have. Each one of us is unique and we all have different gifts. Some of you may have a gift of teaching, shepherding, music or administration or designing or hospitality. I believe every one has a gift. One way to recognize our gift or talent is to notice the things we are good at or enjoy doing. Another way is to ask your close friends, or group members or family members to tell you your strength. We need to use different gifts to build up the body of Christ. Have you ever played puzzle before? I brought one today. A puzzle has many broken pieces. They are in different shapes, colors and sizes. But when we put them together, they show up a beautiful picture. A puzzle is a bunch of broken pieces if you do not put them together. I want you to remember this, at the end of this day, you may have forgotten my sermon; or at the end of the week you may forget what I am trying to say. But I want you to remember that we need to keep unity among all the believers. Keep the unity, work together. We all have different gifts so we can build up the body of Christ. Reflection:I want you to take a moment to reflect on today's topic. Maybe you can close you eyes, and think about it. Search your heart and ask yourself a question, How am I doing in living in unity with those around me? Is there any sense of pride that we need to lay before God? Is there any unforgiveness that is still in our hearts? You want to ask God to help you. Maybe you have come to this church for a long time. You have not yet plugged in into this community. It is time to join in and use your gift to serve. Or we can help you and we work together. Some of you may have come to the church for the first time and you may want to ask yourself, Why did not I accept the message of the gospel, accept Jesus as the savior of my life? What is my barrier? You may want to take a moment to reflect on all those questions. Ending Prayer:Heavenly Father, thank you for blessing us. Father, please make us one, make us united. Please fill our heart with your love, help us live up to your calling. We can build up each other and that people can see you in us. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.Transcribed and revised by Bing GUAN, Emily NIAN and Franz HONG with the grace of our Lord Jesus and the movement of the Spirit.Unity in the body of ChristLarry Liu                                                                         6th May 2012PAGE  PAGE  8Haidian Christian Church"

If you have a Bible with you, please turn to chapter 4. Todays scripture reading is from chapter 3 verses 17-24: 17So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. 18They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. 19Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.20That, however, is not the way of life you learned 21when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. 22You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; 23to be made new in the attitude of your minds; 24and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.Todays sermon in titled Put on New Self and will be given by Pastor JessicaPastor Jessica Wang:Good morning, my dear brothers and sisters, before we share God's word, let us bow down and pray together. Dear Lord, thank you so much for your love so that we can stand in front of you. Dear lord, thank you so much for salvation to rescue us from death, from the darkness. But Lord, today we pray that you will please continue to work in our hearts, Holy Spirit, work in our hearts and speak to us. Let us realize that even when we become Christians, we are not perfect. And we need to be renewed by you day by day and we need to live how Jesus lived. Lord, today I want to lift all my brothers and sisters in your hands, please speak to us and touch our hearts, and give us strength so that we can be renewed by you. And also I lift myself in your hands. Be with me and send your words to me. May I myself and the words in my mouth be pleasing to you. I pray in Jesus name. Amen!Dear brothers and sisters, today is mother's day. It reminds me to think of my mom, and also my mom's mom, my grandma. So at the beginning I want to share a story, which my grandma told me.  When I was very young, my grandma told me a story. One day the angel told one of the extremely evil tigers that ""if you meet a Christian next time, do not kill them."" The tiger replied, ""how can I recognize who is a Christian?"" The angel said, ""Christian has a sweet fragrance of Christ."" The tiger said, ""Oh yes. I know"" A few days later, the angel asked the tiger to come again, and asked him ""There was someone who told me that you have killed a Christian and ate a Christian. But didn't I tell you do not eat Christians?"" The tiger said, ""Yes, but I didn't eat his mouth, because only his mouth has the fragrance of Christ.""  We know that it is not a real story. But my grandma wanted to teach me that if you become a Christian, you must be as a Christian in your whole body, not only your mouth. So today I want to use this story to teach us that it's very important to not only speak as a Christian, but to live out a Christian life with our whole being. So I want all of us to think about ""Do we live a Christian life with our whole being?""Today I am going to share with you ""Put on the new self"". We are going to continue study Ephesians, Chapter 4 verse 17-24. Its telling us not to live as a gentile does, but as a Christian of light be putting off our old self and putting on our new self. I'm going to share you in three parts. The first part is talking about what does the old self look like? The second part is how can we put off our old self and put on our new self? The third, how can we apply in our daily life?Let us look at the first part. It is talked about through Chapter 4 verse 17-19. This part is sharing about what does the old self look like. Dear brothers and sisters, we know as we stay in Beijing there are so many things that we know may make us feel angry. I want to show one example. One day when you bought milk, and you found out there is something wrong with the milk, and you can't drink it. What is your reaction to it? And we found out the whole society was deeply concerned about the issues of milk. And milk problems scared people in China. We all worry about the food safety, and began to criticize those who produce the bad milk, the bad food. I just want to show this example and use this example to show us that what does the old self look like. But today's purpose is not to criticize the other people, the non-believers, and the people who did the bad thing. But today's purpose is that I ask the Holy Spirit to come upon us and let us realize what myselfs old self looks like. The other day I got to know there is a person who came to church but he didn't worship God as we did. He stole money and bags when we close our eyes and pray, especially happened in this church. We are very angry about the things he had done. Its not good, its not right. But I use this example with two purposes. One purpose is to let every one of us realize that not every person coming to our church is to praise our God. Maybe that person is still here. But I want to let us take care of your belongings. And the other thing I want to say is to not let us to criticize the other people, but to use this example to let the Holy Spirit renew us, let us know what my weakness is. So I will give you one second and you may think it very seriously that ""what is my weakness and how can we overcome that"". Are our hearts closed toward God? Have our hearts become hardened towards God's words?Do we tell lies?Do we get angry and stay angry?Do we steal?Do we swear and speak bad language?Have we become bitter?Do we Gossip, tell bad or false stories about others? Do we fight with others, hate others?Dear brothers and sisters, I'm sure we are not that safe. But I'm also sure in some way, somehow, and somewhere we still have our own weakness in life. And I myself have one of the weaknesses, especially when I drive in Beijing and meet people who do not obey the traffic rules and almost cause accident. I just get angry and say something. If this happens a lot, it leads a car rage.So dear brothers and sisters, I want all of us to use today's time and think about what is your own weakness. Not only think about this, but also find a way how we can overcome it, how can we put off our old self and put on our new self. The second part is how can we put off our old self and put on our new self? I know all of us are struggling with sin, but also with our desire to do good for God. Like Paul described in Romans 7:18-20, I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. Because of sinful nature, we are struggling with sinful things and struggle with the right thing. There is a fight with each other in our inside. Two selves: one self wants to do the bad thing, the other self wants to do the good thing. Paul described it very well, he said that if I want to do good things but dont, if I dont want to do the bad things but I did it, its not me, its the sin living in me, because the sinful nature. So dear brothers and sisters, we feel so bad about this, we know we cant conquer this and we cant overcome it. But how should we do it if we become a Christian, we must put off our old self and put on our new self? How can we deal with this struggle? Paul also told us that its only through Jesus Christ that we can be rescued; its only through Jesus Christ that we can be set free. So what a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin. Romans 7:24-25. From the scripture, it told us that we couldnt overcome our short coming, and we couldnt do the good things by ourselves, relying on ourselves. But only relying on Jesus Christ, only through Him, we can be set free. We know this, but how can we rely on Jesus? There are at least several steps in Ephesians 4, it told us how can we put off our old self and put on new self through Jesus Christ. Step 1 is to know Him and truth. You, however, did not come to know Christ that way. Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. Ephesians 4:20-21. This part of scripture told us that the people who have already become a Christian, and heard from Him, and got to know truth through Jesus Christ in Him, we shouldnt live like the Gentiles do. We find out the way is that to know Him and truth, but how can we know Him and truth? There are several ways, first we can read the Bible daily. Bible is our daily bread, when we read Bible, we will know the truth, know what is right and what is wrong. When we read Bible, well know that Holy Sprite will help us, guild us, lead us and give us the power to do the will of Gods will. Also, attend the Sunday service and small groups regularly, like today. Maybe people think that I just read Bible by myself in my family, its enough. But, I say that thats not enough. Please dont stop going to the Sunday service and please attend the Sunday service. You are lucky now in this church, because we dont have enough small groups, this is one of the prayer requirements I want you pray that we can have enough small groups. So I will encourage you to attend the Sunday service, if you have small group, to attend the small group as well. Because during the Sunday service, you will see how powerful and great our God is, you will see how God changes other people in their life. You will communicate with each other. Also reading Christian books and having fellowship with brothers and sisters. Share with each other, build with each other and communicate with each other. So, this is the way that I want to show you very practically that to know Him, hear Him, Jesus Christ is our Lord, and also to know the truth. Step 2, taking actions to put off your old self. You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; Ephesians 4:22. This part of scripture tells us, as a Christian, regarding your formal way of life, we should put off our old self. We should take actions to put off our old self, not just in our mind. For example, today we share this scripture, you said O Lord, I want to live for you, I want to give my life to you. But right after you left the church, you forgot about that. Thats not right. So the second step is taking actions in putting off your old self. I will show you one story. This is very new, I just heard this morning. Actually I prepared another one, but I want to change to this one. This morning, I went to one of the Sunday school classroom, and I just heard a conversation with one of the kids, his mother and Sunday school teacher. They were talking about how God changed this little boy. I think he is maybe 9 or 10 years old. I dont know what they talked about before, but when I arrived in that room, they were talking about a story that how this child changed the other children in his class. Because this kid goes to Sunday school regularly, so he knows about the truth, knows about God, knows that we cant waste food. One day, one of his classmates brought a very big apple, but he didnt want to eat it and threw it. This boy said that, because his classmates family has a lot of money, so he doesnt care about one small apple (actually its a big apple). So when this boy saw this, he felt its not good. So he said to his classmate, Please dont throw that apple, because you are wasting food. His classmate said, Its none of your business, just take care of yourself. The little boy said, I have already taken care of myself, I listen to the teacher very carefully, I finish my homework on time, I love my mom and I dont waste food. His classmate then didnt say anything at first, but then replied, Its my mom who bought this apple, its none of your business. The little boy didnt say anything, just cut his apple into two parts, and gave one part to the other boy. The other boy said, I dont want to eat your apple, it doesnt look good. The little boy said, I know your mom bought the apple for you, I know my apple is not as good as yours. But you know, this apple takes all the farmers hard work, you have to eat it, you have to respect the others hard work. That other boy said nothing, but ate the apple. So this story told us that, take actions to put off your old self, and also bring a good influence to the others. By attending Sunday school, this little boy was changed, also he brought a good example to his classmates. Im not sure if he is here or not, but I want to give thanks to our God and his mom, because his mom takes her child to our church, also thank God that He changed the mothers heart and childs heart. So dear brothers and sisters, I want to encourage you to take actions to put off your old self. You will be changed, also, step-by-step, day by day; this society will be changed by Gods work, by the truth.Step 3, renew your minds and put on your new self. To be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. Ephesians 4:23-24. Sometimes we found that, we can do good things, but maybe our motivation, our attitude is not right. So here, Ephesians told us that not only put off your old self, but renew your minds and put on your new self. to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. Ephesians 4:23-24. Its much more difficult than doing things. God cares about our hearts. So how can we do that? We found out in Galatians 5:25, Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. This scripture told us that only by helping through the Holy Spirit, our mind can be renewed. So we cant renew our mind [by ourselves]. Maybe we can pretend to be friendly to other people, but we couldnt change our mind, our attitude and our motivation. But here, the Bible told us that to be made new in attitude of your minds. So dear brothers and sisters, the Holy Spirit will help us to evaluate what we have done, and give us the motivation. Also, the Holy Spirit will guide us to make the right decision when we face our own struggles.I want to share another story with you which happened in my life. Several weeks ago, one of the brothers from Chinese fellowship asked my husband Li to take them to Retreat in our mini bus. But the same day, we needed someone to check out the accommodation for the English Fellowship Retreat. One the same day, I have to preach and attend one of the weddings. So in my mind, I didnt want him to help them, because I want him to help the English Fellowship to check out. However, in the end, he decided to help them. At 8:00pm, the night before the Retreat, the mini bus broke down. It was also raining outside. Because it was too late for the mini bus to be repaired, I was glad, because now he can help me to do what I wanted him to do in the English Fellowship. I thought this is Gods plan too. But Li decided to repair the mini bus by himself in the heavy rain, and I have to hold umbrella an for him. After one hour, he was very wet and couldnt repair the bus. I told him to call them and say that we tried our best but we couldnt help them. Just let them know. But he didnt do that and kept trying to repair it. He said, I will try again. Another hour flew away. Do you know what happened? It worked, its a miracle. Actually this mini bus broke down several days later, but on that day it worked. He is not a repair man. But after this, the Holy Spirit let me realize that I was wrong. Because I can find someone to do the English Fellowship check out, but that Fellowship couldnt find someone to bring them to go on the retreat. Then, God taught me that I had been selfish. Then I held my husbands hands, and pray and said to God, Im sorry, please forgive me, and please protect my husband and people who are in the car. So dear brothers and sisters, I want to share my weakness to you, and let you know that even I stand here, I say loudly please put off your old self and put on your new self, also in myself, I still have weakness, I need to keep putting off my old self and putting on my new self. May God bless all of us, and may God let us know how we can put off our old self and put on our new self in our daily life. Ephesians 4:23-32 is talking about how we can put off our old self and put on our new selfbasically and practically. Because of the time limit, I will give you one little home work, please read this part of Bible, and put off your old self and put on your new self. Lets pray, Heavenly father, I thank you so much for today you teaching us and guild us, and you let us know the truth, which Jesus Christ told us. God please let us realize that we are so weak, but the Holy Spirit will help us. We cant rely on ourselves, but we can rely on you. We can rely on you to do anything you want us to do. Let us put off our old self and put on our new self in our daily life. Let us keep our hearts and minds completely open to God, guide our hearts, always speak truthfully. In our anger do not sin, do not let the sun go down while we are still angry. Deal with the anger before sleep. Do not steal, but work hard. Share with others, let us be helpful, encouraging to others and help them. Let us be kind, let us be full of compassion. Let us always forgive one another. Let us love one another, build each other. I pray in Jesus name. Amen!"

Dear Jesus, please help us be more and more like you so when people see us, they see you in us. I pray for the whole service today. May your Holy Spirit fill this place and our hearts. Lord, I also pray for all the volunteers who are serving this morning. Please bless them because of their faithfulness. Jesus, I lift up the preacher before you., Please speak to our hearts through her sermon. May your Name be glorified this morning.  In Jesus Name, Amen.Preacher: Rachel He Good morning dear brothers and sisters, would you please join me with a short prayer:Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for gathering us here to worship you and learn your words. God, we ask you please send your Holy Spirit to work in our hearts and help us understand your words. Help us live out your words in our daily life. God, I want to deliver myself, all my brothers and sisters here and the rest of our time of today in your hands. Please be with us. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.Dear brothers and sisters, today, we are going to focus on the book of Ephesians Chapter 5:3-20. We know the letter to Ephesians is the most contemporary book in the Bible. Apart from a few terms and the subject of slavery, this letter could have been written to a modern church, because it shows us who we are without Christ and who we become with Christ. In this Scripture, Paul is using the contrasts between darkness and light, deception and truth, lack of fruit and fruit, and hidden and revealed. When he is speaking of the old life without Christ as compared to the new life in Christ, Paul tries to tell all Christians how we can live out a holy life in this world. The believer is called to be a lightFirst, I want to say, the believer is called to be a light. Jesus is the light of the world and we are the light of the world. We all know the Book of Ephesians is a letter that Paul wrote to the church in Ephesus. Ephesus was a very modern city and the home to the temple of Artemis who was regarded as the fertility goddess. So, sexual sins and orgies were regularly associated with her worship. There was a certain legitimacy given to this shtheort of immoral behavior.  Jesus is the light of the worldPaul was asking the believers to not follow the bad examples around them and not to be influenced by their circumstances, and also this Scripture reminds us when Jesus was still in the world, and he called himself as the light of the world. John 8:12 I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. We know usually when Jesus teaches, he always uses the things that we are familiar with. When the room is dark, you may think it is very clean. But then the light is on, you will find there are a lot of dusts in the room.We are the light of the worldBefore we get to know Jesus, maybe we think we are good people or we are even perfect. But after we get to know Jesus, we find that we are not perfect and even are not good. We are sinners and we need the light, because Jesus is the light of life. He changes our lives. Ephesians 5: 8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.We are light in the Lord. This is a call that comes from God. He calls us to live as children of light. Before we came to Him, we were dead in our trespasses and sins. And we were the children of Satan. Whereas we think we are light, we are content to be darkness. But then something happened, because Jesus came to us to save us. So we are in Christ, we are now light. We who were once children of darkness have become children of light. 1 John 1:5-7 This is the message we have heard from Him and declare to you: God is light;In Him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with Him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth. But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin. Each of us has been called to live a different life from those who are still grouping in darkness and sins. We have the responsibility to show up in the world by living a contrast way of life and by showing that Christ really does make a difference in how we live in our daily lives. We can be the light in the dark corners of the world. And be a positive influence on those who are still living in the darkness. Of course, it does not happen overnight. Actually it is a process as we seek to live out our lives each day. But we should remember, Jesus is the light of the world and we are called to be light of the world.  Live as Children of LightJust like what we said, we know we should be the light of the world. But what should we do to live as children of light? Here we will look at the deeds that characterize those who are living in the light. A. Renewing of your words. Paul says in Ephesians 5:3-4, But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for Gods holy people. Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. Here we can see some commands to avoid sins of tongue.1) Avoid sexual immorality, impurity and greed,2) Avoid obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking (silly talk)Because there are not proper for Gods people. But, what are proper for Gods people?1) Not only avoid sins of the tongue but we are to be thankful 2) We are to honor God with our speech, Verse 4.We have always heard that our actions must match with who we are and what we believe. In fact, our words are as important as our actions, because words lead to actions. We wouldnt use bad languages when we are standing in Gods presence, because it is not fitting with our identity and it is not proper for Gods people. Here God is not condemning humor but foolishness.   I remember once I had a meeting with one of the Christian organizations. Before I went there, I thought all the people who would be attending the meeting shall be Christians. But when I arrived, I found some people were quarreling with each other. They said many bad words and bad things. So I thought they were not Christians. But when the meeting started, they all introduced themselves as Christians. At that time, I felt very hurt by them. And it reminds me of how I can use my tongue wisely. How can we say words that please God and help people not hurt others? And also it makes me think about what it would be like to feel ourselves through the light of Gods standards before we open our mouth. I dont know if you have ever had this kind of experience of having a conversation with someone and then afterwards, you feel it is a waste of time. And the conversation was meaningless, maybe its Kan da shan, or something else. For Christians, we are encouraged to teach and admonish and think Gods words and to use our tongues wisely, instead of being obscene and silly talk. Colossians 3:16-17 Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly, as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God. B, Renewing of your mind. Verses 8 to 10 tell us that Live as children of light, for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth, and find out what pleases the Lord. What Paul means is that those who live as children of light will continuingly try to figure out what the will of God is in every situation, so that we could please Him. Here we can see some commands to avoid shameful sins a, It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. b, Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. What is proper for Gods people?a, The fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteous and truth,(Verse 9)b, Trying to learn what is pleasing to God.(Verse10) So the things we should think to be goodness, righteous and truth Paul told us to find out what pleases the Lord in verse 10. And also we said the same thing in verse 17Do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. In Matthew 12:35the good man brings good things out of the good stored up in Him and the evil man brings evil things out of evil stored up in him. Maybe you will say I have a hard time to be in goodness, righteousness and truth, I dont know what will please the Lord. I dont know what the Gods will is. First, if you want to have a fruit of goodness, righteousness, and truth, the way to do is to get close to the Light, and spend time next to the Light. Because Jesus is goodness, He is the righteousness and truth, and thats why it is very important for you to spend personal time with God in prayer and Bible study every day. And thats why its very important for you to come to church to worship Him and have fellowship with others. What we are, how we act and how we speak, all of these have to do our relationship with God. Proverbs 4:23 Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life. What is in our heart is very important. If you get close to Jesus and let Him be the Lord in your heart, you will be able to shine in your life.   Second, study His word and ask if it will please God.  Psalm 119:105 Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.How do we find out what is Gods plan and Gods will? The way to learn is to be a student to Gods words. Read it, ask questions of it and apply it in the very situation in your life. Then, you will see the light and be able to shine in your life. I think we can all imagine how many bad situations you and I could have avoided? In our life, if we only would have had the sins, we just ask the simple question Is this action, attitude or behavior pleasing to God? Yes, we need to ask this question constantly. In every decision, in every behavior, in every attitude, ask ourselves: Does this behavior please you, God? Does this attitude presently please you God? Does this experience I am considering please you God? Sometimes, the answer is no because we want to please ourselves. We want our actions to please others not God. David has the right attitude in: Psalm19:14 May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer. David is saying I dont want to speak words from my mouth, if it doesnt please you, O Lord. It even goes further than that. He says I dont even want myself if the meditation of my heart not to please you. He wants to prove with his life that he was living to please the Lord. Brothers and sisters, how can the Bible help us with our decisions and our situations? Maybe the Bible didnt tell you everything in details, but there is a principle to help you. The principle is that to prove every thought, every action and every word to the test, what will the Lord think about it? C, Renewing of your action. a, Commands to avoid shameful actions. Paul told us Exposure instead of Participation There are many comments on lifestyles or situations in our society, like drunkenness, marriage co-habitation (live together without getting married)., Divorce is becoming easier and easier, and even more and more college students lovers are choosing to live together out of campus. Whats your opinion about this? Do you agree or disagree? Do you care about what the Bible teaches or it doesnt matter? We need to think about it. Psalm1:1-6 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.Our light will expose darkness and help others. The words expose means not to just make known but also to reprove, to correct, to point something out to someone. Paul goes on to think about the impact of dominant culture on our lives. Maybe you feel hard to maintain your integrity in todays society, or maybe you look around and find that nothing has really changed in 2000 yet, but Paul suggest that to be the light in this world, do not participate in any shameful action, but rather reprove such people; for because of such things, Gods wrath comes on those who are disobedient, therefore, do not be partners with them. Whats proper for Gods people? Paul told us to seek the life in the Spirit. The commend be very careful, then how you live explained by 3 not but contrasts here: a. not as unwise, but as wise;b. not foolish, but understanding what the Lords will is; c. not drunk, but filled it with Spirit. Because drunkenness is involved in a lot of control of our actions, but the work of the Spirit is to give us control over our actions in a Godly way.Matthew 5: 16 Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in Heaven.  If we are Gods really loved dear children, we need to act like it. Put off our old way of life and put on the new life. Be wise in the way we live, be wise in the way we use our time, be wise in the way we think and be wise in the way we use our words and tune. Always ask the same question: Will this please the Lord? 3. A wake-up call for believers ----- turns on your light. I think this Scripture is also a wake-up call for Christians who are in a spiritual slumber. We need to wake up and not to be sleepy Christians any more. Sometimes, we have no problem shining brightly on Sunday mornings, but we have a problem to keep the light on during the rest of the week. However, if we are pursuing right standing with God and others, well live the same on Monday morning as we have lived on Sunday in the church, and people will see it. We shall avoid being a beam light. Jesus says: No one lights a lamp and put it under a bushel (Matthew 5:15).Several years ago, I got to know a sister; she was just a new believer at that time, while I met her and ask her: How did you feel after you became a Christian? And she said, I feel theres no freedom, compared with the lifestyle I had when I was not a Christian. So I was so surprised and I asked her why. She said, Before I became a Christian, I was the NO.1 in my family. My husband and my kids all listened to me, especially when we quarreled with each other; I was always the stronger one. But since I have been a Christian, the Bible and all preachers all say as a Christian, I should be gentle and humble. After that, when we quarreled with each other, I dont know what should I say, so they didnt listen to me anymore. So later I decided when we quarreled with each other, I would choose not to think about Christ, and I would choose to forget Im a Christian. Afterwards, I could confess my sins.  So she said it makes me feel theres no freedom. Maybe it sounds funny, but it is true. Sometimes we would like to turn on our light, when we think its OK; but sometimes we will turn it off, especially when the things dont fit what we think, we do things just like non-believers. Ephesians 5:14 Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead and Christ will shine on you.In Romans, Paul said the same thing. Romans 13: 11-14 And do this understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the light is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. Rather, clothes yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.  I still remember theres a parable that Jesus told us about the ten virgins. The kingdom of Heaven is just like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were wise and five of them were foolish. The foolish ones took their lamps but they didnt take oil with them; the wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom took a long time to come, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. When the bridegroom came, the foolish virgins lamps were going out and they were not ready for the banquet, and the door was shut. Jesus said therefore, keep watching because you do not know the day or the hour. We need to turn on our light from today, renewing our words, minds and actions, to be aware of time and become spiritually awake.Dear brothers and sisters, leaving the light on require four acts: a, Live continually in the Lord, be aware of Him, directed by Him and discern what is pleasing to Him; b, Refuse to partner with or participate in sexual sin, greed, inappropriate language, and every form of disobedience; c, Perform positive actions, doing good, righteousness and truth; d, Expose the darkness for what it is. Once I heard a pastor said that the church is the company that produces the light and salt. Today I want to say the same that Haidian Church is the company of salt and light. And I want to tell all of you, you are the light to this world, you are the light of the world. Tell each other, tell your neighbor you are the light of the world, you are the light to this world. Let us encourage each other to live as children as light, to turn on our life, and brighten the corner where you are. Amen.  PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 6"

We know that God, you built this church and made it grow by yourself. God, thank you for revealing to us that you lead people to know you, you make people grow, and lead them to become more and more mature. God, thank you so much for your love for each of us, thank you so much for choosing us, and for your willingness to die for each of us. Today we get together to give thanks to you, and we want to praise you and worship you from our deep heart. Lord, I want to lift up all of the brothers and sisters in your hands. We know you are the God of this church, and also of each of us, you are our Heavenly Father. You will be with us, and you will reveal yourself to us, you will take care of us. Lord, we want to pray today all of us can be touched by your words, and experience your presence. I lift up all the people who are serving here in your hands, and also your servant Pastor Wu, and please speak to us through him, and please encourage and teach us through him. I lift up this service in your hands, please be with us, we pray in Jesus name. Amen.Well, my lips shout for joy to You the Most High! I think that is the reason we come to church. We come to church and we shout for joy, because He loves us! Our Heavenly Father loves us. Our Lord Jesus loves us so much that He was sacrificed, He was betrayed and He was crucified on the cross for us. So we come to church to open our mouth to shout with our lips for joy to the Most High because He is the only One worthy for us to do that. So I love that. Thank you so much Colleen, also to your helper Rick. I do not agree with you Colleen when you were saying sometime youre in love with Rick and sometimes you are not. But from what I have experienced, Ricks always in love with you. Let us come back to Ephesians 6:4:Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. And brothers and sisters, today is the third day of June, two days before, there was a very important festival, which has taken place on the first day of June, the day for the Children, the Childrens Day. And today is also two weeks before Fathers Day. So Fathers Day comes in two weeks, so brothers and sisters today I like to focus my understanding on some of the teachings. In Ephesians, I like to focus on how to be a good father, a godly father, a father that our Lord Jesus Christ wants our brothers to be. Yesterday on Saturday, my wife and I together with thirty students from Yanjing Seminary went to Olympic Forest Park. Students wanted to have some time to pray to praise the Lord with their teacher before summer holiday starts, so I was invited as well as my wife and all of us went to the Olympic Forest Park. We sat on the grass under the tree and enjoyed the weather and the time there. We prayed and sang a few songs; we played some games, and we had a wonderful time. While I was there, I saw a lot of parents playing games with their children. A lot of fathers were playing frisbees with their children, or fathers were riding bicycles alongside their children, and the husbands were playing badminton with their wives. That really touched my heart because when I was seeing what was happening there, I questioned myself and meanwhile I also questioned fathers there who were playing with their children and wives: Do they come to spend some time with their wives and children just on holidays? Have they spent enough time with their children and wives as Jesus as the Bible has taught us to do? And I also questioned myself: have I been a good husband to my wife, a good father to my daughter? Looking back to my own life, I was very regretful as a father. You know I have not spent much time with my daughter before she left home for college. Some of my hairs had turned grey before I spent enough time to be with my wife; before my wife blamed me. I asked myself: have I been a good husband to my wife? Have I been a good father to my daughter? I also asked the same question to those who were playing games with their children, and riding bicycles in the park alongside their children: Have they been spending enough time with their families and with their household as Jesus has taught us to be? Then the question comes to how to be a good husband, a good father by Jesus' standard? And what kind of husband you should be? To meet the standard set up before us by the teaching from the Bible and also by Jesus.  Let me read Ephesians 5:22-24 and I warn our brothers and husbands here: when I am reading this part of Bible, do not feel complacent in your heart, do not feel so proud in your heart. The Bible tells us: Ephesians 5:22-24 Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the heard of the church, His body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.  Brothers and husbands, let me ask you: were you feeling complacent and proud to be husbands, saying my wife should submit to me as the Lord teaches us? Let me warn you again that do not forget this part of the Bible also tells us the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church. Then, the question comes: How is Jesus the head of the church? In three aspects, the Bible tells us that we can be a good husband to our wife and a good father to our children.First of all, Jesus wants us to sacrifice. You want to be a good husband and father? You need to sacrifice as Jesus sacrificed for us so that we can be saved. Jesus was the head, and is still the head of church, not because of His authority, not because of His divine prerogative, but because He made sacrifice for the church which is the bride of the bridegroom. Jesus is the head of church, not because of His authority or His divine prerogative, but because He was willing to lay down His life and pay back the debt, and to be crucified on the cross, so that we can have hope to be saved. That is the reason why He can be the head of church, a good husband of church, and a good bridegroom of the bride, because He was crucified, sacrificed and was suffering. So brothers and sisters, you can tell that how you can be a good husband and a good father to your wife and children. The answer is to make sacrifice for your wife and children, make a real sacrifice, make a painful sacrifice, make a sacrifice that nobody can do for you on your behalf. Bible in Matthew 26:36-37 tells us that Jesus went with His disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and He said to them: Sit here while I go over there and pray. He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with Him. He began to be sorrowful and troubled because He knew the death He would be facing was painful. Then He said to them: My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watching with me. Going a little farther, He fell with His face to the ground and prayed: My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me, may this death of mine be taken away; may this suffer of mine be taken away; may this painful death be taken away from me. Yet, as the husband to the church, as the bridegroom to the bride, as the father to the children who are the children of God, not as I will, but as you will. May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven! Brothers and sisters, can you make a sacrifice that nobody can do on your behalf or in you stead, for your family? If you can do that, you can be a good husband, thats the husband that your wife wants you to be; thats the father that your children want you to be--to make a sacrifice for the household, to make a sacrifice for the family. Last month, I was away, you may have noticed. I was away for almost a month from Haidian church; I was taking a course of my doctoral ministry study, and flew to the seminary in Los Angeles. After finishing this course, I did a little bit more travelling from one state to another. When I was landing at airport in Minneapolis, I was met by a pastor who was so kind taking me to his home. As we were driving close to his home, I noticed the neighborhoods in term of construction, in term of environment and in term of atmosphere, were so bad. The roof, especially some tiles on top of the house, fell down; it was in a very bad condition. When I was walking into the pastors home, he warned me not to sit in the chair because one of the chair legs might break; then he warned me again that I can sit on the chair, but not to lean my back on it, because it might fall down. Well, I could not help asking myself, Am I in the United States? So many American homes I have visited are gorgeous and beautiful. Some expensive houses have swimming pool in the back. How great the houses are, but this just does not look like a house in America. So I shared my feeling with the pastor and asked why: You do not have money to buy a decent house? He told me that eight years ago, the pastor of that church, John Piper, urged the staff of the church to move from their cozy comfortable homes to the neighborhoods where there were troubles with prostitution, drugs and guns. And John Piper urged the staff to move from their comfortable homes into those neighborhoods where they can be the light and salt, so that the glory of the Lord can be seen, that peoples lives can really be changed. So they moved into the neighborhoods, and that is why they live in such a humble house. The decision of moving from a good house into this humble one was very hard to make for this father, because his two sons were too young to be exposed to such a bad neighborhood, so he was puzzled on the way home. After dinner, he lay down his bowl and dish, starting to talk with his two sons and his wife about the decision that the church wanted the staff to make. And the two sons remark strengthened and encouraged the pastor to follow the decision and move into the harsh house, the neighborhood. And two sons said this: Father, youve been sacrificing as Jesus did for us for so many years, lets sacrifice one more time, that you can be like Jesus, and we can be proud of you as our father who shines the glory of the Lord. So they moved into that house and the night they moved into the house, they heard the gun shot, the father and two children fell onto the floor with the father spreading his arms to protect the two little kids. You can tell how bad the condition is, but our Lord sacrificed that way for you, for us. So brothers and husbands, our Lord wants you to be that kind of husband and father to be faithful to the Lord to protect your children and also to sacrifice for your family. Jesus also wants us to be faithful, if you want to be a good husband to your wife, a good father to your children, youll get to be faithful, because the Bible in II Timothy 2:13  tells us: If we are faithless, He will remain faithful. We may not love our Lord, and that is not going to diminish the love of God. We may not love the Lord, but it does not mean the love of our Lord will come down only this much. The love of our Lord for us will remain forever and remain the same, because our Lord is love. He also wants husbands and fathers to be the love which never changes forever, because our Lord is faithful. He never changes. As I was continuing to travel, I met another pastor whos not only a pastor of a church, but also a chaplain for the Senate of State of Ohio. He was so proud to be able to preach to those so-called significant people who can influence the society. But one day, he was reproached by somebody who was working for the Senate. That person approached him and said: You see, my pastor, in so many states, a law has been passed that from now on, for the equality of different religions, or people from different cultural backgrounds, you are not supposed to preach in the name of Jesus anymore. If you continue to do that, we might not ask you to come back. He was so puzzled, because as a Christian, you got to preach and pray in the name of the Lord. No other names can succeed the name of Jesus, and no other names should be said at the end of the prayer instead of the name of Christ Jesus. He was puzzled, because he wanted to come back to continue to preach to those senators who are important people that they can be a positive influence to the society. He shared his feeling with his wife and kids and with his church. His wife and kids came up with a solution, but he was not sure he could get the way with this. He told the person who was asking him not to preach in the name of Jesus: Ok, I will come back to do what you want me to do. so he went back to the chapel of the senate, the parliament. As he was preaching one day, people with hearts sat down in the audience; they were so nervous and actually frightened that he might not pray in the name of the Lord. Then he started to pray: Lord, thank you for this great time that I spend with them, that they can be the good light and salt and then he ended up his prayer by saying, Lord, I pray all of these in the name of the Creator of the universe and the Father full of love; I pray also in the name of Christ who came down from Heaven to be crucified for us that we can be saved; I pray also in the name of the Holy Spirit that prays for us on the right side of our Heavenly Father; I pray in the name of the triumphant God. At the end of his prayer, many senators came to the front of the church to meet him, and the person who asked him not to pray in the name of the Lord also came, saying, Well, thats the best prayer I have heard, but would you please next time just pray in the name of Jesus, because the prayer would be simpler? You see our faithfulness will change the world! Brothers and sisters, I Peter 3: 7 also tells us, Husbands, in the same way, be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers. Let us be faithful. Never compromise the teaching of the Lord for us, that we can be a good father and husband. Bible also tells us in Matthew 20:28, Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. Not to be served but to serve, you husbands and fathers, you marry into a family not to be served but to seek the opportunity to serve and glorify the Lord, the glory of the Kingdom of God; you marry into a family to serve so that you can be a good example as Jesus that all the household can come to the presence of the Lord. You come to serve, you do not to come to be served.John 1:14-16, the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. What does it mean? The meaning is that our Lord, 24 hours a day, is dwelling among us, listening to our prayers, protecting us, and safeguarding us as we work in this world, as we struggle, and as we fight spiritual battles; He is with us 24 hours a day, He never leaves. So you husbands, you marry into a family, a marriage, to seek the opportunity to serve. It is not when you want to serve so you serve, or when you have time to serve so you serve, but whenever possible, you have to serve, you must serve for 24 hours a day, no time to rest. Some time ago I heard a song entitled, In Love with A Person Who Does Not Come Home. The lyrics go like this: Be in love with a person who does not come home, that I have to wait for the door to open which never opened. Once the door opened, that person walked in, I was so frightened by the capricious expression in his eyes; I was so frightened by his tightly shut mouth, because he never communicated. Well, I have to give up, because theres no reason for me to press on for promises, there is no reason to me to press for answers. Brothers and fathers, do you want to be a person who never comes home to your wife, or you want to be a father/husband like Jesus to His church, who makes sacrifice, has been faithful, and comes to serve? Im sure you already have the answer. May God bless you and your family. Amen. PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 1"

May you fill their hearts and work in their hearts, may your Holy Spirit unify each of us here, and may all of us know you as our MIP in our lives. We pray in Jesus name, amen.At first I want to share a testimony that I just experienced recently. I oversee the college ministry at Haidian Church. Our college fellowship had a wonderful retreat last weekend. The first night in the retreat, we had a worship time, and sang a song called Love You, All My Life. Several words of this song touched me a lot. It says, Love you, all my life; worship you, all my life; glorify you, all my life; sacrifice, all my life; follow you, all my life. When we sang these verses, I stopped to think, and prayed to God, Lord, may these words become my prayer to you, I want to become this kind of person, and I want to use all my life to love you only! Of course there are other people in our lives, so how can I say that God is the one I love the most; on the stage of life, God is at the center. I wish I can live with Him only, live for Him. But how can I say that God is at the center with other people around us. It is like that God is a VIP, except that He is the MIP just like the topic (suggests) God as the MIP. Most of you have already heard of the word VIP, but do you know the meaning of MIP? Can you guess what it means? (answering from the congregation) I heard the right answer; it means Most Important Person. We know when a VIP shows up to our work, we will, of course, be very careful to do everything very well to make the VIP feel welcomed. It is also (the case) when the MIP God shows up. And of course, God is always with us. Therefore, while there are many people around us, we always keep in our mind that in our lives, God is the MIP, and we live to please Him.I know many of you here are working in different kinds of jobs, and most of the rest of you are preparing to work in the near future. Last February, we did a sermon series which was called At Work. I do not know how many of you still remember this series. I will mention today what we have learnt in that series. Today we will talk about our commitment and attitude at work. First, lets look at the background of the text that we just read from Ephesians 6:5-9. Background of the ScriptureWe know the book of Ephesians was written by Apostle Paul. When Paul wrote Ephesians, he was writing in the context of Greco-Roman world in the first century. In that society, slavery was so much a part of life that hardly anyone thought it might be wrong. A third of the people in Greece and Rome were slaves. Their lifes situation depended on their owners. There was no doubt that for many of them, their lives were very harsh and cruel. So the Bible here in Ephesians is speaking about the relationship between masters and slaves, and how to be a good master or slave. Modern Application of the ScriptureA modern application of it is in the area of work, and the relationship between employees and employers. First, lets see how one can be a good slave in this chapter, what Paul has already told us? How can one be a good slave? There are two points for how one can be a good salve. Number one is that a slave must obey his master with respect, fear and sincerity of heart; the other is that a slave should serve his master wholeheartedly. How can a slave serve wholeheartedly? Paul continued to say that a slave should serve as if he is serving the Lord, but not men. Next, Paul addressed to those who were masters. What are the masters commanded to do? The Bible says that masters should treat slaves in the same way as the slaves are to obey their masters with respect, fear and sincerity of heart. God is the master of both slaves and earthly masters; He is not pleased that human masters are in the higher place than the slaves, so He said that master and slave are all equal before Christ. They are all the servants of Christ.We no longer have slavery in our society, but the commands to masters and slaves are still important for us, because we can apply these principles in our workplace today. Most of us, like I just said, need to work after you graduate from school. Maybe some of you are working now, some will graduate in July, in the near future, and you want to find a good job, you need to go to work, to different careers. So, most of us are still employees. But as Christian employees, we want to be godly employees. Maybe some of you here are employers, running your own business; you also want to be a godly employer. So today we will focus on how to be a godly employee and employer in your workplace. Heart First, and then ActionsMany times when we hear the words respect, fear and sincerity of heart, we think of behaviors that can be seen from the outside. These are behaviors that can be learned with focus and efforts. My focus today is not only on the visible behaviors, but on the motivation behind the behaviors. What motivate a person to behave with respect, fear and sincerity of heart? This is what we are going to talk about at this sermon. What we see here is that how we relate to God will affect how we relate to other people. However, even more importantly, how we relate to God says who we become. Ultimately, out of love, God is concerned about saving us to be more like His image. It is a small choice to make, either to respect God or not, save us into more like His image or not. God desires our heart and our will to be transformed. Dear brothers and sisters, and friends, God desires our heart and our will to be transformed by Him. Then naturally, from this heart transformation that can affect our action, our action can be changed by this heart transformation. If we learn to serve God and obey Him, we will know how to be a good employee or employer at work. If our motivation is to please God and love Him, our attitude will be one of respect, fear and sincerity of heart. So today we will focus on heart transformation and committing our work to God, rather than just living out external behaviors. 1. We are the servants of GodFrom these verses in Ephesians chapter 6, we can know some principles that can help change our thinking about work, and thereby transform our heart and attitude at work. First, we should know the first principle is that we are the servants of God. Who are we really (working for)? What motivate us? Who do we seek to please? The most important application of this chapter and these verses is the realization that we are slaves of God, not other people. Dear brothers and sisters, have you really understood what it means to be slaves of Christ? The Bible gives us a picture that we are like clay, a lump of mud, and God is like a potter, the person who shapes the clay. So we see that in the PowerPoint slide. Let me ask you, what can clay do? Can it dance by itself? Do you think it can dance by itself? Yes or no? No. Can it speak? No. Can it sing? No. Can it become a cup by itself? No. So we all know the answer. All clay can really do is to wait to be molded by the potter. And that is Gods desire for us, to allow Him to mold us into His image. Furthermore, we need to stay there to remain in the loving potters hands, for Him to continue to shape us and use us how He pleases. We should remember we need to remain in the loving potters hands to let Him continue to shape us and use how He pleases. The parable of the potter and clay (Jeremiah 18:1-11) tells us that we are in Gods hand. But what does that mean? Dear brothers and sisters, I want to ask you, Do you work by Gods power? With God as our potter, do you work with your own strength and wisdom? What is your answer? You may be asking yourself, How do I work by Gods power? Can I just do nothing and sit on the couch and God will make things clean and make things happen? No, of course, not. We need to take our responsibilities to be His tool. So how can I do work by Gods power? How can we achieve that balance? A good place to begin is by asking that question, Is this Gods strength or mine? Consider it carefully, particularly consider the outcome, the result. Do you care about your work because of self-motivation? Or (is it) because God is the Most Important Person (MIP) at your work? What do you care? I myself still struggle with this question. I keep thinking and asking myself, Am I working by Gods power or by my own strength? I do not have it all figured out. But it is good for me to think that I need to keep trying to strike a balance between working hard and resting in the loving hands of the potter. So as the servants of Christ, the first principle is that we should remember three points. 1.1. God is with you when you workNumber one is God is with you when you work. God is with me when I work. God is with us when we work. You do not do anything alone. You do not do your work by yourself. God is with you. Dear brothers and sisters, sometimes, in the worlds view, in the company, maybe your boss gives you some assignment and let you do it by yourself. But in Gods eyes, He will not leave you to do your work alone. He is with you every moment. Every breath He is with you. So when you face some difficulties in your work, however large or small, you can pray to our God, and ask for His help, His wisdom and His guidance. According to Palms 46, verse 1, it says, God is our refuge and our strength, and our present help in times of trouble.So dear brothers and sisters, we should be eager to live WITH Him, not only live for Him. We should desire to live with our God. We should remember that Christ and I do everything together. Christ and you do everything together. You do not do anything alone. God is with you. The name of JESUS means God is with us. So, please remember we are in Gods hands. He is with us. When you face some difficulties, you are not alone. You have a helper and a refuge. You have God with you and He never leaves you alone. He desires to be with you. This is our blessings, our gift from God. 1.2. Servant of God does not only refer to the pastorsNumber two, the servant of God does not only refer to the pastors. It includes everyone. Anyone can be called the servant of Christ, no matter what kind of job you have. If you are a Christian, you are the servant of God. Some people may think that only pastors could be called the servants of God. Why? Because pastors deliver Gods words to others, because pastors can shepherd the sheep God has chosen. Pastors work at church and they have a calling from God. Their jobs are holy and they can be called the servants of God. I am not. I do not work at a church. I work in the companies and my work belongs to the world. My work is not holy. This kind of thinking is not right. Everything we do in the world directly encounters Jesus Christ. Perhaps you wonder, How can that be? I work in the companies, in the business, not at a church. No matter what kind of job you are doing now, as a Christian, you are the servant of God; and your job is holy in Gods sight. You are the servants of God and you can glorify Gods name through your work. Whatever we do, even little action and attitude matters. Dear brothers and sisters, every little action and attitude matters, it matters in Gods eyes. Please cherish the work you have. If you are a teacher, teach to Gods glory. If you are a cleaner, clean to Gods glory. If you are a designer, design to Gods glory. He gives you gifts and abilities that you use for work and when you work hard, you are serving the Lord in heaven. How is it different when you remember you are the servant of God? The Bible says in Ephesians, if you think you are the servant of Christ, you will obey your master, you will respect him and serve him with sincerity of heart. You will not be lazy at your work. If you are the master, you will not threaten your servants. No matter (it is for) masters or slaves, they are all equal before Christ. You will do everything with all your heart, because you know you are serving the Lord, not men. Because you know your boss is not the one on earth but Christ, the one who loves you and gives Himself to redeem you. If we really understand His amazing love, we will seek to please Him and love Him in return at our work. I remember a sister who shared a story with me. When she entered into a company, she could use all the office supplies, like pens or paper. And she said that some workers at that company may take some items home with them. When she realized that she was the servant of God, she only used the supplies at office, instead of taking them home. Because she knew that as a servant of God, she did what was right to serve and love God back. This is just a very simple and small example. But this can encourage us. Like I just said, even little actions and things matter to God. Even little things you do matter to God.1.3. God is the boss and master and I am the stewardNumber three, God is the boss and master and I am the steward. You may not be familiar with the English name, but the Chinese is Guanjia (). As employees in a company, we know that God is the real employer. Those who are employers also need to know that they are only stewards, and God is the boss of all. Everything I have belongs to God, not to me. It helps us relax at our work, because we are doing everything for Him. So we shall relax and be generous with our possessions as ultimately all belong to the one who sits high in heaven, not to me. I do not need to burden myself by worrying about those things. I only need to give the burden to Gods hand and let Him solve all the problems. God shows me in my life that He is the boss and He is the head of my body. How can I surrender my life? This is what I have been learning. As I said in the beginning, I am a pastor, I serve at a church and this is my job. My job responsibility is to oversee the college ministry. I read a book called Forgotten God by Francis Chan. The author said in this book that some American churches have wonderful worship bands and excellent preachers, and they would attract many people to attend the services, yet without experiencing the presence of the Holy Spirit. When I heard these words, they shocked me and made me rethink about my ministry at Haidian Church. I do not need the burden of worrying about things. What I have to do is to give all the burdens into Gods hands, and let Him solve all the problems. God tells me that in my life, He is the boss, He is the head of my body. How can I surrender my life? This is what I have been learning. As I have said in the beginning, I am a pastor and I serve at a church, this is my job. My job responsibility is to oversee the college ministry.So I ask myself, if many college students come to attend Thursday nights services, is it because of the Holy Spirits work? Or is it because we use our own strength and wisdom to attract them to attend? Is it because we have a lot of good plans to attract them to attend? Who is the head and master of the college fellowship? Is it really God? How often do we pray for our different activities? How often do we rely on God, on the Holy Spirit for every step of the development of the college fellowship? I keep on asking myself. And this is the question that we need to constantly ask ourselves and bring it prayerfully before Christ. So we know, the first principle, we are the servants of God. And there are three points to this. First, God is with us when we work. Second, the servants of God do not only refer to pastors, but they include all the Christians. The third is God is our boss at work, and we are the steward.Now, lets think who is the audience of our work, is it your earthly master? Is it your parents? Is it your co-workers? Is it your friends? Of course, they are there. But they are not the most important person. So can you tell me who the MIP should be? (Can you speak it loudly?) Who is the MIP at your work? (GOD!)2. God is the MIP at our workGod! So God is the MIP at our work. This is the second principle of how to be a godly employee or employer. God is there when you are working. This motivates us to be best because He is the best one in the world. This motivates us to love our customers and boss because He is looking at us, because He is watching over us. So some workers are lazy, and they tell lies. But Christian servants, Christian employees or employers cannot do things like that. Because God our heavenly Father is always watching over us. He is not only watching over us, but in the meantime, encouraging us to do what is right and pleasing to Him. Even though our earthly master is not with us when we work, but we know that God is there, and God is here, He is watching, so we should work hard. We should tell truth at our work. For example, if a teacher teaches as though he or she does it for Christ. He or she does this wholeheartedly, he or she will not think it just as a job, but teaches as to Christ. He (or she) will love their students, trying their best to teach well. So dear brothers and sisters, please, I plead to you, remember that no matter what you do, do it as to Christ. No matter what you do, do it as to Christ. Do it as to God, because, every moment, God is looking at us. So the fact that God is the most important person at our work may not be a new teaching for some of you here. You may have known this for a long time. But dear brothers and sisters, how often do you just work for God, and remember that God is the MIP to watch what you have done at your workplace? For some of you here, it may be a new teaching. You may not know that God is always with us even at your work, but I want to encourage you to keep on thinking about this truth during the following weeks and make your work time different.Here is the commitment to put God as the MIP at our work and in our lives. Christian Employees Commitment:As a Christian employee, I am the servant of Christ. I will obey my boss with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart. I will work wholeheartedly. I will work diligently to provide for the needs of my family. I am always in Gods hand at my work. Christ and I work together. God is the boss and I am the steward at my work. God is the MIP at my work. I will seek to honor God, obey His word and do His will at my work.Christian Employers Commitment:As a Christian employer, I am the servant of Christ. I will respect my employee. I will not threaten my employee. I will work with sincerity of heart. I will work wholeheartedly. I will work diligently to provide for the needs of my family. I am always in Gods hand at my work. Christ and I work together. God is the boss and I am the steward at my work. God is the MIP at my work. I will seek to honour God, obey His word and do His will at my position.You may agree with this commitment. And you want to make this commitment. And if you want to make this commitment, committing your work to God, you can repeat with me. For some of you here, you may not be a Christian, and you are not able to say or agree with this commitment, but if you like, you could read it silently. So, if you are a Christian, and you want to make this commitment with God, we can read it together loudly.(Repeating the commitments.)I just said that this commitment can be applied in different parts of your life. For example, as a Christian student, I am the servant of God. As a Christian businessman, I am the servant of Christ. As a Christian wife, I am the servant of Christ. Our service to God should be at our work. But thinking of God as our MIP should flow into every part of our life. Once God holds the center of our life in our heart and our mind, our action will flow from our connection with Him. At workplace and in life, we will all meet challenges, controversies and conflicts. Maybe when you are in real life, you want to quit or give up in your situation, in your troubles. But now, I want to encourage you, ask God for the courage to face all the challenges, controversies, and all the conflicts, fulfill the commitments you made to God today, and remember that God is with you always. It is not about you, it is not up to you. We do not do anything by our own strength, but we do it by Gods power. God is always with us; God is always with us in every place, every moment and every step of our life. So we can come to Him to ask for His help at any time, to pray to Him at any time. So dear brothers and sisters, I want to encourage you, please come to God, remember, at your work, you are the servant of Christ; in your work, God is your MIP. God is watching over you. Jesus amazing love is upon you. He wants you to love Him, serve Him, please Him at your work as a return. Lets close with a prayer. Dear Lord, thank you so much for giving us this message. May you be our MIP in the different parts of our lives. May your name be exalted. We know you are the King of kings, you are the Lord of lords. You are worthy of all praises. You are worthy, we praise you, Lord. May you help us face all the difficulties at our work. We cannot solve all the specific troubles, but we can lift all of them into your hands, because we know we are in your loving hands. You keep being with us and you keep protecting us for every moment. May you encourage us and strengthen us so that we can have enough courage to work in the following weeks. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.Pastor Jessica WangDear brothers and sisters, I am very happy to have Gloria teach us through Ephesians. And it reminds us that God is our boss and we are all servants of God, ant it encourages that we do not work alone, but our Lord, the Trinity God is with us all the time. It has touched me a lot, and it encourages me and lets me know that as a pastor of this church, I am not working alone because God is with me. We are going to have the Holy Communion. Dear brothers and sisters, the Holy Communion is set by Jesus Christ for us, and we do this in remembrance that Jesus died for us in our place. So before we take the Holy Communion, lets all stand and pray together and confess our sins.Dear heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, Holy Spirit, Trinity God, thank you so much for today that you are calling us here to worship you; and we praise you for the lesson that you teach us. Today, we are going to take the Holy Communion, we know that when we do this, we remember you, and it reminds us that Jesus Christ died for all of us, and Jesus Christ shed His blood for all of us. And if we come in front of you, we accept you, and if we confess our sins, you will wash our sins away, and you will be with us, and you will make us holy, holy and holy. Lord Jesus Christ, we want to lift up all the brothers and sisters here in your hands, and please heal us, washes us and be with us. And also, we want to lift up the cup and the bread in your hands, and please bless them. Please be with us when we take the Holy Communion, and we will be united in you, in Christ, and we will grow in you, and we will be built in you and by your word and by your power. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.Dear brothers and sister, I Corinthians 11:23-26, say:23For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: the Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,24and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.25In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying,This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.26For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lords death until he comes.Dear brothers and sisters, the Holy Communion is for all Christians, if you are not baptized, please do not receive it. And if you are baptized, please receive the cup and the bread when the volunteers come in front of you, and please wait, then we will take the Holy Communion all together in the end. All the brothers and sisters who are baptized, please stand up. Holy Communion proceedsTranscribed and edited by Emily, Franz and Stefanie with strength and patience from the Lord Jesus Christ.

"42","20120617eng","2012-06-17","Larry Liu","How to be A Good Father","Proverbs 22:6","17 June 2012By Larry LiuHow to be a Good Father! Good morning. How is everybody doing today? Great. Happy fathers day! This is my first fathers day. I am so glad to join the fatherhood club this year. Our baby girl is almost 4 months old. I want to tell you it is so great to be a father. I can still remember the day she was born, just like it was yesterday. On Feb 25 at 3 am, my wife and I run out, and jumped into a taxi. And we pray that God, please help us make it. There were not many cars on the road. We got to Fuxing Hospital very quickly. I held her hand and told her to keep breathing, just relax. It was easy for me to say. After the physical examination, she quickly went into the delivery room. So I wait outside the delivery room. I walked back and forth, I just walked, waited, prayed, and looked at the clock over and over again. After a couple of hours, the door opened. Doctor told me, it is a girl. Mom and girl are both safe. It is a girl, it is a girl. I have a girl. Wow, thats incredible. Thats an incredible moment for me. I know at that moment I received two of the greatest gifts from God. A new life is given to us, and with that, I was given a title: father, the most honorable title for a man ever to have. From that point, I have a title: father. Our life changed forever, we know we cannot go back. After that exciting moment, I feel that being a father is both an exciting, and (sometimes) a terrifying assignment from God. You know everything is new. Our baby keeps growing and growing. There are so many things we need to learn. At every stage, we have new problems, so we have to keep learning. Its not easy. I remember the day I got married, on my wedding day, I strongly felt that there is a responsibility on my shoulders. I need to love my wife, and lead my family. On the day Joyce was born, I felt there are more responsibilities on my shoulders. I need to love her lead her and train her. A couple of weeks ago, Pastor Jessica called me and asked me to share a special massage on fathers day. I prayed to God to show me what to share. I know there are many couples who are going to have babies or just had a baby this year in our church. I read statistics that experts estimate that 20 million babies will be born this year in China, an increase of 5% over last year. No matter you like it or not, a baby boom is coming. You know, I just felt a strong need to share a massage, how to be a good father. You know I dont have much experience yet, I am not a good father yet. But we have the Bible. The Bible is our authority, guide and mirror. Today we are going to look at some of the Bible verses. You know in the Bible, there are many verses talking about parenting, how to raise your child, in both the Old Testament and New Testament. Today we are going to look at a few verses, also talk about a couple of principles. I cannot cover all the  principles today. I want to share two of the most important principles. I hope todays message can bless you, father. I hope this massage will bless you and help you become a good father. For brothers, no matter if you are married or not married yet, I hope todays message will help you prepare yourself. For sisters, this message is not just for men, I hope after this message you can pray for your husband or pray for your future husband, so they can be a good father, and you can raise your children together, biblically. Lets look at Ephesians 6:4, Father, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. The Bible tells us: Fathers, we are responsible for training our children in Christian  principles, values, and to believe in hope. Have you heard the Chinese saying: If you raise a child, but dont teach him, the father is to be blamed. Fathers, we are playing a very important role to bring the children up, to teach them, what is right, what is wrong in God eyes. Recently I watched a movie, called Courageous. I am sure you watched it before. It is a great movie for your families to watch together. If you havent watched it, I highly recommend you watch it. Courageous, the Chinese name is  yong qi. It talks about how to be a father and a responsible man. One line from that movie that I like very much goes like this: Part of being a man is to take responsibility. Fathers, we are responsible to protect our children, to love them, and to train them. Not only in training our children, we are responsible for all kinds of things. God gives us the assignment we need to do, faithful to the work, faithful to the service and ministry. Part of being a man is to take that responsibility. It is a very important role to represent heavenly father. The way our earthly father trained us is often how we see our Heavenly Father. Many people may be hurt by their earthly fathers. After they become Christians, its so hard for them to understand the love of Heavenly Father. I think after we become Christians, we need to forgive our earthly father if we were hurt by him, and seek reconciliation with our father, and tell him that we love him. Today is fathers day. Its a great opportunity, a great day to tell our father I love you. Thank you for all you did for me.You may say Well, I know Im responsible to train my child, but how? How can I be a good father? How can I raise my child biblically, so my sons or daughters can follow the Lord, know His truth, have a loving heart, good character, and serve God faithfully, and also be a good soldier for the Lord? How can I do that? What do you think we should do? We have to teach them, right? My first principle is this: teaching your child to love God, His truth, and help them live it out. Proverbs 22:6 said Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not turn from it. You know, for a child, the view of the world and himself is pretty much formed by age 3, and almost set in concrete by age 6. So the first 6 years, the early ages, are very important. We have to teach them what is right and what is wrong in Gods eyes, and teach them about our God, his amazing grace, His love, His promises, and help them to love God with their heart, their soul, their strength and their mind. Think about if we just tell our children You need to love God and believe his words, because its so important, but we dont believe in it. I mean if we dont submit to God, we dont do it, how do your children think? Let me give you an example, when I grew up, when I was in school, after school I wanted to watch TV. My parents always told me that do not watch TV. It is not good for you, it is a waste of your time. You should go to your room, close your door, and do your homework. So I did that, and my parents would watch TV after they said that. I was thinking, if you think watching TV wastes time, why do you do that? I think it will not take very long for your child to figure it out. Before I prepared this message, I asked a few mature Christians. I just see that children are so different, how did you raise your child? I found that the answer is almost the same. Just teach them, help them live out Gods words, and the family come to God together.  Some of them will say that bring your children, come to God in the morning, and it depends on the ages. If they are very young and cannot read, you can read to them. But when they grow up, getting a little bit older, you can lead them to read and pray together. Some people will say that well have a quiet time before they go to bed. The families come together to pray and talk about the Bible story. So its very important for the early ages of these children. Its too important to ignore.I remember I went to a couples house, they have three kids. I had dinner with them. Before the dinner, the father asked his children Who wants to pray for todays meal? The youngest one raised his hand, I want to pray! At that time, he was only three years old. Just a very simple prayer, Father, thank you for the meal. Amen! We dont have to ask your children to pray long prayers. You need to help your child develop the habit of praying and reading His words. I read somewhere that a father said I have to teach my child everyday, teach Gods words everyday and we pray together everyday. Sometimes, the childrens hearts are so hardened, they dont want to accept it. You have to do it everyday.Fathers, we are spiritual leaders at home, and our children need to see it demonstrated by their father. To be a good father, we need to teach our children to love our God, to follow Him, trust Him, and serve Him. First of all, we need to do it. Remember, since they will want to be just like you, and you need to be just like Him, we need to be like Jesus every day, be an imitator of God Jesus. I want to give you an illustration. I want to ask you: have you ever taken an airplane before? If you have taken an airplane, please raise your hands. Ok, thank you for listening. Extra points at the back. Just think for a moment. You and your little child are on the plane, flying on the plane. Suddenly, the airplane has a problem, oxygen masks fall out, my question for you is: who do you put the oxygen mask first? You or your child? If you listen carefully when you take an airplane, the flight attendant will always tell you that you are supposed to put oxygen mask on you first. I know, in our heart, we want to save our childrens life first, and we want to put oxygen mask on our child first. But the right answer is that we should put oxygen mask on ourselves first, because you can have energy to save your child, otherwise, both of you are going to die. Do you see the spiritual connection here? We need to connect to God, we need to breathe the spiritual air. We need to take care of ourselves, we need to have a good relationship with God, and we can pass it on, we can help our children. Its very important for us to have a good relationship with God first. If you are not married yet, you dont have a child yet, prepare yourself. Now its the time for you to prepare yourself to be a godly man.Some of you say that You know, I tried everything, I demonstrated it, I did the best I can. It just did not  work. My child just doesnt want to accept Jesus. My child just doesnt want to listen. What should I do? Well, I think you have to pray. We often need to pray for your children. I believe, God can truly change peoples heart, that includes our childrens. As parents, we need to continue to pray for our children. It will take time, there is no shortcut. I believe God can teach us so many things when we raise our children. Actually, many times, I believe parents and children will grow together in the Lord. God can help us become more patient, and trust in Him and rely in Him.Ok, lets move on. I want to ask you another question: fathers, what do you think the best gift you can give to your child? Toys?  iPad? Piano? There are expensive and good gifts, but I dont think its the best gift. Actually, I put down two things for the best gift. One is spending time with your child, and another one is to love your childrens mother. You got to spend time with your child and love  your childrens mother. Let me explain this. I think its very easy for fathers to think this way: I need to work hard, so I can provide the physical needs for my family. I need to work hard, day and night, and sometimes I have to stay up late or bring my work back home, because I want my wife and my child to have a happy life. So I work very hard for them. Maybe one day, you can be promoted. Maybe one day you can earn more money, you can buy the things they want and give them to your child and wife. Do you think those are the things they really want? I just think there are so many distant fathers in our society. Children can see their father or mother, maybe they are very successful in their career, can touch them, but they just can not feel their heart, just can not feel them and know their belief, and cannot get their guidance. Do you want to be that kind of father or mother? Be distant to your children? Im not saying Christians shouldnt work hard. I believe we should all work hard. We work hard for the right reason, we work for God, not money, not our manager, or not even our family. We know, we can ask God to give us wisdom and strength to help us and to work with Him, for His glory. I think that is the right attitude. We work with God, and we work for God. Brothers and sisters, I want you to check your heart, and see which category you are in. Pray and ask God to help you have right attitude to work.Fathers, if you want to have a good relationship with your children, you must spend time with them, to listen to their problems, answer their questions, to know their heart, and encourage them, guide them, and share your life with them. We have to communicate with them. If you just sit there and watch TV, thats not good enough. You dont follow what happened in your childs life. I know, living in this big city, everybody is busy, we are all busy. You know we have to balance our work and lead the family. I believe leading the family is the first ministry for us. You are the father and husband in your family. God put you into that place, a very unique place, and nobody can replace your role. Fathers, or husbands, just take your responsibility and lead your family.Loving your wife, your childs mother, is another of the best gifts to give to your child. The Bible comments that Husband, love your wife, just as Christ loves the church.(Ephesians 5:25) You can provide security peace, and comfort for your children by loving your wife, your childs mother. You and your wife are probably two of the most important people in the world to your children. Can you imagine one parent yelling at the other. How do children feel? Our children deserve security, and knowing that their home will always be there. Their home is filled with love. To wrap this up, fathers, we need to take the responsibility to train our children. Not just simply shift the responsibility to your wives or grandparents or teachers. We have a primary responsibility to train our children, to teach them Gods words, help them deal with their life problems. We are more than just providing physical needs for our family. We need to teach our children to love our God, follow Him and serve Him faithfully. Im sure its not easy to be a good father. We need to make a sacrifice, but I think it is worth it. Can you imagine yourself, 70 or 80 years old, regardless what job your son or daughter is doing. You look back, reflecting on your life, you see your children walking with the Lord, have loving hearts, good characters, and are good soldiers of the Lord. Thats the great joy we can get. John talked about in 3 John, verse 4, says  I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth. May God bless you and your family. PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 1"

You are faithful God. You are the one we praise and we want to give you thanks, praise and glory. Thank you for leading this church and blessing us; thank you for bringing people to this church, getting to know you and serve you here. Lord, we want to ask you to continue to lead this church; use us to bless others and give us wisdom and your vision to serve you and this community; to be a blessing in this city and this world.

Give her words to say and bless the massage and help her bring the power from you Lord; Lord I want to ask you to give us deeper understanding to your words and help us see your words as true bread of life. In Jesus precious name I pray. Amen.Preacher Pastor Lin: How to live a Christian life?Thank you very much. It is my real honor to be here this morning. And thank you very much for inviting me to worship with you here.This is in fact my second time to worship at this church. And my first time worshipping here was 3 years ago. At that time when I came into this church, I was first impressed by the architectural design of this church. It is a really nice and beautiful church. And I was told that your senior pastor Reverend Wu made good contributions to the setting of this church. But what impressed me all the more was the atmosphere of the worship, was the band, the music, the young people and the hospitality before, during and after the service. I really experienced the vitality of the church, the moving of the Holy Spirit in the midst and your love to Jesus Christ. My newly graduated student who now works here told me from time to time that this is a growing congregation. And today, I am very happy to see these with my own eyes. A growing congregation or a growing church means that there are always new people wanting to become Christians joining us here on Sunday. This is a real blessing from God to our congregation. We praise God for the amazing work of the Holy Spirit. For us, in fact, to become Christians may not be a too difficult thing. As the Bible says one believes with the heart and so it is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. This is written in Romans 10:10. It means if you are willing to believe God in your heart and confess in front of people that you are a Christian, then you become a Christian.The more difficult and always challenging question is, after we become Christians, how to live a Christian life? I think most of the teaching of the Christian church  throughout the history have been directed to this question: how do we live a Christian life? The  text from the gospel of Luke, Chapter 10, verses 25 to 37,  gives us a few examples of how to live a Christian life. And this is what I'm going to share with you this morning. How to live a Christian life?I believe that most of you are very familiar with the passage we just read. In this gospel reading, Jesus teaches the parable of the good Samaritan. The parable is not very long, it only contains 13 verses, but it carries very rich and profound meaning. We can not explore it fully during a single sermon. I will only pick 3 questions from this passage for us to reflect together upon the issue of how to live a Christian life. These questions are:1. What do you read there? Or how do you read it?2. Who is my neighbor? These 2 questions in fact are quoted from the text. And the third question is:3. How shall we be a neighbor?  HYPERLINK ""http://english.hdchurch.org/uploads/allimg/120801/0052493353-3.jpg"" \t ""_blank"" When the lawyer in Lukes story was to test Jesus, asking him what he had to do in order to inherit eternal life. Jesus replied by asking him two questions. What is written in the law? What do you read there?The lawyer as a Jewish legal expert certainly knew the Jewish law very well. A good lawyer is supposed to know all the details of the law. The lawyer answered Jesus by citing Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18 in the Old Testament. These are the two commandments to love God with one's heart, soul and strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, which represent the heart of the Jewish law. The lawyer's answer was complemented by Jesus. But if we read the Bible carefully, we can tell that the Jewish lawyer only answered Jesus' first question and left out the second question about what do you read there.What does the second question mean? What do you read there? It means how to interpret and live up to the text which was first read. The lawyer knew very well what was written in the law, but he had trouble interpreting it and living up to the law. A well-known Japanese theologian, Kosuke Koyama (of Union Theological Seminary, New York), wrote that the question of ""what do you read there"" has great significance in interpreting the Bible and even in doing the theology. Koyama stated that Jesus' question leads us towards relationship and engagement in the world around us. He argued that the Bible cannot be read in isolation from what has happened in the world and what is happening in the world. The more engaged we are in our confusing human history and occurring context, the more powerful the Bible will speak to us. In other words, what is written in the Bible is important to us, but what is more important is how we read the Bible in relation to the world in which we live and in relation to all of God's people. The question of ""what do you read there"" requires a reading of the Bible which is inclusive of the outsiders of our community and responding to the needs of all people in our real world. The Bible intends to bring us to the presence of the compassionate forgiving God in Jesus Christ so that our life may be transformed. The Jewish lawyer was not able to do such a reading so his life was not transformed. And therefore he had a further question to ask Jesus. The parable of the good Samaritan was Jesus' response to his further question of who is my neighbor. It is highly likely that the lawyer asked the question because he wanted to set a clear limit on who are the ones to be loved as he loved himself. He wanted to know who needed to be included in the category of neighbor and how far his responsibility extended. Jesus did not answer his question straightforwardly. Instead, Jesus told him the parable and then asked him which of these three (the priest, the Levite and the Samaritan) do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers. The lawyer answered the one who showed him mercy. Some biblical scholars persisted that people in Luke's church might have defined the neighbor as one's friend or a member of the community. Jesus, however, by making the moral hero a person outside the community, expanded the general definition of the neighbor. The parable ignores social boundaries and all reasonable thoughts of calculations that people make. Moreover, the parable not only helps people transform their understanding of whom they should love as they love themselves, but also provides them a model of a neighbor. The neighbor is not defined by geographical location, social location or even religious belief. The good Samaritan did not live very close to the Jews. Instead, they are almost separated from the Jews. The Samaritans social status was very low, and they did not even worship the same God as the Israel worshiped. The neighbor in Luke's gospel as defined is someone who has compassion and mercy. Someone went home when feels empathy and identifies as another human being. So we can tell that Jesus uses a lengthy parable to answer a comparatively short question: who is my neighbor?  HYPERLINK ""http://english.hdchurch.org/uploads/allimg/120801/0052495I5-4.jpg"" \t ""_blank"" At least it has two levels of significance. One is to tell us whom we shall love as we love ourselves. The second level of significance is to invite us to become the neighbor of others. It is for us to enter a relationship of neighboring. The word neighbor implies a kind of relationship. No one can simply have a neighbor; one must also be a neighbor. When I have a neighbor, for instance, he or she is my neighbor and meanwhile I am his or her neighbor, right? Neighboring is a two-way street. This may lead us to our third question. How shall we be the neighbor? At the end of this parable, Jesus asked the lawyer to go and do likewise. The phrase go and do likewise sheds light on the question. How shall we be the neighbor? Let us just pay attention to the word, likewise, what does it mean? Jesus asks us to do likewise. Jesus did not ask to do exactly what the good Samaritan did or to do whatever we want to do. As some biblical scholars note the adverb likewise invites us to use our imagination creatively to discover a new way of acting that is faithful to the story of a good Samaritan. If we allow our imagination to enter deeply into the particular story and envision possibilities in our own context, how might we then act as neighbors? Let us try, just try to imagine a few possibilities. As I just mentioned, to be a neighbor is to be someone who has compassion and acts with love and care towards ones neighbor. The neighbor who needs our help is not limited to the person who lives next door, or to an acquaintance, or even to a fellow community member. As some biblical scholar has pointed out, a neighbor in the gospel has a concrete description which includes tax collectors, prostitute, victim of robbery, lector, the handicraft, children having been looked down upon The love for neighbor has also been described concretely, which is embodied in the table of fellowship, emergency aid released from that and healing. The neighbor as some biblical scholar suggested, can be extended as the next person we meet. As the next person we meet is our neighbor, so who will be the next person we meet after this service? On our way home, on our way to school, to work everyday or after we come back from a party. It could be anybody. It could be somebody who needs our help. It could be a beggar, a wounded person, a handicapped child, or migrant workers gathering together wanting to get his or her salary back. What should we do? How should we help them and solve their problem and meet their needs? Are we going to try to meet some of their immediate needs as the good Samaritan did? For the wounded person who fell into the hands of the robbers? I am sure that most of us would say we would like to, we would like to but The word but can imply a lot of things. It can imply that we do not have enough compassion as the good Samaritan had. It can also imply that we have the same compassion, but we are not able to make the same accomplishment because of our own inadequacy or the external situation.In one of my ethics classes at one seminary, one student said that he could not be the good Samaritan. He said that first of all, he was not courageous enough to be the good Samaritan because he was afraid that the wounded person and his family might accuse him as the accident maker but not the helper. This might sound familiar to us because we read it from the media or the reports from time to time. My daughter is thirteen years old and she was very eager to get some small money on the bus to the beggars. But after one day, she realized that she was cheated and then she became hesitant to give her money away. And my student also continued to say that he was also afraid that the robbers might come back to rob him after they knew that he was wealthy. I do not think my students concern as excuses. In fact, this student has much compassion to others. He is one of our best students. I appreciate his honesty, but I still ask him, what can you do then? You just share with us what you are not able to do, but what can you do? Or you would be just like the priest running away? The answer is of course not, but what shall we do? How should we be the neighbor? Here, I think the phrase go and do likewise can play big role in our answers. As in this parable, a traveler being robbed on the way from Jerusalem to Jericho was a daily occurrence in Jesus time and even until much later. It was a road of narrow rocky, passage ways and of solemn turnings, making it a happy haunting ground for robbers. A friend of mine who has visited this area several years ago told me that even today, the path from Jerusalem to Jericho is quite geographically dangerous and robbery takes place from time to time. Now is there any way to prevent people from being robbed on the way from Jerusalem to Jericho? Is there any way to change the status to offer protection for travelers on this road? Or is there any way to let the robbers repent and change their job?  HYPERLINK ""http://english.hdchurch.org/uploads/allimg/120801/005249AU-5.jpg"" \t ""_blank"" In our society, we do need a lot of good Samaritans and we not only need them to help those wounded people, but also need them more to help people from being wounded. We should all try to be the good Samaritans. We not only need to help the weak and the needy, but providing them food, clothes, money or other material supplies; we also need to try to help them improve their situation through education, training and spiritual comfort. The Christian churches in history have done much along this line and have transformed many peoples lives. Chinese Christians nowadays are also encouraged to engage in social service and to do good deeds for the society. We can do the same thing as previous generations did, but we will do it more creatively and relevantly to our time because we need to follow the teaching of Jesus, go and do likewise. To be able to do so, we need transformation. The story of the good Samaritan stands as a challenge towards transformation of our daily life and business, which lies in the heart of the practice of the discipleship. The transformation of our life is a necessary step for us to live a Christian life. In the process of transformation, our own perspective has to be changed; our prejudice against those people we dont like has to be overcome; our compassion and love have to be extended and become more inclusive and our spiritual wisdom will grow to become better disciples of Jesus Christ. My hope is that our reflection this morning on the parable of the good Samaritan can be somehow helpful for us to live a Christian life; by reading this story, we can conclude that to live a Christian life, we need to read the Bible with the engagement towards what is happening in our world; we need to transform ourselves by being a well of our neighbor and more importantly, we need to enter a neighborhood relationship. We need to become the neighbor with compassion and to try to help what people need in new and different ways. In a word, we need to respond to Jesus command go and do likewise creatively and faithfully as we live up to the commandment of loving God with all our heart and soul, and with all our strength and mind, and loving our neighbors as loving ourselves. Amen PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 1"

So the very first sentence came into my mind was that God is my best friend. And the moment I put down those words, a sweet, sweet feeling came to my heart and warmed my heart. I just want to tell you that our Lord Jesus indeed is our Saviour. But He is not someone who just came to save us once and then let us all alone, He is a Saviour who not only saves us, but continually pursues a love relationship with us. I want you to know that our Lord wants to be our best friend. You know Chinese culture values guanxi (relationship), either networking relationship or loving relationship whatever you call it. I can tell you this, the best guanxi, the best networking resource you can get is our Lord Jesus.Lets bow our head in prayer:Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for sending your only begotten son Jesus to die for us and pay for our debts, and because of that, we are no longer your enemies, but your friends. Lord, we thank you for pursuing continually a love relationship with us and you really want to be close to us. So Lord, I pray that you would draw us close to you, and let us everyday be closer to you. Lord, please transform us. And Lord, we also pray for todays service. May your Holy Spirit lead todays worship, and may you just clean our hearts and minds so we can worship you wholeheartedly. And Lord, we also lift up todays preacher Cathy into your mighty hands. Lord, please speak through her, and let your word touch our hearts. Lord, just help us, just replace our hearts with your heart, and our eyes with your eyes. In Jesus holy name we pray. Amen.The worship leaders prayer:Dear Lord, Father, you give us all the things, all the blessings. Dear Lord, Father, we face the problems, frustration, and face a lot of troubles, you know that. Maybe we do not know your mind, or what we do, but we should bow down our hearts to your own way. Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you for giving us the strength, the power, let us be the deliverers of your gospel, let more people know you, to know your name, to know your holy name. Thank you, Father.Todays scripture is 1 Corinthians 3:13,His work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light, it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each mans work.The sermon topic is Faith, todays preacher is Cathy Zhang.Sermon by Cathy ZhangGood morning, please join me in a very short prayer. Lord, send your spirit to us, please. We are weak and we need your help. And we need your spirit to fill our hearts so that we can walk in peace. May the words from my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, and be the bridges to these souls that you want to touch. In Christs name, we pray. Amen.My scripture is 1 Corinthians chapter thirteen, verse thirteen. So I will read it again. It is very simple. After Saint Paul said all that of love, he finished that, And now these three remain: faith, hope and love, the greatest of these is love.But I am focusing on faith today. Introduction to the passage:Christianity in China is quite unique if I compare it with the development in other countries. It is because in China, there are many scholars in the universities and institutes, they are doing research related to Christianity, they are teaching courses related to Christianity, but they are not believers yet, or they may not be willing to be called a believer or seeker. They are defending Christianity in front of others when necessary, and they are sometimes trying to explain the situation to others on behalf of Christianity. And some of them even say that please do not say Christianity is a foreign religion, it is a Chinese religion now. They are not believers, and they do not want maybe they prefer to stay outside the gates, or on the border. One of my friends is like this. She teaches in a university, and her research topic is Woman in the Old Testament. One day she asked me, What quality do you think is the most important in Christianity? She knows I am a believer. You know, I thought a lot, then I said, Faith, hope and love. She paused for a while and said, Why? I think its humility. My goodness, humility! Of course, humility is important. And I think, humility is truly a very important quality for Christians, and I can tell why she thinks humility is important. It is because she has been around some Christians, and she does not feel the humility that she has read in the Bible, or she has heard in the sermons. Yes, a lot of times we talked about humility, but we do not behave that way. Humility is important and it is so hard, even for me. I know it is very hard for me to be humble all the time. I have to keep reminding myself to be humble, and it is so easy to show my arrogance, and I did not realize that. However, no matter how important humility is, humility is a kind of, how to say, an outer look, one of the appearances of our faith. Faith, hope, love. Although Paul said, among the three, the biggest, the greatest one is love, actually he still implies that faith, presupposes or is the first quality. I still have to say, yes, tenderness, humility, love, compassion or other qualities are very important, but without faith, we cannot carry them out. Like what I said, humility is important, but I cannot be humble all the time and I have to rely on my faith to remind me to be humble, And if I do not have the faith at the beginning or as the foundation, it is very hard or even harder for me to be reminded, even, of humility. So today I just try to say something about faith. Defining faith:When we try to give a definition of something, especially a term like this, it is very difficult. And faith in Chinese, faith has synonyms like belief or trust. See, in Chinese, the translation is very interesting; faith, we translate into Chinese as what? the first character, means trust; means look up. And believe, we translate it asalso means trust means ideas. So the Chinese tells (them apart) very clearly. We seldom use You know  and We know that has some kind of different connotation about something that you look up to, that has a kind of loyalty, or leads you to something that may be hard to describe; that you do not need to prove, or you do not need a kind of ground for believing. But referring to a set of ideas or convictions, or doctrines, is still being used to describe the faith. A lot of times, its difficult, so we say, first say, something about what faith is not. What faith is not? What is faith not?First, I think faith does not only refer to a set of ideas, that I want to say, you know, doctrines. It does not mean that you are forced to agree with certain doctrines (to know) that you have the faith. Some churches set a very high gate for entrance. You have to accept certain doctrines, then you can get in or be accepted. And some denominations think if you do not say you agree with these five basic criteria or doctrines or tenants, you cannot call yourself a Christian. I have to say, it is all a kind of human effort to narrow down Gods kingdom, or Gods grace. It does not mean that you have to understand what it means to say, God is one substance with three persons or in three persons. We sing holy holy God almighty, and we say we believe in trinity that God is one substance in three persons, and many do not understand what that means. And for some of them, they cannot say that they will accept or agree because they do not understand. Then you exclude them out of Gods kingdom? We cannot.So faith does not that mean that your have to agree with certain ideas. And, second, faith also does not mean certainty or certitude. If you think that faith means something that you can grasp and hold very firmly, that is not faith at all. See, a lot of people, they try to go against, they do not agree with religion, they do not think any people have faith are reasonable, because they think it is not scientific. So if you still try to think that faith is something that you can be assured, always be assured, always something that is firm and certain, and can be explained scientifically, thats not faith.And third, faith is not a kind of believing attitude or any believing attitude. So sometimes I think I want to be pious, and try to show my piety, and then, this kind of believing attitude means that I have the faith, and I am showing to others that I have faith. It is not true.A friend who is not a believer complains to me that her roommate is a believer and she shows her piety all the time by holding the Bible all the time in hands, reading the Bible all the time and also praying a long prayer before the meal so everybody has to wait. She does not realize that she is showing the arrogance. Always remember that when we show faith, we may show arrogance. We think we are better than those who do not have faith and we want to show off. And we are showing our arrogance. If you do have faith and are humble, you will think of others need first, instead of yours only. What is faith?So what is faith? Faith is a relationship first of all. Sophie talked about Jesus, God, being our best friend. For this relationship, a lot of times you are wondering how can I have it? How could I tell it? This relationship is, first of all, set on the base that God is a faithful God. So this relationship is initiated by God and is based on the fact that God has faith in you. God has trust in you and He trusts that you can be transformed, you can be better, you can have a different life, and you can help others. God has faith in you. This is the foundation for this relationship. And because of this relationship, you are responding to Gods love and the relationship. You are responding to that call, that love and that compassion. It is not something that you are in trade with God. I am doing this for you, so you should benefit me and bless me. I follow all the doctrines and I accept all the things even I do not understand. I do good works everyday and I control my desire. Then you should bless me. It is not this kind of relationship. Even in the love relationship of our human beings, the lovers like to talk about how much they have put into the relationship. How much I have done for you and you are not repaying back the same amount of love to me. I love you more than you love me. But do not you realize that this is sort of your pain in this relationship? When you have pain that is so deep in your heart as you love someone, it is because you are measuring it from your perspective. You do not realize that if you do call it LOVE, you pay, contribute and devote without any expectation or any condition, because it is for the benefit of others, not your own. So the relationship with God is like this. Faith is this kind of relationship of trust; and faith is trust (from God) but not certainty (about us). When you trust somebody wholly, actually you should leave freedom for them. That is a real trust or a complete trust. God leaves a great freedom for you, giving you the freedom to choose, hesitate, doubt, suspect, question and even anger. That is Gods love and Gods trust in you. God is waiting because He has trust in you. It is fine that you still cannot get there, you still have so many questions in your mind, and you still want to be angry and disappointed; that is Gods trust. And the feelings are the same for you. If you truly love somebody, are you able to give them freedom even though they may not be paying back the same amount of love to you? It is hard, I have to say. Even for me as a mother, I love my son dearly and fully; but a lot of times, my love is compelled, which means my love for him is compelling and I am forcing him to follow my will, my order or to do things that I want him to do. And I think I am doing it in the name of Love. Actually, that is not trust at all. So faith is trust (from God) but not certainty (about us). You have the full trust, but still, you have the space to grow, to change, to question and to doubt. Second, faith is real and dynamic. It is not fixed or in certain type. Faith in different people may show differently. Different persons may have different ways of having faith in their hearts. So this is not something that you can produce or work on. So it is not fair that you compare peoples faith, thinking he is stronger and the other is weaker. A lot of times, you use faith to explain suffering, thinking that he is suffering because he has small or little faith that God is punishing his unbelief. That is not right.Faith is real and dynamic that it will work in your heart. The things that can be changed unconsciously are that you cannot try to behave in certain ways. Like I always try to remind myself that I have to be pious and I pick up the appearance to be pious by praying all the time and saying thanks be to the Lord all the time or getting up early in the morning, all these outer appearances. NO! In that way, you are controlled or fixed and are not free. That is not what God has expected. When you have faith, the faith will make you different. What will faith do to you?So what difference will faith bring to you? First, faith can help you relieve the pressure and burden so that you are not so self-concerned, thinking that you have the responsibility for something. Truly we are responsible for something. And we should work with our efforts; we should work with our hearts. However, it is still God who is making the final change and transformation of us. You have worked on somebody, trying to bring the gospel to them, and trying to bring them to faith. But they are still not (believing) yet. And that is always the last point. Do not blame yourself. You have to say, Yes, it is time to test my patience, and my faith in God. And I have to pray that God will make him change, his heart change.In Chinese, we like to say,  (Man proposes, and God disposes)The Chinese usually say that, for human beings, we work very hard to get that 70% done, but there are still 30% that we have to lift it up to heaven, to God. We are not God. So when you think that you could fix everything, you could get everything done, you are thinking yourself as God. That is dangerous. So when you think of that, that faith helps relief the burden, and that responsibility; so you are not that anxious anymore.And the second, faith will help us understand that each one of us has our own calling, so our faith will be different. Your friend might come to faith differently. You cannot share your experience, and you cannot share theirs. So each of us has our own calling and responsibility, and you just have to respect that. And for us, we are responsible steward; and a lot of times, there is a chance to teach you how to be a servant or a steward.Recently, I have been working under a great pressure. As a group leader, I have several very talented people working with me. And one of them kept on giving me problems, rejecting my wish anyway. And I have to say I was very angry, because it was not my way. I am a person who finds it very hard to say no to requests. And that brings me a lot of troubles. I do not encourage you to do that. I guess this is what I have to say no. But we always think that when you are young, and you are still pursuing your career, it is better for you to say yes to your leader. Then you figure out how to do it. Maybe you do not know how, but you could consult people. And it is not wise to say no. That is my way. And I think the others would do the same. And I think, if you follow my way, it is good for you, for your future, your career, and your prosperity.No! Superficially, I said, OK, you can do it, whatever you want. I respect you. But one day later, he said to me, Cathy, you know the one who does not want to follow your order, who does not want to do it in your way. I was shocked. I said, Really? He said, Yes, it is on your face. It moved my heart. Superficially, I said I respect your order, but I was angry, irritated, anxious, and that was on my face. And that was actually in my attitude, my behavior; it was a kind of atmosphere that surrounded me. We are sharing the office, and he could feel that. I am very grateful that he told me. So I cracked up and laughed. And I said sorry, so I changed. And I had to pray to help myself to change that in my heart, I could really give them the time and space to think, and I have to change my way sometimes.I was talking to another friend why everybody could be angry except me. I cannot be angry. Why everybody could complain except me? It is because we are watched, especially when people know that you call yourself a Christian openly. And (especially) if you do not behave as they have expected; it is hard. So that one helps us understand that we have different callings. The third one is that faith will help you or empower you to pursue truth, and especially, faith will help you understand yourselves more. When I say to understand yourselves more, I mean the weaknesses, the imperfection. Each one of us is imperfect, we have to admit that though we hate to look at the ugly parts of ourselves, I hate it too.And I feel so bitter and angry a lot of times when I see my ugliness. And there are many times like this I have to say.But faith will help you with that. And so you can accept your own imperfection. And actually, to know who you are, you become wise. It is also in Chinese, (know yourself) To know yourself is harder than to know others, it is harder. And on the Greek temples, they say, To know yourself. It is not on my level to know myself. The earlier you know yourself and accept who you are, the more comfortable and happier you will be.I also like the verses in 1 John, chapter 3, verses 18-20,18Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.19This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence:20if our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.So when a lot of times you condemn yourself, think of these verses. We belong to the truth. The faith will make you understand that we belong to the truth and God knows our weaknesses, and God accepts us as a whole being, including our weaknesses, God knows everything. So it is fine. When you know yourself, you know your advantages, you know your weaknesses, face them and accept them. With Gods help, you could work on them.The fourth point about faith bringing change is that you can keep on reasoning. It does not mean that when you believe, or when you have faith in God, in Jesus Christ, you lose your reasoning power, the power of your reasoning; you need to have this kind of so-called blind faith. No, you still have the power of reasoning, and you still pursue what the ancient fathers told us that our faith is always seeking understanding. It does not mean that when you have faith, you worship God alone, you just mind your own business, to be a pious Christian, a follower only. No, you are in this world, you are bearing witness for God in different ways, in your life, in your studies, in your work, in your mouth, in your actions and also in your trying to explain your faith to others. You are using the power of reasoning. And it is fine when the others question you, and you allow them to use reason to question, to doubt and to suspect. And also interpretation diversity is embraced by God. You respect (each other) because we come from different cultures. The interpretation of the Bible should be different in a Chinese context because we grow in this Confucius, Buddhist and Taoist atmosphere and with that kind of elements in us, if we integrate the context into the interpretation of the Bible. It is a contribution to the diversity of the Bible instead of something bad. It is a blessing that the diversity can be embraced by us now.Coming back to my points about faith, faith is difficult; faith is a blessing; faith is hard to describe; and faith is what we have and what we want to have. So faith is not certainty; faith is a relationship, a kind of a complete trust from God in you, and also your response to God. That faith will give you power in your heart, embracing you, freeing you, to give you energy to be braveand to think actively.May God bless His words. Amen.Revised by Emily, Esther and Franz, and edited by Liu Laoshi with grace from God in all the work that we do for Him, and in Him. PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 7"

It is so good to share my understanding of the Word of Jesus Christ with our fellow brothers and sisters at Haidian Church. It is always a blessing to worship together with brothers and sisters. It is always a blessing to sing songs with our worship team, and I love the songs that they were singing this morning. Id like to rise like wings on eagles. I like to come to the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ. When I was singing that song, it seemed to me that our Lord Jesus Christ was walking side-by-side with me. I love the song they were singing this morning, Here I am to bow down, here I am to worship because when I was singing that song, it seemed to me our Lord Jesus Christ, our Heavenly Father was reaching out his hand, touching my head, touching my shoulder, and touching my heart; healing me and restoring me with His power. So, I love those songs and I am grateful that we have such a great worship team to lead us to the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ.This morning, our preaching will be focusing on the first part of Acts 2. In fact, this mornings preaching will be focusing on the first part of the first verse of the book of Acts, chapter 2. Here Bible tells us when the day of Pentecost came, they were all together. Who? Disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. They were all together in one place. Why were they together? The rest of the second chapter of Acts 2 tells us that they were waiting to be filled with the Spirit, that they can speak, and that they can preach the Gospel with the tongues of other people. So, they were waiting, they were together in one place to be filled with the Spirit. They were waiting in one place so that they could be empowered, so they could be strengthened with the power from God, from Jesus, that they could preach the Gospel which is about the birth of Jesus Christ. So, that is why they were waiting in one place; that is why they were together.And the Bible also tells us in Acts 2:41-42, On the same day 3000 people were baptized. So, 3000 people were added to their number. So brothers and sisters, how many people were together that day worshiping our Lord? More than 3000 were gathering together worshipping our God, waiting to be filled with the Spirit, and were filled with the Spirit that day. And  all of them came to share the Gospel. And brothers and sisters, we are also gathering together today in one place here at Haidian Church. What are some significant things we can learn from that gathering of the disciples, from the gathering of those 3000 people when the day of the Pentecost came? I think there are three things we can learn from them.Disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ and those 3000 people were together. They were together. Not only seeking to be filled with the Holy Spirit, but also to worship God. In the meantime, they were together to demonstrate and also to show to the world that our Lord is faithful, that our Lord is trustworthy, and that our Lord fulfills His promises. What kind of promises did our Lord fulfill on that day? What kind of promises did the Lord keep on that day? In the Gospel according to John, chapter 12, verse 32, And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself. That is one of the promises He was giving to His disciples when He was ascending to heaven. One of the other promises He had given to His disciples was in Romans 16:26: But now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might believe and obey Him. Those are some of the promises our Lord fulfilled when the day of Pentecost came. Those are some of the promises that our God fulfilled when the disciples of the Lord were all together in one place. Those are some of the promises that our Lord fulfilled when the 3000 people were added to their number. So you see, the gathering of disciples and  the gathering of the 3000 people demonstrate and also show to the world that our Lord is faithful. He keeps His promises. He is the only one who is trustworthy. Acknowledging our weaknesses is a strength. Acknowledging something we cannot do is a strength. So you see, in this world, people lie. But, only our Lord Jesus Christ keeps His promises. Hes the one who is faithful and trustworthy. He tells us if we come to Him, He will save us. I think that is something that we can learn from the gathering of the disciples of Jesus Christ.And second, what we can learn from the gathering of the disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ and those 3000 people is that we can work together with our Lord Jesus Christ who is in heaven, and work together with the Spirit who was sent down to the world by Jesus Christ. The disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ and those 3000 people worked together with the son of God and also worked together with the Spirit to build a church on this earth; to build a nation of this Lord Jesus Christ on earth; to build a kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ on this earth; to form an army so that this army can share the Gospel in this world. They were gathering together to build a nation, to build a city, to build a kingdom on the earth. Who were working together? Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, the disciples, and all those who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. So, this kingdom was built up from the top to the bottom. From the top down. So you see, brothers and sisters, those disciples and those other believers were building a nation on this earth from the top down which can lead people of this world step-by-step, bit-by-bit to the presence of Jesus Christ who is sitting on the right hand of our Heavenly Father. But brothers and sisters, I want to remind you that people of this world have been building their own city, their own nation, their own country from the bottom up. In Genesis 11, the Bible tells us that back in those days, there was only one common language, there was only one common speech. And one day people said to each other, Let us make bricks. So you see back in those days, people became smart enough to invent a new technology of making bricks. They thought they were smart and powerful enough that they wanted to build a city for themselves with a tower in the city that reached to the heavens, so that they could make a name for themselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth. Let me repeat this again. People back in those days, because they believed that they had already become powerful enough to make bricks that they wanted to build themselves a city with a tower in the center that reached to the heaven. You see they were building a city from the bottom up, so that they could make a name for themselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth, even though our Lord asked Abraham to be the blessing of all the nations. So, you see that people tended to build their cities, build their nations from the bottom up. Brothers and sisters, I want to encourage you, urge you to work together with Jesus Christ and with the Holy Spirit to build a city, build a country from the top down, so that you can step-by-step, bit-by-bit come to the presence of our Heavenly Father. Last year, last fall my wife got a short message from my daughter who was going to college in southern California. And in that message, my wife was told that one of my daughters best friends came back to Beijing for a few days. But, unfortunately, tragically she was robbed of her wallet, her belongings. So, she was desperately in need of help. So, my daughter told my wife to come to this ladys desperate rescue by bringing her some money. And in that message, that ladys telephone number was left with my wife. So, my wife was so nice and she picked up the phone and started to dial the number. But, she had a second thought because there were so many frauds on the internet these days, so she called my daughter in the middle of the night by Los Angeles time. And my daughter said, Well, I didnt send any message to you. I dont have this kind of friend in Beijing. So my wife thought, ok so this is fraudulence again. But brothers and sisters, the reason I wanted to share this with you is that we human beings, we people tend to build our own city; to build a city for ourselves from the bottom up. Every day we build our own empire, we build our own nation. Every day we build our own city by connecting me, myself to another person, and to another person through another person. Then we connect to the world and build up a nation for ourselves. But you dont know and you dont realize that you are not aware that demons are also there, pushing you and  trying to swallow you. And these days, many young people tend to like to play computer games. They try to break through, they try to storm one strategic path. And after they storm this strategic path, they see a piece of gold there, or they see some money there, or they see a half-naked lady there. And they start to work even harder to storm another strategic path. So one after another they are accumulating more money, more gold, or more fine, young, beautiful naked ladies. They will not recognize, they are not aware that demons are there and ambushing them. When we are doing those things, we are building a nation, we are building a whole empire from the bottom up. But brothers and sisters, I want to urge you to get together, to work together with the Holy Spirit, with Jesus Christ to build a nation from the top down. Then we can walk up, bit-by-bit to the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ. The gathering of the disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ and the gathering of those 3000 people when the Pentecost came also tell us today that we together should do five things. We, like the disciples of the Lord, should devote ourselves to the teachings of the Apostles. We should devote ourselves to the breaking of bread, to fellowship, to prayer so that we can be ready to be sent out to preach the Gospel, to share the message of the good news of Jesus Christ with unbelievers. In the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11, the people could be tied up to this tower. Here, our Lord Jesus Christ worked together with His disciples, worked with the believers to build up a country from the top down, so that they can be ready. They could be armed and empowered with the Word of the Lord to be ready to go out, to be sent out to preach the Gospel. So, brothers and sisters, I truly want each one of us to come to the presence of the Lord, to be filled with the Holy Spirit just like the disciples of the Lord. To be filled with the Spirit to go out and preach the Gospel, and to be a living Christian not a dead Christian. Brothers and sisters, today I believe that you are all living Christians. But, today I want to name a few living Christians who are from the United States. They were in the States. They were very good Christians in the States, but they always remember they are not supposed to be tied up to their own church, to their own people. They are supposed to be sent out to other nations, to other countries to make the presence of the Lord available to people who need salvation. So, I would like to have them come to the front to share their testimony for us. Steve.Steve Allan:Hello, my name is Steve Allan and this is my daughter, Hannah. And listening to Pastor Wus message in Acts 2 reminds me of what happened in Acts 1:8 prior to that, where it says, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. And its that question in a room this size with these  many people, Can you really make a difference? Can the Holy Spirit use you to make a difference? And a lot of the attitude is, Well, yeah, as soon as I graduate from high schoolAs soon as I graduate from collegeAs soon as I get marriedWhen I get a good jobWhen I have enough moneyOk, when I retireOk, when I die. And we spend our life waiting for that perfect time where you embrace the things of the Lord. And people, today is that day, to embrace the things of the Lord. You know I invite my daughter Hannah to co-share this with me, because when she was 11, we had a moment in our adoptive life as a family-- we had adopted a little girl from Guangzhou and were in the process of adopting another one from Chongqing -- we were invited to participate in helping some other children in southern China. They sent pictures to us of these 20 kids. And picture one came, and picture two came, and picture three. And picture eight came and Hannah, who is 11 years old at the time, she was sitting right next to me at the time, and she goes, Dad, I think she is supposed to be my sister. That was the same response I had, like, huh really?! And so this was a moment that Hannah was hearing from the Lord. Sometimes we expect to hear the Lord in earthquakes or maybe giant rainstorms, but sometimes its that still small whisper that we try to hear from the Lord. And so Im going to let Hannah continue the story. Hannah?Hannah Allan:Hi. As my dad said, my name is Hannah and I just graduated from high school so Im 18 years old, and Im just your typical, normal teenage girl. I want to share how the Holy Spirit has moved me. It doesnt matter how old you are, but God can teach you and move you no matter how old. Last year I lived here in China, and I interned at an orphanage and I taught English and I did physical therapy. I was coming to China to serve, and as it says in James 1:27 to care and to love the orphans. I had no idea that that summer would change my life. There was this little girl named Joelle. She was blind, deaf, and had many other complications. They said she was the next to die. I have three sisters from China and I know that if any of them were in that position, I would hope that someone would love them. I just felt drawn to this little girl who laid in the corner of the room. Every day I would go and hold her for hours wondering which day would be my last with her. Even though there were kids healthier than she was, God called me to care for Joelle. I learned through this that God calls you to do hard things. For me, this was a hard thing, but another thing that was hard was that there were dozens of kids just like Joelle. This wasnt something I chose. It was the Holy Spirit that spoke to my heart. It doesnt matter your age. If God called you to do it, just do it. As an 11 year old girl being called by my family to adopt this little girl, I had no idea. I just had a feeling that she was supposed to be my sister. And a year later, she was my sister. Mother Teresa said, If you cant feed 100, feed one. My one was my sister, Grace. My one was Joelle. Who is your one?Steve Allan:And you see, this is what I have to live with. But as a little girl, she was sensitive to the Holy Spirits leading. At 11, not understanding what it meant, she heard the voice of the Lord. And if you go back to the book of Isaiah 30:21where it says, do not turn to the right or to the left, but listen to the voice behind you, saying, This is the way; walk in it. This is the way; walk in it. And just as Pastor Wu was talking about how to spread the Gospel to the corners of the world, its just what we are trying to do in the United States. We want people to come to know Jesus Christ as much as Pastor Wu wants the people in China come to know Jesus Christ. And so as youre sitting there wondering, Can God use me? Well, he used an 11-year-old girl. And it has radically changed her life, just as it has radically changed the lives of those that shes come across. Thank you. PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 1"

First would you please join me with a prayer to our Father.Dear Heavenly Father, thank you so much for saving us from our sins. Lord thank you for joining us in the service to worship you today. Lord we want to lift up the sermon into Your hands. May Your Holy Spirit come upon me, may Your Word come out from my mouth, and may Your Word become my strength, wisdom and comfort.

I pray for all the congregation here, may You be with them, may Your Holy Spirit open their hearts, open their eyes to know Your Word, to love You as their response today. Lord, help us fall in love with You, help us understand Your Word, help us live in Your Word. I pray in Your name, Amen.I dont know how many of you still remember several months ago, our English fellowship held a special activity called dating workshop. How many of you came to that dating workshop. Could you please raise your hand? I remember several months ago, we had a dating workshop on a Thursday night. So how many of you came to that dating workshop, could you raise your hand? Not too many. I want to ask another question: How many of you here are still single? So many. How many of you already have boyfriends or girlfriends? Just a few. How many of you are looking for a boyfriend or a girlfriend? So could you please raise your hands? So many of you want to be single in your whole life? Because I see many people who are single raise their hands, but when I ask you how many of you want to have a boyfriend or girlfriend in the future, just a few of you raise your hands. So how many of you have already married? We know, as human beings of our age, sometimes we think we want to look for a boyfriend or a girlfriend, we want to know how to look for a life-long partner in our life, we want to know how we could spend time when we are single, who is the person God has prepared for us, what is Gods will for my life, how can I have a very healthy relationship, what can I do during my dating time, how can I be a Godly husband or wife in my marriage? We know many people have those needs, so our English fellowship has decide to have a new sermon series, called Love Sermon Series. We want to use this series to fill some peoples needs and provide guidance for Biblical dating and marriage. So in the following weeks, we will start a new sermon series, which is called Love Series, and we want to encourage you to bring your friends to come to listen to this series. We hope this series can fill you needs and provide a Biblical guidance to your dating or marriage right now and in the near future. For the first week, we want to start by thinking how we prepare ourselves when we are still single? I know some of you have already raised your hands because youre already married. But I think some principles we teach today are suitable no matter what the situation is. When we are still single, how shall we prepare ourselves? How do we live a lifestyle that pleases God? Therere many young people attending this English fellowship every week. As for myself, Im a college pastor and Ill see many young people in my life. At this age, many young people are eager to have a relationship. Its very normal. Its the time of life that we need to think about relationships. Some people may find a life partner very easily and very quickly, but for others, theyll be single for many years before they have a life partner. Some people may ask a question like this: I want to find a Christian boyfriend or girlfriend, why is it so hard? I have a desire, that from Bibles perspective, believers should marry believers, I have this pure heart and I want to look for a Christian boyfriend or girlfriend, but its so hard to find. Do I still have to obey this principle from Bibles perspective? Or I can just find a non-believer? Why doesnt anyone like me? I have loved God so much, why doesnt God give me a life partner?I love God and Im willing to wait for God, so why hasnt God yet answered my prayers? I have been praying for my life partner for years and years, why God still hasnt answered my prayers? Why? Whats Gods will for me? Single forever? For my whole life? For how many years I still have to wait? As a single person, how can I prepare my life for marriage? God hasnt given me a life partner, is it because I havent prepared well? Or is it because Im not good? Or because God doesnt like me, or God doesnt love me? Or is it because Im not worthy to have a life partner? I dont know how many of you have those questions, or other questions you are facing now? Dear brothers and sisters, have you had questions like these? Have you been struggling for looking for a life partner? I pray that Gods Word will comfort you today, will comfort you this morning. I know some young people when they face some relationship problems, they would commit suicide. If you open up websites or TV, you can see one of the reasons people committing suicide is relationship problem. So for our church, we hope we can get to know the right attitude from Bible, and such attitude will guide us to a happy life, to have a happy marriage and also a happy single time. So as singles, we first need to know what love is. Whats the definition of love? Where does love come from? Why we love each other? Why do we need love? Why does love exist in this world? And from the Scripture, we know, we love because He first loved us (1John 4:19). Who first loved us? Our God, our Trinity God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This Trinity God loved us first, so we need love. Because He loves us and Gods nature is love so when He created the world, He put the desire of love in our hearts. So we need love, we need parents love, we need friends love, and we also desire a lovers love. First we need to know how God loved us. Bible says in 1 John 4:9-10, He sent his one and only son into the world that we may live through him. Why did God have to send His one and only Son into the world? Because we are all sin against God, we are all sinners, we all commit many sins. Because of sins, we are separated for God. And because He loves us, He sent His one and only Son, His most beloved Son to die on the cross to save us. Dear brothers and sisters, do you think youre sinners? I totally agree with this. I cannot imagine how sinful I am inside. But our God sent His most beloved Son to die on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins. We have so many sins, we are so bad, if you can see someones heart, if you can see someones inside, youll see how evil he/she is. But our God chooses to love us and He loves us just as who we are. He loves us, He loves all the sinners. He would like to die for us. For all the sinners, to wash away our sins and also to give us eternal life, this tells us what love is, what a wonderful and amazing love is.Many years ago, some girls might ask their boyfriends a question like this: If your mother and I dropped into water at the same time, who would you save first? Do you think this question is so stupid, isnt it? Yes. But even for this stupid question, we can see deeply in our heart we wish someone will love us and they will sacrifice they own life to love us. And also for many girls, I heard some senior people give advice to some young people: While looking for a life partner, its better for you to find a man  who can love you more than you love him. And if he loves you more, he will treat you as a treasure, and you will get a very happy life. So for us in our hearts, we are eager to find this kind of love, but who can die for us? Who will love us more than themselves? Only one person, only one God, its our Jesus Christ. From what Jesus Christ has done we know He loves us more than we love Him. We can totally agree with this statement. Jesus Christ loves us more than we love Him. Not only does He love us more, in the meantime, He loves us first. Its not because we love Him first, but Jesus Christ loves us first before we know Him, before we believe in Him. But first He loves us, He loves us to save us. He loves us as we have a lot of sins, when the we are so bad, so sinful, we are so ugly, but God chooses to love us at this time. So dear brothers and sisters, you may have been in some relationships before. Sometimes, you would ask your boyfriend or your girlfriend, why do you love me? Some people may say because you are beautiful, because you are so smart, because you like to help others, because you are so sweet, but no one will say because you are so bad, because you have a lot of sins, so I love you.  No, of course not. But our God, He looks at each of our eyes and says dear, my sweet heart, I love you, I love you as who you are. I love you even though you have a lot of sins, and even though you have some evil thoughts in your heart. But I choose to love you, I love you more than you love me, I love you first, I love you so that Id like to die for you. Id like to save you, Id like to give you eternal life. This is Gods love. So dear brothers and sisters, for all the singles. I want to encourage you, when we experience this kind of love; we could never, ever find another person in this world who can love us as our savior Jesus Christ does. So lets fall in love with Jesus Christ. I want to share two stories with you this morning. One is mine and the other is my sisters story. Its very hard for me to share my story in public, because I feel it was a big hurt, a deep hurt in my heart. So I dont like to share. But this morning, I want to share my own story to testify how God transformed my life. When I was a little child, my mom and dad divorced. Later, my mom told me, when she was pregnant, she thougfht she would have a boy in the future. But unfortunately, when my mom gave her birth, it was a girl. You know in the old days in the countryside, many families hoped to have a son. So after I was born, my dad and my grandma didnt like me at all. My father didnt see me or even hug me in my first month. And after that, they didnt treat my mom very well. My dad and my mom started to fight. In the end, they divorced. So I would think they divorced because of me. Because Im a girl, they didnt like me. I was so bad. I became sensitive and lost security in my heart. So I was eager for fathers love, and I was ashamed to tell others I didnt have a father. When I was in junior high school and high school, I always kept lying to my classmates. I didnt tell them and no one knew I didnt have a father. And I always told myself: Gloria, you are so bad, you are a bad girl, no one would love you, you are not worthy having a happy marriage. You will be single forever. So after I knew God, I started to believe in Him. I prayed, dear Lord, if you really love me, could you please give me a boyfriend? You didnt let me experience what a fathers love is like. Could you please give me a husband to let me feel a fathers love? And from the Bible, from the preaching sermons or the knowledge in the seminary I know, God should be my only satisfaction. But in my heart, I still have hope of getting a boyfriend, its hard to fall in love with Jesus. Its hard to say, to really say, to be honest to say, God is my only satisfaction. I didnt know how to solve this problem. I knew that was a truth, I knew God should be my satisfaction. But it was very hard to apply that truth in my own life. So maybe you cant imagine why I couldnt make God my satisfaction. And you may not understand this. You cant imagine how painful my heart was. How deep hurt my heart has experienced in the past. But God didnt blame me for my wrong heart. He attracted me with His wonderful love. I started to pray for a life partner for years. But He didnt answer. So I doubted. I was very sad. I talked with some Christian friends, and they helped me a lot. Even though I felt there was no difference during that time, actually it was different and God transformed me step by step. First, God helped me make Him Himself my only satisfaction in my life. I still remember last April, I went to Atlanta. I went to a church, and during that worship time, a worship leader sang a song called My Reward. I was touched a lot. And the worship leader sang these sentences nothing can compare with knowing you. Nothing can compare with loving you. Im giving my life to follow you, my King. The worship leader sang those sentences again and again. Suddenly, I felt God was my only satisfaction. I couldnt tell how it worked; I could only say it was the Holy Spirit was working The situation had not changed, but my heart was transformed by God at that moment. And I made a prayer: Lord, nothing can compare with knowing you. Nothing can compare with loving you. Dear Lord, my dear savior, now I want to give my life to follow you, my King. After that, God used several pastors and friends to help me know that God love me so much. God was starting to build my security in my heart in Him. God told me I was so special and precious in His eyes. And some of my friends told me how amazing I was. They prayed for me to remove insecurity in my mind. They helped me discern Satans work and rely on God to overcome it. They told me how special I was in Gods eyes. How amazing and how charming I was in Gods eyes. And God also taught me through a sister.   Previously, many people were encouraging me that I will have a life partner in the future if I have this desire, God will fulfill this desire for me. But that sister told me, Bible never said everyone should be in marriage. Bible never said that. Bible says some will have marriages, and some will be single for the whole life. But for us, let God be the NO.1 place in our life. And He should be in charge of our life. And we should surrender our life to Him. From that, I made a prayer: Lord, if your will is that I will be single for the whole life, I will say yes; if your will is I will have a life partner in the future, I will say yes. Im willing to put you in the position of head, Im willing to let you be the master of my life. So Lord, please help me. I need to obey Him no matter what His will is.Recently, when we prepared to start for this new sermon series, I kept thinking about it: what was the most important thing for singles to prepare for marriage? I think it is that Jesus Christ should be our first love, and we should be building a strong and joyful relationship with Him. But how do we fulfill our longings? The answer is our topic Falling in love with Jesus Christ. We are eager to fall in love with someone else. We are eager to find a life partner to fall in love with him or her. But first, our God teaches us to fall in love with Jesus Christ. So from the Bible, we know we always describe church is the bride of Jesus Christ. And Christ is the bridegroom. But how many of us think we are the bride of Jesus Christ. We are the most beautiful bride of Jesus Christ in this world. How many of us we think in this way? How many of you put yourself, not the church but your individual,  as the most beautiful bride of Christ in this world? Its personal and individual; you are the most beautiful bride of Christ in this world. Who is the bride of the Savior, the bride of the one who loves us and sacrifices himself for you; whod love to lay down his life for you; whod love to save you and give the eternal life to you; whod love to give himself to you, do you want to be his most beautiful, wonderful and amazing bride in this world? So I would like to encourage you to meditate how to be Jesus Christs most beautiful bride in this world, and how to start to fall in love with Him?The other testimony is from a sisters story, and I was touched a lot when she shared with me. She has been learning how to put God into the NO.1 position, and how to fall in love with Jesus Christ, and she also knew the truth from the Bible and Christians that she should put Jesus Christ as her first love, but still she was praying for a life partner or a boyfriend. For the first time she met a non-Christian, she fell in love with him, but it did bot go very well because of the non-Christian. At that time, a wise sister talked to her, my friend, I want to pray for you, you will break up with him, because you are all not on the same level. And in the end, they broke up. Did she get hurt? Yes absolutely, and with a broken heart. Then, the sister said to herself that I will be looking for a boyfriend in Christ next time. And several months later, she met a Christian, but they did not plan to start going into a relationship, they broke up as well, and this time she got hurt more. She asked, why God? Isnt it a Christian? Why do you end this relationship? And I obey you this time. But one day she got over the pain after they broke up, because she felt her friend did not really love her. Even he did not say I love you during their dating time, she felt so painful and sad. At that moment, these pains reminded her how painful was Jesus Christ on the cross. When Jesus was on the cross, many people did not believe in him, millions of people did not love him, and this sister thought that she was so painful just for one person, but Jesus Christ faced to the millions of people; there was much greater pain than she experienced. So from then on, she decided to truly love the Lord with all her heart, all her mind, all her body and all her soul, just like Matthew 22:37  says. So that day, she made Jesus as her first love, and learnt to tell Jesus Christ I love you. These are  the sweetest words in this world. She just really paid her attention to the Lord, she fell in love with Him, and now shes married happily to a Christian with two children. It also reminds me that Jesus Christ died on the cross for me.Last Sunday the worship team sang a song named Here I am to worship, it goes like this: Ill never know how much it costs to see my sins upon that cross. When I sang this sentence, I started to cry. Ive never known how much Jesus Christ has paid for me, Ive never understood how painful it was on that cross, so I prayed to God:  Dear Heavenly Father, my dear Savior, I do want to marry you, I do want to fall in love with you from now on; and I do want to be your bride and learn how to be your beautiful bride; I do want to get your love, and respond to your love at this moment. So dear brother and sister and dear friends, if you are still single, start to fall in love with Christ. I do not know what Gods will for you, you may have a life partner soon, but first fall in love with Jesus Christ; you may be single for your whole life, but first fall in love with Jesus Christ, for He is very handsome and secure man in this world to have. Some of you may have already entered into a relationship, but may not fall in love with Jesus Christ; I truly encourage you to fall in love with Him. Some of you may have been married for years, but you never thought about you are the bride of Jesus Christ, so I want to challenge you to fall in love with Christ Jesus from today, from this moment. Some of you may have experienced deep hurts as I did, you may not have any confidence or hope for marriage, you may question God the reason. You may have a very spiritual life but could not understand why that person still has not appeared, but have you ever thought that you are the bride of Jesus Christ? Have you already put yourself into this precious and special role? So I would like to encourage you to stop planning or dreaming, but allow the Lord to give you the life partner, try to love Him crazy, try to treat Him as your bridegroom, try to treat Him as your first love, try to taste how He loves you, try to taste His love. In the book Crazy Love by Frances Chan,  it mentions: The best news- the best news in the world, in fact- is that you can have God Himself. Do you believe that God is the greatest thing you can experience in the whole world? Do you believe that the Good News is not merely the forgiveness of your sins, the  guarantee that you wont  go to hell, or the promise of life in heaven? The best things in life are gifts from the One who  steadfastly loves you. But an important question to ask ourselves is this: are we in love with God? Or just as His staff?What a beautiful gift is to have the one you love, look you in the eyes and say: I love you, not your beauty, your money, your family or your car, just you. Can you say this to God? Can you say Dear Lord I love you; Not because you will wash away my sins, you will give me a blessing, or you will give me the eternal life, just you, Lord, I love you just because who you are. So I want to say the best gift you have ever got is that you have God Himself, its not that you can get eternal life, but you are able to fall in love with Jesus Christ our Savior. Our Saviors love is the most wonderful, beautiful and amazing love story in this world. No one will die for you but Jesus Christ did, no one will love you more than themselves because all of us are selfish, but our Savior loves us more than we love Him. Our God not only loves us more than we love Him, but He chooses to love us first, invites us to love Him and fall in love with him. How much He loves us and what a wonderful love it is!Our God today is encouraging us: My dear children, my dear beautiful bride, I am waiting for your love, I am waiting for you to fall in love with me. I am waiting for you to make a decision to marry me, I will protect you, I will save you, I will care about you, I will love you unconditionally, no matter who you are, no matter healthy or sick, rich or poor, beautiful or ugly, I love you just for who you are. I hope we can love Him back, and if we really love him, He will be our satisfaction and we can find security in Him, only He can give this to us. So if you want to make a decision, could you please bow down your heads and we pray together? Dear Heaven Father, my dear Savior, my dear bridegroom, at this moment we come to you, we want to marry you, we want to fall in love with you, we want to make the most holy  promise to you. O Lord, please help us taste your love, your wonderful love. Please help us fall in love with you to taste the most beautiful wonderful, amazing and charming love story in the world. May you be our first love, may you be our first life partner, may you be our bridegroom, and we shall be satisfied with your love, we shall be happy in you, and we shall only depend on you in this world. Lord helps us, be with us, may your love fill our hearts, and we will enjoy the time with you and we pray in Jesus Name. Amen"
"48","20120805eng","2012-08-05","Jessica Wang","Loving & Serving each other","1 Peter 4:8-10","By Pastor WangAug 05 2012Loving and Serving Each OtherWorship leader Carols prayer:Jesus, thank you for this morning. Thank you for loving us first. Thank you for being such a good example to teach us how to love and serve one another. Lord, please draw us closer to you, to be more and more like you. In Jesus name, Amen.Today's scripture reading is from I Peter 4:8-10.8 Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.9 Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.10 Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.Today's Sermon topic is ""Loving and Serving Each Other"". The sermon will be given by Pastor Wang.Sermon:Good morning, my dear brothers and sisters. How about letting us bow down and pray together?Dear Lord, thank you so much for you love us so deeply that we can be adopted by you as your children. Lord, thank you so much for your blood, so that we can be cleaned. Lord, thank you so much for your love, so we'll know and feel how we can love others and serve others. Lord, we want to lift up all the brothers and sisters here in your hands and myself in your hands. Please teach us, let us understand your love, your deep love. Let us feel this and let us act this out in our daily life. We pray in Jesus name. Amen!Pastor Jessicas Sermon:Dear brothers and sisters, I accepted Jesus when I was very young, four or five years (old). Since I got to know Him and I know that he loves me so deeply, and I know that only in Jesus Christ, can I be satisfied. However, sometimes I still feel weak, especially when I think I am lonely, I am alone, I am very weak. So I want to share my own experience when I was single. I remember three years ago, I was very struggling about my own situation. Because I thought I was old enough, but I couldn't find my Mr. Right. So one day, when I attended a worship service in Southern California, I felt very terrible. I felt I was alone. I felt that God could answer my prayer about Church, about others, but God could not hear my prayer about my own situation. During that service, the pastor asked all of us to pray for each other even you did not know them. So I prayed for my neighbour. And after the service, one of the sisters came to me and I even did not know her. It's the first time I attended that church and also it's the first time I met her. I am sorry for now I could not remember her name, but she told me, During the prayer time, I prayed for you. And I know that Lord loves you, our Jesus loves you and He knows your thought, your situation and your feeling. So dear brothers and sisters, I was very touched by what she said. The Lord Jesus Christ drew me near to Him through that sisters prayer and encouraged me. Let me know that He still loves me and cares for me and cares for what I need. Introduction:So dear brothers and sisters, today we are going to use I Peter 4:8-10 to share the topic  Loving and Serving Each Other. Last Sunday, we studied a Love sermon series. Gloria talked about Falling in Love with Jesus. So we must start by receiving God unconditional love for each other. We should let Him be our satisfaction and love Him with all our heart, our soul, our mind and our strength. I think this is the first step in preparation for dating and marriage. The important thing in our life is to love God. And our loving relationship with God will result in our loving others. So today we are going to go to the second step  loving and serving one another. No matter whether we are single or married, we need to know how to love each other and serve each other. So today is the second step for preparing for dating and marriage -- loving and serving each other.I Peter 4:8 tells us that the important thing is to love others deeply. So it says that,Above all, love each other deeply.So the first point I will share with you is that ""love each other deeply"". But what is love? How can we love each other deeply? Before I started to date, I was expecting a romantic kind of love. For me, this meant that he, my boyfriend, would have to love me always, serve me always, buy me gifts always. So I don't know, dear sisters, what you thoughts are. And he will show his love in romantic ways. I: Three Types of LoveBut actually, in fact, love must be deeper than that. So there are many different ways to understand love and show love to each other on earth. Earthly, thinking about love and showing love to others or understanding love may have three types of thinking. One is that, If you love me, then I love you. If you hate me, then I hate you. This kind of love has a weak foundation. If this foundation changes, love will change. It can not last very long. Second, If you love me, then I love you. If you hate me, then I will not hate you. But I will not love you anymore. This is much better than last one, but also this kind of love could not last either. Third, If you love me, then I love you. If you do not love me, then I will still love you. I will love you unconditionally. What do you think which kind of love is this? If you still remember, you will know that this is Christs love, in Greek, we call it agape love. Only Jesus Christ can love us unconditionally. And also, as a follower of Jesus Christ, we need to learn this kind of love, and also we need to practise this in our daily life by the power of our Lord. II: Doxology of LoveSo there is one scripture I love the most, it is I Corinthian 13:4-8. I call it the great song of agape love. It says that,Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.i: Love is Patient.So it is talking about agape love. This song shows 15 characters of love. Because time is limited, I will just share with you two of them to understand what agape love is. First, agape love is patient. It means long serving. The fruit of the Holy Spirit is patience. Only when the Holy Spirit works in our heart, can we be patient. Otherwise, we could not have patience. So let our Lord Jesus Christ work in our heart, especially for those who are single .Be patient, waiting for your love, or loving others. And also let all married men or women be patient with your wife or husband. Only when the Holy Spirit works in our hearts can we be  patient.I remember one day one sister shared with me about her own experience about patience. I was very touched by what she said. We all have this kind of experience. But if I were her, I would not do that. But what she shared with me really touched my heart. She told me it took her more than 20 minutes to transfer from one line to another line in a subway station. Dear brothers and sisters, have you ever experienced this? We know that in Beijing, it is very crowded. Every morning and evening, we have to suffer from transferring in subway station, railway station or bus stop. She said, although there was such a huge crowd of people, she did not feel bored or tired. Guess! What did she do during that time? She told me that she prayed for those people around her and she gave thanks to our God for giving her that great opportunity. She said, Even though I did not know those people, but I still thanked God for giving me these precious 20 minutes to walk with them and pray for them. Dear brothers and sisters, what is that? That is patience! Because our Lord Jesus loves us, so he has patience for all of us. Even though we sin against Him, He still loves us and waits for us to go back to Him. Because this sister experienced Gods love for her, she can have patience and pray for others she does not know even in such bad situations. Love is patient. Love can produce patience. ii: Love is Kind.Second, love is kind. Kind means gentle and merciful. Someone uses this acronym to understand what means to be kind. K stands for knowledge; I stands for investment; N stands for need; D stands for decision. What does that mean? That means we must start by getting to know others, especially, to know their needs.Then, if we know that being kind requires us to invest our time, energy, and money in response to the needs of others. To be kind, we need to focus on others rights rather than ourselves. In addition, to be kind is not only to have knowledge of knowing others needs, but also needs us to act it out through our decisions in our daily life. That is kind! Dear brothers and sisters, being kind is not something in your mind. We must be willing to know others needs and we must turn it into actions by investing our love, time, money and energy to fulfill others needs. So dear brothers and sisters, before you start to look for your Mr. Right or Mrs. Right, I am praying for you that you prepare yourself in our Lord Jesus Christ to be kind, to be patient, to be good to yourself and to others and love others. There are so many things about love in I Corinthians chapter 13. I cannot share all of them. However, it reminds us that we should know and understand what love is, we can love others, then we can find our love partners of our life. But how can we apply those in our daily life? There is a way. Today, I would like to invite all of us to apply it using I Corinthians chapter 13. Please replace the word love with your name. Also, this is what one sister shared with me. She always checks herself (to see) if she loves others or not. Let us try together and check us if we really love others or not. And we can also check ourselves if we love God or not. Replace love with your name. Replace I with my name. Lets read it together. After you read this passage, you will know what you need, and what you should be like? I was ashamed of myself when I read it (replaced love) with my name. But I want to check it myself and I also want to invite you to check it yourselves. Lets start. Remember, replace love with your name, replace I with my name, Read loudly! One, two, three, begin! Jessica is patient, Jessica is kind. Jessica dose not envy, Jessica does not boast, Jessica is not proud. Jessica is not rude, Jessica is not self-seeking, Jessica is not easily angered; Jessica keeps no records of wrongs. Jessica does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. Jessica always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always preserves. Tell me your feelings. After I read this, I should confess my sins to our Lord Jesus Christ, because I am not patient, I am not kind, I do not always protect, I do not always hope, I do not always trust.There is a scripture in the Bible which tells us that Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love to one another, for he who loves his fellowmen has fulfilled the law (Romans 13:8). On our PowerPoint we have the scripture. I will speak it in Chinese for more to understand it. 813Let us remember that we have a continuing debt to love each other. III: Love Covers Sins.Thirdly, love covers over a multitude of sins. When we read this scripture which is from I Peter chapter 4 verse 8 .It does not mean that our love can cover our sins against God, but the truth is that there is only one whose love can cover our sins against God. He is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christs love covers our sins, and He paid for our sins by dying on the cross. Thats how He showed His love for us. Dear brothers and sisters, we are all loved by our Lord Jesus Christ, no matter who we are, no matter what kind of situation we are facing, no matter how bad we are, our Lord Jesus Christ covers all this, and He paid for all of us, and He loves and accepts us. He showed His love by dying on the cross for us, by adopting us to be His own children. He showed His love by forgiving and forgetting our sins. In I John Chapter 4 verse 9-10, Bible tells us,This is how God showed His love among us: He sent His one and only Son into the world that we might live through Him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.We are human beings. We are always weak and we are limited. Sometimes, we would love the ones who are lovely, but we do not love the ones who are not lovely. Then how can we change our attitude? How can we love each other deeply? We should remember that how God loves us. Our Lord commands us, You should love one another, because I have already loved you. We love because our Lord Jesus Christ loves us first. So dear brothers and sisters, let us love each other deeply in our daily life and understand what love is. After I read I Corinthians Chapter 13, I got to know that in my loving relationship, what I expected from my boy friend was wrong. So, I took some other actions. Before I got married, I and my husband (to-be, fianc) went to buy marriage rings. We decided to inscribe scripture on them. You could not see it, but the scripture is inside the ring, and also you will also see our names. So, guess what we inscribed on the rings? It is LNE, which means Love Never Ends. It reminds us that we could not make our love lasting forever just by our own selves. This scripture is from I Corinthians, Love Never Ends. It reminds us that we need to be patient to each other; we must be kind to each other; we must protect each other; we must trust each other and we must hope with each other even if we might quarrel with each other.So, each time when I see the ring, it will remind me that it is love. So what I am expecting is not bad things, and I should learn from the Bible and change my mind and my attitude. And my husband will do this the same.IV: Serving others and the LordFourth, serve each other and serve the Lord together. 1 Peter chapter 4, verses 9 to 10 tell us that,9Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.10Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of Gods grace in its various forms.These words tell us that (we should) serve each other and the Lord with the gifts that He gives us. I believe that everyone has the special gifts that only you have, that you can use to serve others and the Lord. So dear brothers and sisters, think about it and pray about it, what kind of gifts does God give to you? So, do not admire others; do not say that I am so weak. I am nothing. I cannot do this, I cannot do that.; I am not like Carol because she could lead the worship. Do not think in that way, because the Bible says that the Lord has given each of us different gifts, we can use these gifts to serve others and the Lord together. The Lord works through us to meet others needs. When we read the Bible and we will find out that in Ruth, there is a romantic loving account about Ruth and Boaz. Through this account, we know that Boaz was the one who loved to serve others for the sake of the name of God. If you know about this Old Testament account, you will know that Boaz became aware of Ruth when he saw her gleaning in his field. And after he learned that, he asked others to give her extra food and what she needed, not only physically but also emotionally. In the end, they got married. Their son is the grandfather of King David.So dear brothers and sisters, when we get to know this, we should use our time, our precious time, not just waiting for the ones (in need) to come to us, not just waiting for your Mr. or Mrs. Right, but treasure your single time to equip yourselves and serve one another and the Lord. No matter if you are single or married, we must treasure our time to serve the Lord and to serve others, using the gifts the Lord gives us.I also have this experience of serving the Lord and serving others together and getting to know my husband before he became my husband. I think this is the best way to get to know each other; this is the best way to build a very beautiful relationship and friendship. Jessicas sharing of her relationship:I remember two years ago, on Christmas, I was asked to preach at one of our meeting places. My husband, his name is Li, was asked to take photos of me on that early Christmas morning. Before that, I just knew his name, but I did not know who he was, or what kind of person he was. But through that morning service together, I got to know that he was very kind, and also he was the one who loved the Lord so deeply, and he was the one who wanted to use his gifts to serve our Lord as a photographer. Through his serving, I had a good impression of him. The next time we met together was when I was visiting a girl who was a leukaemia patient. She had to leave Beijing for a while to go back to her hometown. But because she was so weak, she could not take the public transportation to go to the Beijing Railway Station, and she needed to ask someone to take her there. But I was not a good driver, especially I do not have sense of directions. So I asked my real (biological) brother to take her to the railway station. But on the afternoon, he told me that, Sister, sorry, I could not help her because I have some other emergency to deal with. At that time, it made me think of Li. Only four hours left before I had to make a decision to ask him if he could come and serve in this way. I rememberat that time when he served with me, he told me one sentence that, Jessica, if you have anything that you need help with, just let me know two hours earlier, then I can come.This made me think of him, so I called him, and he came. And we together took this sister to the Beijing Railway Station. When we got back home, it was later than 11pm. Through this, I got to know that he did not only treat me well; he did not only treat our God well; but he was also treating others well, even this very weak girl. So in the end, we got married. (Applause.)So dear brothers and sisters, I just want to encourage you, use your precious time to serve the Lord and others. And this is the best way to get to know other brothers and sisters. I will try to make this church a place for all the singles, and try to make you serve together. But there is one thing that I want to remind you of. Dear brothers and sisters, when you start to serve the Lord and others, your purpose is not to seek your own desires. Like what we have learned today, seek His kingdom and His righteousness first, and all these things will be given to you. (Matthew 6:33) Dear brothers and sisters, this is what I share with you  loving and serving each other; loving and serving our Lord. May God bless all of us.Transcribed and edited by Hui Ren, Cuicui Wang, Franz and Liu Laoshi with the love from our Lord Jesus Christ. PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 1"

Amen.RecapFirst week of the series - Falling in love with Jesus ChristSo do you still remember that three weeks ago, our church English fellowship started a new sermon series which is called The Love sermon series. So three weeks ago, we had the first teaching on this new sermon series. How many of you attended that Sunday service three weeks ago? How many of you? Could you please raise your hands if you attended that service and listened to the (first sermon of The) Love sermon series? If you were here, could you please raise your hands? Do you still remember what the topic was? I heard, Falling in love with Jesus Christ. In that sermon, I highlighted that we could be the most beautiful bride of Jesus Christ in this world. We could have the most amazing, wonderful, romantic and crazy love story with our Lord, Savior, Jesus Christ in this world. If you marry Jesus, if you fall in love with Him, you could get the most beautiful, amazing love story in this world. And I encouraged you, I challenged all of you who were here three weeks ago to fall in love with Jesus Christ.Do you still remember this? And have you been trying to fall in love with our Savior, because only He could lay down His own life for us. And when we sang How Great Thou Art, we hear how great our God was. He created such a beautiful world for us. He created such beautiful mountains, sea, sky and some different places, and when we see these places, we sing how great thou art.But can you image we have a lot of sins? But God still endures us. We see we are so bad; we are so evil inside of us. But our Savior still came to the world, to love us, to forgive us, for He fell in love with us first. So when you see this, when you see how bad we are, and how God loves us, we can say, Lord, you are so great! How great you are! How great you are that you can love a person like me. Second week of the series - Loving and serving each otherSo do you still remember the second teaching of this new sermon series, which was shared by Pastor Jessica? Do you still remember? How many of you were here two weeks ago, who attended the service? Could you please raise your hands? Did you remember what the topic was on that Sunday? Did you remember at that sermon, Jessica encouraged and challenged us to replace the word love with our own name in that love song. Do you remember that? Yes, and her topic was Loving and serving each other. So she shared the scripture of I Corinthians 13:4-7, which is the most beautiful love song in the whole Bible. And Paul said in that chapter,Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.And I still remember when I replaced my name into this love song, and I said this with all the people who were here two weeks ago, and I said, Gloria is patient, Gloria is kind, Gloria does not envy, Gloria does not boast, Gloria is not proud, Gloria is not rude, Gloria is not self-seeking, Gloria is not easily angered, Gloria keeps no record of wrongs. Gloria does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. Gloria always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.When I did that, I felt so sad; I felt so ashamed of myself. When I replaced my name into that love song, I felt I had no love at all. I did not love at all. I needed to practice love in my whole life. Sometimes, love is not easy to anger. But for me, I am very easily angered. Love is patient, but in many situations, for some troubles, it is very easy for me not to be patient. But, we need to practice love in our whole life. Today we will continue this new Love sermon series. We go on into the third teaching of this new sermon series. Its talking about Becoming the person God wants you to be.And at first I want to show you a short video. In this video, one brother and one sister will share what they think about who they are, and how they pursue to become the person God wants them to be. Lets watch the video first.Playing videoFor all of us here, we have different views on how to be the person God wants us to be. So today we will discuss how to become the person God wants you to be. First, I would like to ask you several questions. Becoming a person whom you are not?Have you ever wanted to become the person your parents want you to be? I know for some young people, in their lives, they just wanted to become the persons their parents want them to be. They would do everything just to meet their parents needs. They would go to a university or choose a major in a university just to satisfy their parents. They would study very hard just to please their parents and make them happy, or just to make the parents proud of them. And for some of you, you want to become the person your friends want you to be. Or if you are dating, have you tried to become the person your boyfriend or girlfriend wants you to be? Or if you are married, have you tried to become the person your husband or your wife wants you to be? For some of you who are working, have you tried to become the person that pleases your boss. For some of you who are still in college, have you tried to become the person to please your classmates or your teachers?I think some of you here have experienced this. And we want to become the person someone else wants us to be. We live for someone else. But sometimes, when we become this kind of person, we will be confused; sometimes, when we will feel so torn, we will get worn out. Because we cannot achieve what they expect for us, we think we are useless and worthless in this world. The desires to please others put a lot of pressure in our life. Because many people have wrong values for life, they do not really know their true identity and whom they should live for. From the TV, from the website, we could see the rate of suicide has grown very rapidly in recent years. And when you open the website, open the TV news, you could see some people kill themselves; even some students in different universities, no matter it is Peking University, famous universities, or less famous universities. For some college students, they could not stand so much pressure, so they fall down from tall buildings and finish their lives. When we hear this news, we feel so sad. Satan is the one who tries to put out the light in our life; Satan is saying to us,You should live for this person; you should live for that person; you have to live for so much money and your life would be full of happiness; you should work harder and harder; and you should please all the people around you.Becoming the person God wants us to beSatan tries to deceive you. But dear brothers and sisters, dear friends, it is time for us to turn away from this life, and to know the truth from the Bible. The truth is that our purpose is to please God, not any one in this world. The purpose, why we are created by God, the motivation of God creating us is to glorify Him, to please Him only; to please the Most High; to please Him who died for us, saved us, who gave us eternal life to please Him only.So, we must pursue to become the person God wants us to be. As our reading Scripture, II Corinthians 5:17 says,Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: the old has gone, the new is here!We are saved by Christ. Here, we know that we are not only saved by Christ, but He also gave us a huge promise that we could be in Him. We are in HIM. Do you know that you are a new person in Christ; you are a new creation in Christ. So you can have a new life; your old life has gone; your new life will come. Therefore, you no longer need to become the person your parents want you to be; you no longer need to become the person your husband, or wife, or boyfriend, or girlfriend, or your boss, or your classmate, or your friend wants you to be. You only need to become the person God wants you to be. You only need to pursue to become the person our God wants you to be.Instead of trying to find the right person, we need to focus on becoming the new life, men or women, God wants us to be. This must be our priority. This must be something we should seek and pursue. When we know our true identity, we are new persons in Christ; we are new creations in Christ; when (we believe that) on His cross, in His redemption on the cross, Jesus died and was raised three days later, we should have a new life. We could be created by Him again. We should let our new life grow faster inside of us.Marys obedience to GodNow, we are going to focus on two figures from the Bible. And from them, we will know how each of them became the person God wanted them to be. The first person is Mary, the mother of Jesus. Like the sister shared in the video. Mary used her whole life to tell us what obedience was. Why the sister liked Mary is because Mary obeyed God. When we see Mary, we know that she was a common lady in that society in the first century. We know that Mary had already found her life partner, and was ready to get married soon. Mary and Joseph were already engaged before her life was going to be totally different. So Mary and Joseph were preparing to share their lives together soon. Mary and Joseph loved each other very much, and they loved God. From the gospel of Matthew, Mary found a very good husband. Matthew wrote that Joseph, Marys husband-to-be (fianc) was a righteous man, a good man (Matthew 1:19). Mary and Joseph were looking forward to a happy life. But one day, one angel came, and a huge event came into their lives, and Joseph and Marys lives became totally different because of this event. One day, an angel came to Mary, and said to her,Greetings, you who are highly  favored! The Lord is with you Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. (Luke 1:28-31)Wait, what? Who am I? How will this be since I am a virgin? Mary asked the angel, How will this be? I havent married Joseph yet. How can I have a child?The angel answered, The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.Wow, can you imagine this? Try to picture this. One day, when you are on your phone, an angel came to you, she said, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, so the holy one to be born will be called the Son of GodDo you think it crazy, dont you? So, if an angel came to me and said to me, even though I am a Christian and I love God, I might use my theology, I might use my logic, thinking, Is she really an angel from God? Or do I hear the sound from Satan? Who am I? Can I be pregnant by (the presence of) the Holy Spirit and I can give birth to a son, and His name will be Jesus, He will be the Son of God. Wow, it is unbelievable. It is very hard to believe, isnt it? It is really unusual; it is out of our normal thinking; it cannot be done; it cannot be fulfilled; it is wrong. If someone came to you and said some crazy words, the first reaction you have is to think that the person has some mental problems, so he would say these words. But what was Marys reaction? She said,I am the Lords servant. May your word to me be fulfilled. (Luke 1:38)Do you think that Marys friends would believe that she was moved by the Holy Spirit, and that was how she got pregnant? I do not think so. They might ask, Mary, are you crazy? Who do you think you are that you will be pregnant by the Holy Spirit? Do you have some problems that you can be full of the Holy Spirit? No, not at all.She would be mocked for her whole life, people would always be gossiping about her. After she gave birth to the child, maybe some people would say that this baby was not from Joseph. Maybe Mary did something wrong and she had a baby with some other people, so she said the baby was from the Holy Spirit. So Mary had to bear such a big suffering in her whole life. And the Holy Spirit made Mary pregnant. Many people would say it was so ridiculous. But Mary, because she loved the Lord  much, she knew Gods calling and she only needed to live for God only, so even though people could not understand, even though she needed to bear such a great suffering, she was willing to say,Yes, Lord, I am your servant. May it be to me as you have said.Even though her life would be totally different, full of mocking and gossips, but she was willing to say,Yes, Lord My soul glorifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior, for He has been mindful of the humble state of His servant. From now on, all generations will call me blessed. (Luke 1:46-47)Instead of complaining about the sufferings she had to face, she said,My soul will rejoice in my God, my Savior.That is because she did not focus on her own sufferings, but on Gods kingdom. And she looked at her sufferings as something so small. In her spirit, she could rejoice. She knew of Gods power and plan for her, and she was willing to fulfill Gods calling in her whole life. And she did not care about others gossips or mocking.Pauls life for ChristAnother example from the Bible is the apostle Paul. Because of time limit, I will only talk on this briefly.From the accounts of the apostle Paul, I really like this man from the Bible. Although he did not get married in his life, he could write the most beautiful love song in the Bible. He said, Love is patient; love is kind (I Corinthians 13).  Paul used to persecute many Christians. But on the way to Damascus, Paul was transformed by God. So Paul said,I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven. (Acts 26:19)What is this vision Paul was talking about? Paul was travelling from Jerusalem to Damascus, he suddenly saw a blinding light from heaven, he heard a voice, and he asked,Who are you, Lord?Then the voice answered,I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I will show you. I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me. (Acts 26:16-18)This is Pauls vision from God, this is Pauls calling from God. And he used his whole life to fulfill Gods calling in this world. He knew Gods calling for his life, so he was able to bear so much suffering. The center of his life is Jesus Christ. He knew the only one he should try to please is Jesus Christ, not any one else. When he wrote a letter to the Romans, he could say,Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of Gods mercy, to offer your body as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God - this is your true and proper worship.2Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what Gods will is his good, pleasing and perfect will. (Romans 12:1-2)We know that in the Old Testament, Israelites would offer animals to be sacrificed to God. And in the New Testament, God asks us to be living sacrifices for Him. Living sacrifice means that we will have to live our whole life in service to God, to please Him. Living for God is our true worship. We come to church every Sunday, but the service to God does not only include attending church on Sundays. Instead, it is what we do everyday. If we live for God everyday, we are becoming the person God wants us to be. We are no longer living to please others, because in Romans 12:2, it says,Do not conform to the pattern of this world,The pattern of this world is to please your friends, your parents, your girlfriends, your boyfriends, your husbands, your wives. This is being conformed to this world. But being transformed by God is to live to please Him, is to pursue to become the person God wants you to be. And Paul really offered his body as a living sacrifice. He lived only for God; he pursued to please God alone; he became the person God wanted him to be; he knew he was a servant of God; he knew that as a servant of God, he should seek Gods kingdom and righteousness first. So from these two examples in the Bible, we can know how to become the person God wants us to be.The first one is to know our identity; second, to know Gods calling; third, to seek Gods kingdom and righteousness first. For Mary, she knew what her identity was; her identity is a servant of God, to obey whatever God has told her. And Gods calling for Mary is to give birth to Jesus Christ. Mary knew this calling and she was willing to fulfill this calling. And for Paul, he knew he was a servant of God (too), and he was willing to be the apostle to the Gentiles. And this is his calling from God. And he was willing to use his whole life as the apostle to the Gentiles. For both of them, they sought Gods kingdom and righteousness first. And because of this, they were willing to obey God. They were willing to be living sacrifices to God. So how about us? Dear brothers and sisters. Do you know what kind of person God wants you to be? If you have known this, and you are in the process of accomplishing Gods calling in your life, I encourage you to keep on doing this. If you have known Gods calling, you have known your true and new identity in Christ, but you have not done it yet, I encourage you to start doing it today. For some of you, you are not sure what kind of person God wants you to be; what Gods calling for you is, I encourage you to ask Him, to come to Him and keep seeking Him until you know Gods calling for you, because God gives different callings to His children. We do not have the same calling, but we will all be used by God. For some of you here, you are still looking for a life partner. I want to encourage and challenge you, before you find the life partner, seek Gods kingdom and righteousness first. First, to think about what we are living for; first, to think about what kind of person God wants me to be and do. Keep on thinking about this, and applying it to your life, and asking for Gods vision for you, for your whole life. And if you become the person God wants you to be, you will have a happy life, no matter what the situation is, no matter if you will be single or have a life partner, a marriage or not. Because you are living only for Him, and He is your satisfaction, and you will find satisfaction in Him. So I encourage you to think about how to become the person God wants you to be, and really ask Him for this. Lets pray as I close.Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for giving us your Word. Thank you for letting us know that we are new people in you, the old has gone and the new has come. Lord, may your Word be memorized in our hearts. Lord, let us seek to become the person you want us to be. Help us have a new life in you. Lord, help us understand your Word and calling, and respond to your calling in our whole life, live out your calling, use our whole life to fight what you want us to fight, and run the race you give us. Lord, be with us, and keep blessing us, and keep revealing yourself to us. We pray in your name. Amen.Transcribed and edited by Esther and Franz, and Liu Laoshi, grace and love from our Lord Jesus. Amen. PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 1"
"50","20120826eng","2012-08-26","Pastor Wu","Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days","John 2:18-25","2012826Sermon Title: Destroy this Temple, and I will raise it again in three days.Teaching Delivered by: Pastor WuI love the song we just sang, because it tells us how great our Lord is, how great our Lord has been, how great He is when I am in the valley, and how great He is when I am on high. So I love that song, I love to give thanks to our worship leader and the worship team, because of the Holy Spirit, and also the effort from them. Every Sunday, brothers and sisters at this church are brought to the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, so Id love to give thanks to them, and also give glory and praise to the Holy Spirit, and that Jesus Christ would die for us on the cross. Brothers and sisters, we just read John 2, let me repeat part of which we just read. Let me repeat what verses I am going to focus on: Chapter 2, verse 18 Then the Jews demanded of him, ""What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"" Jesus answered or urged them, ""Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."" The Jews replied, ""It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"" But the temple He had spoken of was his body. After He was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what He had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken. Now while He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the miraculous signs He was doing and believed in his name. These people believed in Jesus as a result of being able to see the miracles done by Jesus, they saw it so they believed in Jesus. As a result of this, Bible continue to tell us in verse 24, But Jesus would not entrust himself to them. Brothers and sisters, when Jesus came to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast, what He was seeing at the temple area really angered Him, to such a degree that He made a whip out of chords, and with which He drove out people who was selling doves, lamps, cattle, he was so angry that He overturn the table of the money changers, and he scattered the money of these people, He rebuilt them by saying How dare you! You have turned my fathers house into a market! He was so angry, so He did all of this. After that, the Jews, demand of Jesus, What a miraculous sign you can show us to prove your authority to do all of this? Jesus told them, urged them, Destroy this temple, and I will raise it in three days. The temple, we all know, was the body of Jesus Christ. We all know it was about the resurrection of Jesus Christ. But brothers and sisters, I want to ask you a question today, what kind of temple that Jesus Christ, upon the question raised by the Jews, what kind of temple did Jesus urge Jews to destroy? What kind of people would Jesus Christ not entrust His life to? The Jews came to Jerusalem for Passover Feast. They were all required by the laws, the rules set up by the Jewish priest, that they must bring the first born of the animals they raised at home. They must bring either dove if you are poor, or lambs or cattle if you are rich. You are supposed to bring all of this to the temple as a sacrifice, and also you need to give a tenth of what you get to the temple, so that you can fulfill your duty as a Jew. But because many Jews live so far away from Jerusalem, the priest gave them an easy way for them to fulfill their duty by allowing people to sell cattle, doves and lambs outside the temple area. So people who came to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast, to fulfill their religious duty, all they needed to do is to buy something and to give it to the priest who can slaughter it as a sacrifice. All a Jew is supposed to do is to change the money from Romans money or Egyptian money or other area money into Jews money, so that they can give it to temple. All they need to do is to do this. So the Jewish priest give them an easy way to carry out their religious duty.It reminds me of a fast-food religion. Brothers and sisters, when you go to McDonalds, when you go to Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), when you go to 7-11, all you need to do is to pull out your money, the bill and give it to the cashier, you take your things and leave. Take your food and your dumplings. And the cashier does not care if you are OK, does not care if you are OK. And the cashier do not care if you are struggling in your spiritual growth. And the cashier does not ask even ""Have you been OK recently? Are you OK in the battle against evil?"" They do not care at all. All they need to do is to pull out the money and show it to the cashier. In America and many other countries, when people want some food from McDonalds, what they often to do is to drive in and speak to the speaker: ""I want a hamburger......I want two pieces of chicken......Or I want big-size Cola, I want a medium-size French fries.""And then they drive in again at the window, an arm reaches out, you take the food, and drive home and eat it. You fulfill paying the bill and get your food to eat. Brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ was urging people to tear down the temple where people worship the Lord carelessly, unconcernedly. And Jesus said, ""I would not entrust my life to these people."" He would not entrust His life to people who do not care about their spiritual growth, do not care whether the Lord is with him. Brothers and sisters, you come to church because your mother is a Christian. You come to church because your parents have been bringing you to church in the last five years. Because your parents want you come here, but your heart is in Disneyland. Jesus Christ would not entrust himself to these people. Brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ not only would not entrust himself to this kind of people, to this kind of temple, but also, He would not entrust himself to a legalist person. He would encourage people to destroy the temple where people worship the Lord with their mouths, worship the Lord legalistically by obeying the rules, by obeying the laws, the traditional laws. In the John Chapter 5, Jesus saw a person who was paralyzed for 38 years, so he asked the person, ""Do you want to be healed?"" This person said, ""When angel came down in last 38 years, stirred up the water, the other people who were always able to move jumped to the water before me. So I had never got a chance to be healed."" And Jesus asked him again, ""Do you want to be healed?""And he said, ""Yes, I do."" Jesus commanded him, ""Take your quilt and leave.""And this person did it. But the Pharisees blamed him because what he was doing was on Sabbath. Because he picked up his quilt on the Sabbath. By Jewish laws or rules, they were not supposed to do these things on the Sabbath Day. But the grace of Jesus Christ was upon him on Sabbath Day. Brothers and sisters, I'd like to weigh which is more important: the grace of Lord upon this person or obeying the rules. I am sure your answer would be the grace of Lord with people is more important than rules. I remember one day I was by the side of the door of this church. Two young men were entering the church with shorts and sandals. And the laymanstopped them and told them, ""Well, you guys are not supposed to enter the church with sandals and shorts because it does not look good. Our church does not allow these people to walk into the church.You have to dress yourself up, wear decent clothes because you come to church to worship the Lord. So, you are supposed to be very decent."" I was there and said to this layman, ""Would you please take off your shoes and give them to this young man so that they can put them on, and walk into church and worship the Lord. And you wear the sandals outside the church because you are not there inside anyway. In the next service, when he comes out, he can give back the shoes and go home with his shoes."" He was not happy at all. I insist, but he did not do it. Anyway these two young men entered the church were being exposed to the grace of the Lord, being exposed to love of the Lord Jesus Christ. Brothers and sisters, let me ask you, which is more important? Obeying the rules of not entering the church with sandals, or being exposed to the grace of God? I am sure your answer would be that being exposed to the grace of the Lord is more important than wearing decent clothes. The answer is obvious.Legalism, always, all the time, will lead to hypocrisy. Because legalism makes you feel good, make you feel pure, make you feel like Im more committed, Im more devoted than other people. I am better than you are. I have better faith than you have. Im better than you! Legalist hypocrisy always results in this. And that is exactly what Jesus Christ wanted to urge people to destroy, because when Jews come to worship, come to Jerusalem for Passover, they were required by the priest to offer doves, cattle, and lamb as a sacrifice. And then give a tenth of what they get to the temple as a tithe. And the priests do not care if they are growing in their spirit. The priest didnt even care to ask, Are you growing in the spirit of the Lord? All they required was that you come to church with a sacrifice; you come to church with money. Thats all you are supposed to do. That is whatthat is legalism. That is hypocrisy. And that is something that Jesus wanted to destroy. And the people that practiced that kind of legalism, Jesus will never entrust His life to. Jesus will never entrust His life to these kinds of people.In Luke chapter 18, Jesus was telling a parable. One day, two people came to the temple. One is a Pharisee, and the other is a tax collector. And this Pharisee stood up and prayed. What he was saying was so legalistic and hypocritical. This is what he was saying: Lord, my Heavenly Father, I am not like those evil-doers. I am not like those adulterers. Im not like those sinners. Im not even like this tax collector. Why? Because I fast twice a week. And I give a tenth of what I get to you. Lord, Im good. Lord, Im better than this tax collector. I am better than all those sinners. I am the one you are supposed to be pleased with! This is what? This is legalism. This is hypocrisy. And this is what Jesus wanted to urge people to destroy. And these people  the people who practice this kind of legalism  Jesus wouldnt entrust His life to. Not only so, but Jesus also wouldnt entrust His life to people who believe as a result of only being able to see the signs. The miraculous works, the signs and wonders done by Jesus. In Mark 8:22, the Bible tells us, They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the mans eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, Do you see anything? He looked up and said, I see people; they look like trees walking around. Once more Jesus put his hands on the mans eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. 26Jesus sent him home, saying, Dont even go into the village. Why did Jesus ask him not to go into the village. Why did Jesus stop him from going into the village? Because the people, everybody that lived in the village knew him, knew he was blind. And now he was able to see. He was able to read. He was able to look at things. So they would be very surprised and ask, What happened to him? and he would say, Well, Jesus Christ healed me. He was so mighty that I was healed. I was saved. Then people would flood out from the village and follow Jesus for his healing, rather than for his salvation. But what Jesus was supposed to do in this world was to tell the people in this world that He is the Son of God and that He came here for the salvation of the people of the world. That is the call of the Gospel. That is the call of good news. So He didnt want His time completely occupied and wasted in healings. So thats why He told this person not to go to the village. And brothers and sisters, you know that back in those days there wasnt a  in that village. There wasnt a  in that village. When people were sick, all they could do was let out some blood, or do some completely, entirely non-medical thing.So, brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ was to intend for people to destroy the temple. The very people who worship the Lord carelessly, unconcernedly, legalistically. Where people worship the Lord because of the sign that they saw. Brothers and sisters, I wanted to ask you a question: Do you believe in the Lord carelessly, unconcernedly, legalistically? Or believe in Jesus because of the miraculous signs of Jesus done in your home, in your family, or in your life? If so, destroy they temple, so that Jesus can entrust Himself to you. May the Word of the Lord be with you. Amen. May the praise and the glory be to our Father in heaven. Amen."

Naomi said to her, Go ahead, my daughter.3 So she went our and began to glean in the fields behind the harvester. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.4 Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvester, The LORD be with you! And they said to him, Jehovah bless you.5 Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, Whose young woman is that?6 The foreman replied, She is the Moabitess who came back form Moab with Naomi.7 She said, Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters. She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.8 So Boaz said to Ruth, My daughter, listen to me, Dont go and glean in another field and dont go away from here. Say here with my servant girls.9 Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the girls. I have told the men not to touch you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.10 At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She exclaimed, Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me a foreigner?Today our sermon topic is In Gods Hands. Welcome Larry.Thank you. Good morning my friends. It is my privilege to share the Word of God with you this morning. Today we will continue our series on the book of Ruth. Today we are going to study Ruth 2. Lets bow our heads to pray and get started.Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for your unchanging love and your salvation. Lord, we come to you as we open your Word today, asking you to speak to us, speak to our heart. We want to hear from you. Lord, I pray for those who are lost, who are facing difficult times and challenges. Lord, please bring and give them much hope, strength and faith. Pray in Jesus name, Amen.Ok. Well, let me ask you a question, how many of you have read the book of Ruth, could you raise your hands? I want to see. If you have read the book of Ruth, could you raise your hands? Ok, some of you have read the book of Ruth. Some of you have not, I encourage you to get a Bible if you do not have a Bible. Introduction to and background of RuthThe book of Ruth is in the Old Testament. It is a very short book. It has only four chapters. The book of Ruth is a well-written and beautiful story, and a true story. It talks about a family that went through some tragedies and lost some family members. In the midst of that, God brings good into their lives. God blesses them. God uses a rich man called Boaz and redeems the family. Redeem means being rescued or paying back or purchasing back something. This story of redemption really points to Jesus. Maybe some of you are new to this church. Maybe you have never read the Bible. One of the things I want to tell you is that the way we look at the Bible, the Scripture, is that the Bible is the Word of God. God speaks to us through His Word, and Jesus is the main character of the Bible. The Bible is about Jesus, and Jesus connects all the dots together. And Jesus is our redeemer. He saves us from our sins. That is in the Bible. So if you take Jesus out of the Bible, it will be just a normal book. So every time you read the Bible, you need to think about, what does it say about Jesus? So this story we just read, the book of Ruth, is about Jesus ancestors. It is a great picture of Jesus redemption. I want to help you catch up with this story here, so that we can be on the same page. The story took place in the time of Judges. It was about two thousand years before the birth of Jesus and it was about three thousand years from now. It was a time of sins and rebelling. It was one of the darkest periods of Israel history. The story started at Bethlehem, which is where Jesus was born. Bethlehem simply means the house of bread. But in that period, there was no bread, there was a famine. So there was an ordinary Israeli man called Elimelech, who took his wife Naomi and two sons, left Bethlehem, and moved for fifteen miles to the country called Moab. Then the husband died after they moved there. The two sons married Moabite women. One was called Orpah, and the other called Ruth. However, the two sons both died. There were three widows left. So Naomi decided to go back to Bethlehem. She asked her daughters-in-law to stay in their homeland and go back to their family, because it was just extremely difficult for a foreign widow to find a new husband in Israel. So Orpah went back to her homeland, went back to her family. But Ruth insisted in staying with Naomi. She said: Where you go I will go, where you stay I will stay, your people will be my people, your God my God, where you died, I will die. (Ruth 1:16-17)That is incredible! You know, Ruth faithfully followed Naomi and went back to Bethlehem. So when they went back to Bethlehem, some people recognized Naomi and they said: Can this be Naomi? (Ruth 1:19)The name of Naomi means pleasant. You know, what Naomi said? She said: Dont call me Naomi, call me Mara (which means bitter), I went away full, but came back empty. (Ruth 1:20-21)First point: trust God even when things are difficultI know some of you are facing difficult challenges, and going through some difficult times right now. You are wondering, Where are you, God? I was full, but now I am empty. Where are you, God? You know the Bible tells us, God is good. He loves us. He brings good into our lives. If you look at James chapter one, verse seventeen (it is shown on the slide), Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.Doubt and the concept of sinYou know God is our Heavenly Father. He loves us. He never changes. He brings good into our lives. Some of you may ask, So if God is good, why does he allow the evil to exist? Why does bad thing happen? Can you tell me why? I think the answer is very simple - because of love. Because of love; God loves us, so that evil exists, bad things happen. Let me tell you why. You know, every time we think about evil, we think about someone else or something else. Let me tell you, every one of us has something evil inside us. In order to get rid of all the evil, God had to get rid of you and me. We are living in a sinful world, and sin creates a lot of problems. You know, some problems come from our own hands. It is our problem. I think the source of problem does not really matter. We need to believe, we need to know that God can turn it around, and bring good into our life. God can teach us lessons, and develop in us good characteristics and faith. One day we will find the blessing and benefit from it. I know, nobody likes suffering, nobody enjoys pain. Is that true? Yeah? Who likes suffering and pain? Nobody. I believe nobody likes suffering and pain. But I want to remind you that do not focus your eyes on the environment or problems, because the environment and problems can only discourage us, and we can feel fearful. Let me give an example. If we only focus on our problems, our eyes (focused) on problems, lets say, the problem is like the size of my mobile phone; if you only focus on the problems, all you see is problems; we cannot see other things; you cannot see God. But I want to remind you today, focus your eyes on Jesus, look up, be joyful always, pray continually, and give thanks in all circumstances, because we know our God lives, we know He brings good things into our lives. We trust Him. That is our God. A tragedy turning goodThe story of Ruth started with tragedy. In the midst of that, God was going to do good things and bless the family. In chapter two, it is told that there was a rich man called Boaz. His name means strength. So Boaz is a relative of Naomis husbands. One day Ruth said to Naomi, Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor. (Ruth 2:2)You can make a note of or underline favor, which means grace in Hebrew. Naomi replied, Go ahead, my daughter. So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters. You need to understand it - a young foreign woman went to the fields to pick up the leftovers among poor people after a famine. That was dangers, and their life hit the lowest bottom. She could have easily been mistreated or hurt. But Ruth had faith and was trusting. When I read this, (I know) God was going to do good things. He was going to give someone with a heart for you and me, and we will find favor in his or her eyes. He or she will take care of us. God will never let us down. This is faith. She did not just sit at home await, doing nothing. But she trusted God and took action. Second point: trust God with our actions.James 2:17 says,Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.You know, God does not want us to become just Bible experts, memorizing lots of verses. He wants us to live out, really believing it and taking actions. Ruth went out to the field in faith. The Bible says, it JUST happened, it JUST turn out. And she found herself working in the fields belonging to Boaz. This is very interesting. She was working in the fields of Boaz who was rich, a single man and also a relative of Naomis husbands. She HAPPENED to pick the fields of Boaz out of all the fields. She HAPPENED to go there on the day when Boaz also HAPPENED to be in the fields. He HAPPENED to see her. We know that did not just happen; it was not coincidence or luck. You know this HAPPENED because of God, Gods provision, and God guided her there. If you listened to prayers, we usually pray like this, - God, please do this, God, please do that. It seems like God is not doing His part; it seems like God is lazy; it seems like God needs a job. You know I believe God is at work all the time. God is in control; we are in Gods hands. He gives us responsibility; He gives us a role to play. God can work through us. There is something we can do. Larrys personal testimonyI want to share my story with you. I hope you can get some encouragement. It can encourage you. Many of you may have heard my story before. I had studied in England for six years and found the Lord there, and came back to China, and moved to Beijing, got married, and then I started to worry, I thought of the responsibilities when I got married. I was thinking, oh, I needed to make more money. I needed to make more money for my family, you know, to provide a good economic base so that they can live a happy life. I worried a lot about how to take care of my parents, how to take care of my children, all these questions came into my mind. I think it is our human nature that we want to build many invisible walls for security by ourselves. Some people believe money can bring security. So they work extremely hard to get more money, to get more money. Some people believe job can really help them to have security. They work hard for that job. And some people believe that authority, power, can give them security. They work hard and want a higher position. Over the years God teaches me to trust Him - He is the only one that can give me the true security. I should not trust money in the bank accounts. Amen. I think that is the same thing we (all) need to do. Many of you might have heard that we just had our first child. Her name is Joy. Now she is eight months old. Many people asked how this child was doing. I want to show you a couple of pictures. I hope you do not complain that I show you her pictures every time. She is beautiful! And this is another one. She is starting to call daddy, and when I get home, that just warms my heats, just to see the baby calls you daddy. I just found my heat feeling very thankful; she is a present from God. We are also very thankful for our parents; they are willing to take care of her for us when we are at work. But my wife and I felt that we had the responsibility to take care of her and teach her. So my wife and I decided that she should quit her job and be a full-time mom. And she has already done that. Next Friday will be her last working day. She has a good job, and she really likes working at that company. We do not have much saving, but we believe that God will provide; we believe that we are in His hands; He is in control. We just need to step out in faith, and we did that. I want to encourage you that there may be something you have been thinking for a long time. You just need to step out in faith, trusting God that He is in control, and we are in His hand. God is in control of Ruths lifeVerse 4, just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted harvesters, The Lord be with you!Notice the greeting to the workers from Boaz. Maybe some of you are managers or in charge of some people. I want to tell you that we can always pray for and bless them, and be a blessing among the people. The workers replied, The Lord be with you! Boaz saw that Ruth was picking up the leftover grain, and he asked someone in charge, Whose young woman is that? The man told Boaz about Ruth, She is the Moabite who came back from Moab with Naomi; she has worked hard from morning till now, except for a short rest. Boaz noticed Ruth was a lonely outsider, a foreigner, who was gleaning in his field. You may know Moab is a traditional enemy of Israel, and Ruth was from there. They are enemy countries. Boaz could have ignored her or driven her away, or responded in many other ways. But if you read the story, you will find out that Boaz showed great kindness to her. Please look at the screen, the Bible tells us,He gets Ruth to glean in his fields (Ruth2:8) so that she does not need to go away;He offers her protection among his own workers, and she can follow along with his servant girls (Ruth2:8-9);He also offers her water, in that culture, women should fill the jars with water by herself (Ruth2:9);Boaz provides her with lunch (Ruth2:14);He gives her food to take home (Ruth2:18); andTell the workers to leave stalks for her (Ruth2:15-16).Verse 10, Ruth said, Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me - a foreigner? In other words, what have I done to deserve this? You see the story is connected to Jesus - what have we done to deserve Gods grace? Nothing, salvation does not come by work, we cannot earn it, but it is by the grace of God.Verse 12 Boaz even prayed for Ruth, read this, May the Lord repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge. Third point: show kindness to othersInterestingly, Boaz prayed for Ruth for blessings, and then later in the book, he answered that prayer by becoming the source of blessings. Isnt it interesting that we always pray for someone, something or some ministry, and God can use us to bless that person, that ministry, and God can use you to answer that. Boaz was a godly man. He not only showed kindness to his workers, but also showed great kindness to Ruth, a foreign widow, even if she was from an enemy country. My third point is to show kindness to others. I just want to ask you whom should we show kindness to. Our family, co-workers, friends, or brothers and sisters? Let us read this, the Bible says, 43You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' 44But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45that you may be sons of your Father in heaven.(Mathew5:43-45) There are a lot of media out there, you name it, newspaper, magazine, television programs, internet, weibo these days (very popular) and twitter, and all kind of media out there. And they are trying to influence us, teaching us something and pleasing to our eyes. Are these all right? How do I know what is right and what is wrong? We always need to go back to the Bible. The Bible is the guide for our life. God asks us to love our enemies, to show kindness to them and pray for them. That means including loving the people you do not like. You properly do not like to hear the next thing I am going to say, but I want to say it anyway - that means including loving people from Japan. Love the people you do not really like, maybe they are family members, co-workers, even brothers and sisters in this room; but love them and pray for them.Verse 19 Naomi was so surprised when Ruth came home with all the grains, she asked, Where did you glean today? Ruth told her what happened that it was not luck or coincidence. Naomi knew this because she said in verse 20, He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead. I have talked about a lot of things today, but I know you did not happen to sit here, you did not happen to hear the message. I do not want you to go back with a bunch of knowledge. My prayer is that God really changes our heart that we can trust Him, knowing that He is in control, and we are in His hands. He brings good to our life, no matter what kind of situation you are facing right now, trust Him and follow Him. There are probably something we cannot do, God gives the real responsibility to pray about the things we cannot do, trust Him and follow Him. God knows you better than everyone else. He has a master plan for you.Lets pray, Heavenly Father, we want to thank you, thanks for your Word and the good examples in the Bible. We want to thank you for you are the faithful God, and you never change that we can trust you, and we thankthat you love us. Father, I ask you to give us a sensitive heart that we can see the needs of others; we can show our kindness to others. Lord, I am just so thankful. Pray in Jesus name, amen!Transcribed and edited by Esther, Feel, Franz and Liu Laoshi; thanks be to our Lord, our redeemer!"

Naomi said to her, Go ahead, my daughter.3 So she went our and began to glean in the fields behind the harvester. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.4 Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvester, The LORD be with you! And they said to him, Jehovah bless you.5 Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, Whose young woman is that?6 The foreman replied, She is the Moabitess who came back form Moab with Naomi.7 She said, Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters. She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.8 So Boaz said to Ruth, My daughter, listen to me, Dont go and glean in another field and dont go away from here. Say here with my servant girls.9 Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the girls. I have told the men not to touch you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.10 At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She exclaimed, Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me a foreigner?Today our sermon topic is In Gods Hands. Welcome Larry.Thank you. Good morning my friends. It is my privilege to share the Word of God with you this morning. Today we will continue our series on the book of Ruth. Today we are going to study Ruth 2. Lets bow our heads to pray and get started.Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for your unchanging love and your salvation. Lord, we come to you as we open your Word today, asking you to speak to us, speak to our heart. We want to hear from you. Lord, I pray for those who are lost, who are facing difficult times and challenges. Lord, please bring and give them much hope, strength and faith. Pray in Jesus name, Amen.Ok. Well, let me ask you a question, how many of you have read the book of Ruth, could you raise your hands? I want to see. If you have read the book of Ruth, could you raise your hands? Ok, some of you have read the book of Ruth. Some of you have not, I encourage you to get a Bible if you do not have a Bible. Introduction to and background of RuthThe book of Ruth is in the Old Testament. It is a very short book. It has only four chapters. The book of Ruth is a well-written and beautiful story, and a true story. It talks about a family that went through some tragedies and lost some family members. In the midst of that, God brings good into their lives. God blesses them. God uses a rich man called Boaz and redeems the family. Redeem means being rescued or paying back or purchasing back something. This story of redemption really points to Jesus. Maybe some of you are new to this church. Maybe you have never read the Bible. One of the things I want to tell you is that the way we look at the Bible, the Scripture, is that the Bible is the Word of God. God speaks to us through His Word, and Jesus is the main character of the Bible. The Bible is about Jesus, and Jesus connects all the dots together. And Jesus is our redeemer. He saves us from our sins. That is in the Bible. So if you take Jesus out of the Bible, it will be just a normal book. So every time you read the Bible, you need to think about, what does it say about Jesus? So this story we just read, the book of Ruth, is about Jesus ancestors. It is a great picture of Jesus redemption. I want to help you catch up with this story here, so that we can be on the same page. The story took place in the time of Judges. It was about two thousand years before the birth of Jesus and it was about three thousand years from now. It was a time of sins and rebelling. It was one of the darkest periods of Israel history. The story started at Bethlehem, which is where Jesus was born. Bethlehem simply means the house of bread. But in that period, there was no bread, there was a famine. So there was an ordinary Israeli man called Elimelech, who took his wife Naomi and two sons, left Bethlehem, and moved for fifteen miles to the country called Moab. Then the husband died after they moved there. The two sons married Moabite women. One was called Orpah, and the other called Ruth. However, the two sons both died. There were three widows left. So Naomi decided to go back to Bethlehem. She asked her daughters-in-law to stay in their homeland and go back to their family, because it was just extremely difficult for a foreign widow to find a new husband in Israel. So Orpah went back to her homeland, went back to her family. But Ruth insisted in staying with Naomi. She said: Where you go I will go, where you stay I will stay, your people will be my people, your God my God, where you died, I will die. (Ruth 1:16-17)That is incredible! You know, Ruth faithfully followed Naomi and went back to Bethlehem. So when they went back to Bethlehem, some people recognized Naomi and they said: Can this be Naomi? (Ruth 1:19)The name of Naomi means pleasant. You know, what Naomi said? She said: Dont call me Naomi, call me Mara (which means bitter), I went away full, but came back empty. (Ruth 1:20-21)First point: trust God even when things are difficultI know some of you are facing difficult challenges, and going through some difficult times right now. You are wondering, Where are you, God? I was full, but now I am empty. Where are you, God? You know the Bible tells us, God is good. He loves us. He brings good into our lives.

We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.""2:3 When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.2:4 When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.2:5 ""In Bethlehem in Judea,"" they replied, ""for this is what the prophet has written:2:6 But you, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of people Israel.""2:7 Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.2:8 He sent them to Bethlehem and said, ""Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.""2:9 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.2:10 When they saw the starthey were overjoyed.2:11 On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshipedhim. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.2:12 And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another routeJohn 8:128:12 Then Jesus spoke out again, I am the light of the world. The one who follows me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.Speaker: Pastor Gloria LiGood morning, everyone.  Please join me with a short prayer. Dear heavenly father, thank you so much for gathering us together. Lord when we come to you, please give us your light, your true light to shine in our hearts, help us get rid of all the darkness and to walk in the light. May all of us here see your glory. Through todays service, may your name be exalted through your message. May your words comfort our hearts. May your words become our hope, light, joy and life. Lord, please be with us. May your holy spirit be with us so that we can have a pure heart to listen to your words. No matter the listener or the speaker, may we be touched by yours words. We pray in your name. Amen.Opening part:Jinglan just read the message gospel of Matthew 2:1:12. The story we just read is about the birth of Jesus. We are all so familiar with the story. We just celebrate the Christmas. We have just seen from the video. It shares with us the Christmas Eve in Haidian church when we had four services. The top purpose is to celebrate the birth of Jesus. It tells about several wise men who rode camels from the east to Bethlehem. It took the wise men about two months to make this journey. It was a long journey. It was not like travel today. If I want to go to the Germany, I will arrive there thirteen hours later. Why were these wise men willing to travel so long from the east to Bethlehem? In order to worship the baby Jesus. Why did they take so long from one place to another place. Why did they want to worship Jesus? Jesus is the king of Jewish people. Jesus is the king of the whole world. How about us? We dont need to take a long trip to go to Jesus. He is already with us, He is near us. Our body is his temple. Jesus is dwelling in our body. He is always with us. As long as Jesus is near us, how do we worship Him? Just attending the service is not enough; just attending the Christmas Eve service is not enough. We know that Christmas Day has already passed. We have already celebrated Jesus birth through many different services at the church. We know from: John8:12 Then Jesus spoke out again, I am the light of the world. The one who follows me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.Jesus is the light of the world. This baby, whose birth we have just celebrated, John 8 :1, says Jesus is the true light of the world. He will shine upon this world. So he is the light of the world. He is the light among us.How do we response to the true light? This Sunday is the last Sunday of 2012. Our theme  throughout this year has been walking as children of light. This year we have studied Ephesians, and the book of Ruth. We had series of sermons on work, and on love and courtship. Through these messages, we tried to know this True Light better, and learn how to live as children of light. What does it mean to live as children of light? It means that after we get to know this light, we need to respond to this light. So what is our response to Him? Let us consider two aspects of transformation as we respond to Him. The first aspect of transformation is about our identity as Gods people. We must remember that we are heavenly people, we are children of the True Light, and we are temporary residents in the world.The wise men presented the baby Jesus with gifts of gold, incense and myrrh. This was their response to Jesus, the true light of the world--to worship Him with the best gifts they could think of. Gold is a gift for royalty, so the wise men were recognizing that Jesus is the king. We all that know Jesus is our king. Sometimes we claim that He is the king of kings. He is the Lord of lords. If a person is called a king, he should have a country. So Jesus has His kingdom. Who belong to His kingdom? All people who trust in Him, including you and me. Do you know that you are heavenly people, that you belong to the kingdom of our Godthe wonderful, awesome, great, and marvelous God? The Apostle Paul reminds us that Jesus kingdom is the kingdom of light. In Colossians 1:12-13, he says that we should give thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves. So our Gods kingdom is the kingdom of light. In Matthew6 Jesus told us to seek his kingdom and righteousness first. Let this thought enlighten your imagination: Your identity is being the people of Gods kingdom, you are the children of the True light. In Ephesians 5:8, Paul says: You were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Paul said this to encourage the Ephesians to live as children of light. Have you thanked God for your identity? As we are children of light, we belong to Gods kingdom, we know that we dont belong to this world, but are temporary residents in the world. Even though we are temporary residents in the world, we have the responsibility to live as children of the True Light in the world, to be the light of this world, to show Gods light to this world, and to live with an eternal perspective in this world. If you live in Beijing, you should be the light of Beijing. If you work in a company, you should be the light to shine in this company. If you marry to somebody, you should be the light shining to your life partner. If you are a friend, so be the light to shine your friends. As you are the children of God. We can see Gods greatness in this world which He has created. The universe reflects Gods kingdom.                          Do you know how many galaxies there are in the universe? There are more than three hundred and fifty billion, and this is a conservative estimate. And think about all the human beings in this world! There are men, women, young people, old people, Chinese people and foreigners. The universe and the human beings show us how great our God is. He created this universe in adversity. He gave us His most beloved Son to rescue us from darkness and bring us into His light, to save us from death and give us life. His kingdom is forever. His light will shine forever. In His kingdom, you can taste true joy, light, love, peace and life. He is not just the king in heaven. He is the king who will always think about you, care about you and love you unconditionally. And you and I are in this wonderful kingdom. We are so blessed to be His children. Have you ever praised God because of your identity in Him? Have you ever given thanks to our God for His greatness? Have you ever given thanks for His Kingdom? Please remember, we are so blessed to be the people of His kingdom, to the children of the True Light. Almost all of us have done some travelling. When you travel, you probably dont care very much about what you are going to eat and drink, and where you will sleep during your trip. Because you know that place is not your home, you are just staying there temporarily. Even though you could face some trouble, you know everything will go away soon. But for us, we often forget that we are living temporarily in this world. Our home is not here, our home is in heaven; we are the people of Gods kingdom. If we can have an eternal perspective on our life in the world, we will have a different attitude for facing our daily situations, and our behavior will change. How do you act out this identity in your daily life? Even though we do not belong to the world, God doesnt save us to get us out of the world. God saves us to have us start living for eternity in this world. Have we had the attitude of starting to live for eternity now, in our own life? If we remember our identity and practice it in our own life, our life will be totally different. For example, suppose you are at the workplace and face a big problem. But when you know that you are a child of the True Light, you will have an positive attitude to solve your problem. You will be confident that you work for Him, for His kingdom, and no matter how big the problem is, God will be in your work, and He will work with you, you are not alone. If you are married, treat your wife or husband as the Lord told us in the Bible. In this way, we can act out our identity in our daily life. The apostle Paul knew his identity. So he could say: Our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. (2 Corinthians 4:17) How does he describe his troubles?  light and momentary. How does he describe the glory that his troubles will achieve?eternal glory that far outweighs them. How about us? How do we describe our own sufferings that we are facing? Are they light and momentary for us? If we remember that we are the people of Gods kingdom, children of the True Light, then we will be very positive to face all the situations in our own lives. We will have a totally different lifestyle. We will be eager for Gods kingdom, and seek all the things that please God and that He cares about. Dear brothers and sisters, Psalm 90:10 says: The length of our days is seventy yearsor eighty, if we have the strength. But our eternal life is forever, with no end. Think about it. Let me give you an example: Our life in the world is like a bottle of water, and our eternal life is like a sea. But for most of us, we sometimes use all of our energy, our eyes, and our heart to focus on the bottle of water, and we forget the vastness of the sea. Does this reflect our life? We forget that we have eternal life. Our life will never end. So brothers and sisters, I encourage you to focus on Jesus.So, instead of trying to find a good job, looking for a life partner, making more money, what we should I do? What does it really mean to seek Gods kingdom first for me personally in my everyday life? How do we live eternity on earth? It means God should be put number one place in our heart. We should seek to please Him in every small thing in our lives. Dear brothers and sisters, open your eyes. Your life can be totally different. You need to live for Him only. Like the apostle Paul, you need to have the right attitude to look at all the things happening in your life, and be positive to solve all the problems you face. You know that many things you are pursuing may change immediately. You dont know the length of your life on earth. You dont know what will happen tomorrow. But we do know that Gods kingdom never changes, the true light never goes out. How do we really live with our true identity? Do whatever He commands us in the Bible. When you solve anything in your life, remember that you are the children of light, the people of Gods kingdom. It will never go away and it will last forever.  The wise men came to worship the baby Jesus. How about us - how do we worship Him? We can worship the Lord by remembering our identity as heavenly people, children of the True light and acting it out in our daily life. I am sure this is the beautiful way to worship our Lord during this Christmas season. How do we live as children of light?Let us go on to the second aspect of transformation in responding to Jesus, the True Light. This is about our calling to be the messengers of Jesus Christ.The wise men were guided by the star, so they could come from the east to Jerusalem. God uses a star to lead the wise men to the baby Jesus. Shall we be used by God like that star? From Matthew 5:14-16, we know that Jesus makes us the light of the world today. He said: You are the light of the world. Being light means shining and giving people light. Shall we be the light to deliver the gospel to the people who are in the dark now?We know that today many people in the world live in darkness, just like at the time of Jesus birth, when Herod tried to kill the baby Jesus. The Jewish people were full of shame and hopelessness as they lived under Roman rule. They needed Gods salvation. December 1st was World AIDS Day. There are 2031 persons who were infected by AIDS in Beijing this year. The main cause for the spread of the AIDS infection is sexual relations outside of marriage. Why the sexual impurity could be the top reason? It is because many people are living in the dark and lose control of their sexual passions.And many people are facing psychological problems. Depressionis the top mental disease. There are sixteen million people suffering from depression in China. There are two hundred and eighty thousand people who commit suicide because of depression every year. On the average, one person commits suicide every 20 seconds. Why do they commit suicide? Their hearts are in the dark. They do not have hope in this world. They need Jesus, they need salvation. They need hope in this world.So brothers and sisters, I want to encourage you to be the light of this world. Deliver the message to them.Sometimes you feel there is no effect when you share the gospel with others, please remember that it is not your responsibility to make others trust in God. Your part is to share the gospel, and to bring people to the light. Gods part is to transform them into children of light. Dont be discouraged with your work, but be confident, for you dont work alone, God is with you. You are joining Him in His work, the work of His kingdom.  Can you count how many hours have you worked for the eternal seed? So let us deliver the gospel to someone who has no joy, and is hopeless, full of worry. We can share eternal life to the people who want to live longer and pursue a high quality life.Can you imagine that God can use you and me to be His testimony?Our college fellowship held an evangelistic service on December 15. Before the service started, I was a little bit nervous, because I had never spoken in an evangelistic service before. I didnt know how to speak so that non-believers could easily understand and then accept Jesus as their own Savior. About half an hour before the service started, we prayed together. Through the prayer, I knew that I was working with God, that I was simply joining God in His work. The service was not about me, it was all about Him. He could do wonderful things beyond my imagination. I could put everything in His hands. He would be in charge of the service. My responsibility was to glorify Him. His responsibility was to draw people He wanted to save. So I was comforted by Him. And there were about one hundred people that came to the front to accept Jesus as their own Savior. This is all His work, praise Him. So dear brothers and sisters, come on, work with our great God, to be His messengers, to deliver His good news to people in the darkness. Conclusion:So dear brothers and sisters, I want to encourage you to be the messengers of Jesus Christ in the following year. Our Lord is the true light. From today, we know, our response to the true light is to remember that we are heavenly people, we are children of the true light, we have an eternal perspective to face all the things we encounter in our own life. God calls us to be the messengers of Jesus Christ, to deliver Gods light, life, hope, joy and salvation to the people in the dark. Lets make these our wishes or resolutions for the New Year: I affirm thatI am a person of Gods kingdom, I am a child of the True Light, I am a temporary resident in this world, I will seek Gods kingdom first, I will act out this identity in my own life, I will be the messenger to deliver the true joy, peace, love, hope, light and life to people who live in dark.May Lord bless all of us and we can follow him with our actions. Amen. PAGE   \* MERGEFORMAT 2"
